"December 24, 2010","The way Kosovo is achieving independence has been welcomed with antithetical opinions in the international community, especially with respect to international law. This paper attempts to shed light on the legal trajectory which brought Kosovo on the way to statehood. After determining that Kosovo has not, prima facie, any positive right to independence, its de facto statehood is contrasted with a few doctrines that could contribute to support it, namely self-determination, remedial secession theory, and international dispositive powers. The analysis finds that Kosovo independence might be legally justifiable under a collective recognition theory, possibly supported with remedial arguments. Having further enquired over the effectiveness and the legitimacy of its independent status (statehood criteria), this article contends that such turn of developments in Kosovo is better explained through more genuine political reasoning. The validity of independence as a solution is not debated in itself, but on the basis of the whole process the negative effects of reaching such outcome by the way of a one-sided decision are discussed."
"December 23, 2010","The study of state formation often focuses on building state capacity. The formation and subsequent bolstering of state capacity, however, are distinctly different activities. While the study of state capacity building has provided considerable insight into the role of formal institutions in maintaining stable governance, the implicit assumption in this work is the existence of a state upon which to build capacity. The collective decision to formalize institutions into a state - a necessary prior condition for building state capacity - is rarely addressed. In the following paper the role of informal institutions; specifically, social networks as informal institutions, in the process of state germination is explored. Using Afghanistan as a framework for the discussion, the research presented below attempts to illustrate the importance of the initial structural conditions of these networks, and the actors therein, in this process.  The paper begins with a brief description of the role of informal institution and social networks in Afghanistan. Next, a provision point public goods game is presented as a basic model of the collective action problem inherent in state formation.  Then, a network variant of this game is presented, which is implemented as a computational model. In the final sections the results of simulations from the computational model are presented, with a discussion and conclusions."
"December 22, 2010","The present article presents at first a German language summary about recent quantitative studies by the author and his associates about global development since the end of Communism in up to 175 nations of the world, using 26 predictor variables to evaluate the determinants of 30 processes of development on a global scale."
"December 22, 2010","This ethnographic essay investigates the relations between past and present forms of Islam in the north Caucasian Republic of Daghestan. Conversations culled from fieldwork in Daghestani urban and rural spaces are used to elucidate the cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity of life in this region. Ethnographies in a bookstore, a shrine to the Imam Shamil, and a scholarly archive in Makhachkala unfold against the historical background of Daghestan’s long-standing encounter with the Arabo-Islamic world. The essay explores how the post-Soviet turn to post-secular Islam represents an alternative to colonialism and a new way of making meaning in the present. It is intended as a contribution to Islamic studies, modernity theory, and post-Soviet Union area studies."
"December 22, 2010","The econometric study of civil war is increasing recognized to suffer from problems of 'over-aggregation'. As such, there is a high risk of estimation biases, ecological fallacies, and endogeneity problems. In this paper, I seek to contribute to the disaggregation of the study of civil war by focusing on the socio-economic dynamics of secessionist conflict as an identifiably distinct subset of ‘civil wars’, and by using a new subnational dataset compiled for this purpose. I test a series of hypotheses relating to the socio-economic conditions that encourage secessionism and political institutions that might mediate it. In contrast to the mainstream literature on civil war, I find  a very strong predictive role for a measure of ethnic diversity in accounting for the incidence of secession. I also find a relatively straightforward set of socio-economic relationships. The relationship between relative socio-economic performance and conflict incidence is non-linear: regions that suffer from high 'horizontal inequalities' - whether relatively poor or relatively rich - in relation to the rest of the country are more prone to secessionism. The presence of hydrocarbon deposits also dramatically increases the likelihood of secessionism. But the institutional story is more complex and contingent upon interaction effect with the degree of ethnic diversity and the level of horizontal inequality."
"December 21, 2010","""Diplomatic assurances"" are promises not to torture. The US and other traditionally rights-respecting governments have sought these assurances when sending detainees, usually terrorism suspects, to foreign authorities known for torture. This report, the culmination of several years of research by the Human Rights Institute, presents the evolving evidence and jurisprudence of assurances. Without taking a position on whether assurances can work, it describes elements that are necessary to make assurances plausible: judicial review, public scrutiny, and systematic monitoring."
"December 21, 2010","The US should ensure that detainees it apprehends and transfers to Afghan authorities are treated humanely. Just as long-term detention operations in Afghanistan are politically sensitive and pose a strategic liability to US interests, US detainee transfer practices may undercut the counterinsurgency strategy to ""win hearts and minds"" of the Afghan public insofar as they are associated with abuse or collusion with abusers."
"December 20, 2010","The article begins with a discussion of an empirical study that found a disjunction between the underlying assumptions and goals of media libel law, on the one hand, and the real interests of the parties and what the system actually accomplishes, on the other. The article then discusses several responses that have been proposed to address the problems of the libel litigation system. These include the media’s prevention of suits with better handling of complaints, expanded use of the special verdict, declaratory judgments, and nonlitigation alternatives. An experimental, voluntary, alternative program is described, along with a case that illustrates the potential benefits of such an alternative process."
"December 20, 2010","This chapter describes an experimental alternative program for resolving media libel disputes out of court and explains why the program was created. The chapter first discusses the findings of an empirical study of the libel litigation system. That study found that the primary objectives of plaintiffs who sue for libel are not met by the current system and that the media incur large financial and other costs in defending libel suits. The experimental, voluntary, alternative program that was created in response to these findings is described, along with the potential benefits that it could offer both parties relative to the current system and to other media libel litigation reform proposals."
"December 20, 2010","The recent holding in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (“HLP”) marks a significant shift in First Amendment doctrine, unprecedented since the early twentieth century ""Red Scare"" cases. The HLP decision suggests that free speech principles which have been developing for over half a century - culminating in the paramount protection of ""subversive advocacy"" - are less deserving of adherence in the face of terrorism than in times of ""peace."" Throughout the past several decades of free speech precedent, the Court has retreated from the notion that speech which is disturbing to public opinion (""pernicious in nature"") but benign in its capability to incite imminent lawless action should be afforded lower legal protection. The HLP decision seems to disregard the fact that ""freedom for the thought that we hate"" has been heralded as a cherished American value, critical and fundamental to the preservation of democracy, and setting the U.S. aside as unique from other nations."
"December 20, 2010","The present paper intends to examine the evolution of the European idea in inter-war Romania. On this occasion, I try to have a synthetic presentation of Romanian currents and intellectual evolutions, a history of that idea in inter-war political and intellectual environments. Romanian élites prove to be connected to the evolutions at the European level, offering solutions and professionally commenting the proposals presented."
"December 20, 2010","The development of nanotechnology for military application is an emerging area of research and development, the pace and extent of which has not been fully anticipated by international legal regulation. Nano-weapons are referred to here as objects and devices using nanotechnology or causing effects in nano-scale that are designed or used for harming humans. Such weapons, despite their controversial human and environmental toxicity, are not comprehensively covered by specific, targeted regulation under international law. This article critically examines current international humanitarian law and arms control law regimes to determine whether significant gaps exist in the regulation of nanotechnology focused on offensive military application. It presents and evaluates the reasons why more robust regulatory mechanisms under international law for nano-weapons should, or should not, be considered. Lastly, the strengths and weaknesses of different models of international regulation for nano-weapons will be examined."
"December 20, 2010","The chapter begins with a description of an experimental, voluntary program for resolving media libel disputes out of court and explains why the program was created. The chapter then focuses on the findings of an empirical study that examined parties’ reactions to the program and the factors that affected its use. Parties’ interest in using the ADR program was influenced by their lawyers’ recommendations regarding the program, which were affected by the lawyers’ familiarity with and attitudes toward ADR. Parties’ motives and objectives for the litigation also affected their willingness to use the program. The stage of litigation also played a role. Difficulties getting parties to the table are discussed, as are features that might broaden the appeal of an ADR program."
"December 20, 2010","The influence of the domestic in foreign policy decision-making has tended to be one of the prime concerns in international relations and several scholarly works have investigated the role and impact of political parties, coalition politics, bureaucracy, lobbies and diaspora on foreign policy choices of countries. Equally intriguing has been the literature on the influence of strategic culture on external policies of states. This approach, which could be traced to the writings of Sun Tzu, Thucydides and Clausewitz on national character and to Jack Snyder's 1977 account of the nature of the Soviet state, considers strategic culture of countries to change rather slowly if at all. The case of the Indian strategic culture manifests a similar - semipermanence. Rooted in the politico-strategic thought of Nehru, the country's first prime minister, Indian strategic culture has been characterized by a conspicuous restraint in undertaking conventional realist actions in international politics - a trend more or less unchanged over time. Such a restraint can be identified in the country's policy of nuclear minimalism, its military modernization and in its bilateral strategic relationship with the state of Israel. It is the third phenomenon, that this paper seeks to elaborate. Despite its strong ties with Israel, there is an astonishing lack of publicization of the the relationship, an incessant inclination of the Indian political establishment to pay lip service to the Palestinian cause and an identifiable unwillingness to use the relationship to advance direct military strategic interests- demonstrated for example, in India's refusal to accept Israel's offer of help during the 26/11 terrorist sabotage in Mumbai. The paper therefore, seeks to demonstrate the influence of the prevailing strategic culture of a country on its foreign policy behaviour, using the Indian example as a case in point."
"December 19, 2010","Indonesian Islam’s famous diversity has challenged analysts for over a century. They have dreamed up one dichotomy after another - priests vs. aristocrats, modernists vs. traditionalists, orthodox vs. syncretists (santri vs. abangan), regimists vs. pluralists, radicals vs. moderates. Their motivation was not merely academic - most wanted to contribute to agendas beyond the purely religious. Imperial control, modernisation, democracy, and counter-terrorism have all been projects with a major interest in religion. One important question (too rarely asked) is whether these religious differences can be linked with any other social contrasts, and in particular with socio-economic class. If they can, our insight should expand enormously. Instead of dealing merely with an array of free-floating convictions, we can work with a multi-dimensional analytical field that is broad enough to give rise to comprehensible social forces."
"December 19, 2010","This article assesses whether the Southern Africa Development Community Tribunal (SADC Tribunal) was enabled to, and consequently whether it should, operate as a court. It argues that: (i) the 14 August 2001 amendments to the SADC Treaty did not bring the Protocol on the Tribunal into force, despite vociferous arguments to the contrary, (ii) since the Protocol on the Tribunal was not brought into force in accordance with the peremptory provisions of the SADC Treaty, the Tribunal cannot lawfully operate as a court of law; (iii) the SADC Treaty should be amended to resolve the disputes that have arisen over the legal competency of the Tribunal to act as the regional bloc’s dispute resolution mechanism; (iv) the Tribunal should be split into two, with one Court having human rights jurisdiction and the other jurisdiction over all other specified disputes; and (v) legal instruments providing for both Courts should clearly prescribe the normative legal framework underpinning each of them."
"December 19, 2010","The events of 11 September 2001 led the Australian Government to conduct a review of Australia’s ability to counter terrorism. This article discusses the implications for liberalism of the package of six counter-terrorism Bills introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament as a result of that review."
"December 18, 2010","Over the last decade a growing number of cases brought before U.S. courts have alleged that major multinational corporations were complicit in and benefited from human rights violations committed by agents of foreign governments. These cases concern one of the most disputed questions in international human rights litigation, namely, the availability of secondary or indirect liability and aiding and abetting liability in particular. While the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to address the issue, many District and Circuit Courts have held that aiding and abetting liability is available under the Alien Tort Claims Act (‘ATCA’)."
"December 18, 2010","Anthropologist Eric Wolf sought to problematize the relationship between ideas and power (Wolf 1999); Ideas are more than mere mental constructs that allow for mental representations of the external world. Those very constructs that help us to understand the world, make the world. And in doing so, power is implicated. For Wolf structural power was fascinating and more importantly not completely understood. Moreover, such ideational power has led societies down paths of self-destruction resulting in great human suffering (Wolf 1999)."

"December 18, 2010","This essay features on the global relevance of the political economy of the French political economist Paul Boccara from the viewpoint of quantitative international political economy. Our aim is to draw international attention to the fact that Boccara’s political economy is part and parcel of the wider French language debate on the instability of capitalism and the long economic cycles (Kondratiev cycles), which ranges, from the (former) Maoist Samir Amin to the Communist Boccara and the Trotskyst Ernest Mandel (1923-1995), and which is in good company of a wide variety of attempts to revive the debate on Kondratiev cycles (Devezas, 2006), which was a NATO Advanced Research Workshop on the influence of chance events and socioeconomic long waves in the new arena of asymmetric warfare in Covilhã, Portugal, 14–18 February 2005."
"December 18, 2010","In the aftermath of 11 September, Australia has committed itself to active participation in the 'war on terrorism'. In light of concerns expressed by the Australian government that terrorists might sometimes take the guise of asylum seekers, this article considers whether it is possible for Australia to reconcile its international protection obligations with the war on terrorism and if so how."
"December 18, 2010","The present article describes an empirical study that examined factors that affected parties’ willingness to consider an experimental alternative to litigation in media libel disputes. Parties’ interest in using the ADR program was influenced by their lawyers’ recommendations regarding the program, which were affected by the lawyers’ familiarity with and attitudes toward ADR. Parties’ motives and objectives for the litigation also affected their willingness to use the program. The stage of litigation also affected parties’ interest in the ADR program. Plaintiffs were most interested before they had filed suit; their interest declined as time passed after filing. Media organizations, however, were more interested after some discovery or other pretrial activity had occurred. Lawyers and parties in the few cases that used the alternative program had favorable assessments of the process and its efficiency. Lawyers felt that their discussions about the ADR program facilitated communication about the parties’ real interests. The authors conclude that if media organizations are interested in averting libel suits or in resolving them quickly and inexpensively, they need to take the initiative to propose the use of ADR early in the dispute."
"December 18, 2010","Australia presently has a practice of 'turning around' most unauthorised arrivals without giving them an opportunity to apply for a protection visa. The practice reflects a deliberate choice on the part of the Australian government not to implement Australia's international protection obligations in good faith. The choice is easily explicable in domestic political terms. However, it is not a rational choice for the nation in an era of globalisation. By contrast, a choice to implement Australia's international protection obligations in good faith would be a choice to take responsibility for remaking the world into the sort of place in which we would all prefer to live: a world governed by an international rule of law founded on universal moral principles. This article argues that active moral agency is a choice worth making."
"December 18, 2010","This paper examines, for the first time, the role of a special intelligence collection ship in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.  Other intelligence and information constructs are also examined."
"December 18, 2010","A justice system, and the processes located within it, ought to deliver justice. That seems simple enough. But, of course, delivering justice is never so simple. Justice and the systems that serve it are the creatures of context."
"December 18, 2010","The case of Western Sahara shows how the United Nations operate in the area of conflict resolution. In its efforts to reach an agreement, the United Nations are hostage to contrasting and multidimensional logics and interests which in turn make it very difficult to impose a settlement that is in accordance with international law."
"December 18, 2010","A growing number of uniformed military and government entities are practicing new military disciplines of cyber defense, including computer network defense, computer network exploitation, and computer network attack. This paper provides a practitoner's view of principles of operations in this emerging military domain."
"December 17, 2010","Peacekeeping has long been a central motif in Canadian foreign affairs discourse. For some, Canadian peacekeeping has taken form as a legend: a story anchored in history yet elevated to a higher narrative form through romanticism and nostalgia.  For others, Canada’s peacekeeping heritage is more akin to a myth: the personification of a poetic symbol or abstract ideal adapted to the capacity of a primitive people.  As Canada’s military engagement in Afghanistan draws to an end, debate concerning the role of peacekeeping in Canadian foreign affairs is sure to be rekindled. This article will take stock of this debate and explore the significance of the peacekeeping narrative to Canadian foreign policy beyond Afghanistan. It will be argued that academic discourse often overlooks the most important implication of this debate: that whether or not this narrative is well-founded, its lasting impact on Canada’s cultural imagination and enduring popular support deserve consideration in the formulation of Canadian foreign and defense policy."
"December 17, 2010","This article summarizes the findings of a study examining the effects of a rule requiring lawyers to confer with opposing counsel regarding settlement and ADR early in litigation and to report the results of that discussion to the court.  A comparison of civil litigators' practices before and after the rule was adopted showed no apparent increase in early ADR discussions or in early settlements, the rule's ultimate goal.  After the rule was adopted, lawyers did become more likely to discuss ADR at some point during the litigation, albeit not when prescribed by the rule.  Enforcing the requirement to report to the court did not seem to affect whether lawyers held early discussions, but did seem to increase the likelihood that lawyers filed that report."
"December 17, 2010","The 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty (Treaty) is a model of, international water resources cooperation because it provides a permanent dispute mechanism, the six member International Joint Commission (IJC). Thus, both Canada and the United States have much to celebrate on the 100th anniversary of the Treaty. However, the most interesting aspect of the Treaty is the regime's ability to evolve through state practice beyond its original dispute resolution function, despite the inconsistent support for IJC involvement in transboundary water issues of the United States. The Treaty has been severely criticized by governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), especially in, Canada, for its limitations. Taking the Great Lakes alone, the area is too large and the resource management issues too complex to permit a single governance regime. Nonetheless, the LTC has been able to use the reference process to adapt ""the spirit of the Treaty"" to the new resource challenges, primarily environmental, that the Great Lakes face. This Article offers an example of the power of the IJC to overcome the Treaty's limitations by using its status as an international body to constructively influence the development of a new and important Great Lakes-management regime outside of the Treaty framework."
"December 17, 2010","This article summarizes the findings of an empirical study that examined the usefulness of attorneys’ assessments of mediator skillfulness as a method for monitoring mediator performance.  Attorneys who had participated in federal appellate civil mediation rated the mediator's skillfulness on seven dimensions as part of a larger questionnaire about their mediation experience.  Attorneys gave some of the mediators higher skillfulness ratings than other mediators, and rated individual mediators as more skillful on some dimensions than on other dimensions.  These findings indicate that the attorneys' assessments were sufficiently discriminating and nuanced to reveal differences among the different mediators and among the different skills each mediator possessed. Importantly, the ratings did not simply mirror whether settlement or other favorable outcomes were achieved in mediation. Taken together, these findings suggest that participant assessments could provide an effective means for monitoring mediator performance."
"December 17, 2010","Water lawyers, courts, and others in the water community are fond of quoting the quip attributed to Mark Twain, ""whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over."" Not only is there no evidence that Twain ever uttered these words, but the quote has taken on a life of its own which grossly distorts the nature of water competition disputes, especially state to state competition. Both whiskey and water are for human benefit and exist in sufficient quantities throughout the world to satisfy present and future demand. Meeting these demands will be challenging because water must be managed to counter the problems of mal-distribution in certain places. Nonetheless, the idea that water conflict can and will lead to violence is so powerful that the term ""war"" is often applied to intense but nonviolent conflicts over the use of water.  The war metaphor implies that water conflicts are irresolvable unless one party totally prevails over the other. In reality, water violence happens; when it does, it is generally localized, although water facilities have been military targets. This said, many water disputes, especially international ones, simmer unresolved for decades.  Festering disputes are cause for concern because the ultimate driver in many water conflicts, both peaceful and potentially violent, is the fear of drought."
"December 16, 2010","The libel litigation system does not efficiently or effectively resolve media libel disputes.  Protracted and expensive litigation neither restores plaintiffs’ reputations nor protects media defendants from intrusive discovery and potentially large damage awards.  This article demonstrates how research on the characteristics of the libel litigation process and the interests and concerns of the disputants was synthesized with research on dispute resolution processes to develop an alternative process for resolving libel disputes outside the courts.  The article discusses the potential feasibility of the voluntary, nonlitigation alternative program, informed by research on dispute processing and libel litigation.  An evaluation of the program is being conducted to examine attorney's and parties’ reactions to the program and to assess the extent to which the program provides effective solutions to the problems of the libel litigation system."
"December 16, 2010","This paper looks at the dynamics of drug violence through a property rights lens, building on the work of Alson, Libecap and Mueller on land conflict in the Amazon. In the Americas, high levels of violence are concentrated in dysfunctional drug frontiers, i.e. in areas that have the following characteristics: the drug rent is large relative to the size of the local economy; the state's repressive capabilities are relatively limited; and local competition over the drug rent is poorly self-regulated. These dysfunctional drug frontiers move around, as the value of drug rents in particular areas changes; as state repression's incentives, capabilities and/or effectiveness change over time, increasing the cost of rent capture in particular areas, and decreasing it in others; and as the quality of the self-regulation of local competition over the drug rent gets better over time in some places, and worse in others."
"December 16, 2010","We lack consensus regarding who lawfully may be held in military custody in the contexts that matter most to U.S. national security today - i.e., counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency. More to the point, federal judges lack consensus on this question. They have grappled with it periodically since 2002, and for the past three years have dealt with it continually in connection with the flood of habeas corpus litigation arising out of Guantanamo in the aftermath of the Supreme Court‘s 2008 decision in Boumediene v. Bush. Unfortunately, the resulting detention jurisprudence is shot through with disagreement on points large and small, leaving the precise boundaries of the government‘s detention authority unclear."
"December 15, 2010","Our experimental analysis of alliances in conflicts leads to three main findings. First, even in the absence of repeated interaction, direct contact or communication, free-riding among alliance members is far less pronounced than what would be expected from non-cooperative theory. Second, this possible solidarity among `brothers in arms' when fighting against an outside enemy may rapidly deteriorate or disappear as soon as the outside enemy disappears. Third, when fighting an outside enemy, `brothers in arms' may already anticipate future internal conflict about dividing the spoils of winning; however, this subsequent internal conflict does not discourage alliance members from expending much effort in the contest against the external enemy."
"December 15, 2010","By extensively drawing on existing judicial practice, this chapter argues that the relationship between human rights and the immunities of States and IOs may be conceptualized as a tension among competing rules which can be worked out by means of interpretation, thus as an apparent conflict of norms open to the application of conflict avoidance techniques."
"December 15, 2010","A man sets himself on fire in front of the White House in a dispute with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He has been working as an informant for the FBI in a high-profile terrorism prosecution and is unhappy with the $100,000 he has been paid so far. He has also been recently convicted of bank fraud. As a result, the government declines to call him as a witness, given the damage his actions have on his credibility and trustworthiness. This incident underscores the difficulty inherent in relying on paid informants to drive a prosecution, where material considerations such as money and legal assistance are often the price the government pays for an informant’s services. In the years since September 11, 2001, informants have been at the heart of many major terrorism prosecutions. The entrapment defense, perhaps the only legal tool available to defendants in such prosecutions, has proven ineffective. This is evident when one considers the context of generally heightened suspicion of the Arab and Muslim communities in the United States. Further, a closer look at several of these prosecutions reveals repeated instances of suggestive and provocative activity by informants geared at obtaining a conviction, calling into question whether a genuine threat to U.S. national security actually existed in the first place. This Article argues that the government should cease its current practice of using informants to generate terrorism prosecutions."
"December 14, 2010","Given the growing importance of terrorism in today’s world, it is essential to understand its impact on the global economy. This paper examines the case of Israel to consider the impact of this phenomenon on the nation’s economy. Specifically, it will aim to determine whether the Israeli financial market is sensitive to terror attack, how sensitive are the various sectors of the Israeli financial markets and whether sectors react differently from one another."
"December 14, 2010","Global governance rests on the exercise of public authority by a myriad of actors. In the international order, the more powers and influence these actors acquire, the more their legitimacy proves to be controversial. It is submitted here that the legitimacy of international, regional, and domestic actors that partake in global governance - those considered here as global actors - must be appraised from a two-fold standpoint. Their legitimacy can first be gauged through the lens of the origin of their powers. This is what this Article calls the legitimacy of origin. The origin of the power may often prove an insufficient indicator of an actor’s legitimacy. For this reason, legitimacy is also evaluated in light of the way in which the actor exercises its power. This is what this Article calls the legitimacy of exercise. This Article is based on the assumption that failing to recognize this dual character of legitimacy of actors involved in global and regional governance can undermine any endeavor to grasp the contemporary complexity of the latter."
"December 14, 2010","This article examines the increasingly local impact of gaps in the accountability regime governing the activities of the United Nations. More in particular, the article looks at the accountability deficit of the UN administration of Kosovo in terms of its impact on the local legal order, as designed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999). Part I sets out the main premises which shape the peculiar legal order in Kosovo. Part II goes on to describe how accountability of the United Nations administration is regulated and considers the insufficiencies of the accountability regime. Part III introduces the Human Rights Advisory Panel, a sui generis body established with the aim to improve the accountability record of the United Nations mission in Kosovo. Maine institutional and procedural features are discussed. Finally, Part IV reflects on the strained relationship between the United Nations administration and the Human Rights Advisory Panel and the ultimate demise of the human rights oversight body. The article concludes with some final observations regarding the adverse effects of the described developments, on the ground and with respect to the United Nations in general."
"December 14, 2010","Ethical codes for mediators describe party self-determination as “the fundamental principle of mediation,” regardless of the context within which the mediation is occurring. The definition of self-determination, however, is a matter of dispute. Based on a review of the debate surrounding the promulgation and revision of ethical codes for court-connected mediators in Florida and Minnesota, this Article demonstrates that a vision of self-determination anchored in party-centered empowerment is yielding to a vision that is more reflective of the norms and traditional practices of lawyers and judges, as well as the courts’ strong orientation to efficiency and closure of cases through settlement.  Disputing parties are still responsible for making the final decision regarding settlement, but they are cast in the role of consumers, largely limited to selecting from among the settlement options developed by their attorneys. Indeed, it is the parties’ attorneys, often aided by mediators who are also attorneys, who assume responsibility for actively and directly participating in the mediation process, invoking the substantive (i.e., legal) norms to be applied and creating settlement options."
"December 13, 2010","This article reports findings from an empirical study of Settlement Week mediation in four general civil trial courts.  Nearly all parties and lawyers had favorable assessments of the mediation process, the mediator and, in cases that settled, the agreement. The only mediator qualification that increased the likelihood of settlement was the mediators' level of mediation experience.  The mediators' hours of training, years in law practice, and expertise in the subject matter of the case were not related to settlement.  Although the mediators' recommending a particular resolution increased the likelihood of settlement, it did so at the expense of parties' perceptions of fairness.  Findings regarding the effect of other mediator qualifications and actions on settlement and on participants' assessments are also discussed."
"December 13, 2010","In investor-state arbitration, tribunals can and should apply the English rule on legal costs and abandon the two alternatives, the American rule and the pro-claimant rule.  Under the English rule, the unsuccessful party in a dispute must indemnify the prevailing party for the costs of dispute resolution.  Both doctrine and public policy support the application of the English rule, particularly in light of the much-publicized backlash against the investor-state arbitration system.  Most importantly, the English rule would help to mitigate the two most commonly identified causes of the backlash — the system’s alleged proinvestor bias and its chilling effect on host states’ legitimate use of police power.  Though a slowly growing number of tribunals have either followed or purported to follow the English rule, the doctrine and policies that justify applying it have so far been either poorly articulated or ignored.  This Note presents those justifications in detail for the first time."
"December 13, 2010","The armed conflict in Colombia has left over 3,3 million displaced persons seeking refuge in the cities. Studies on displacement in Colombia have focused on examining the losses that this crime inflicts on the victims, but have made little progress on analyzing its effects on the standard of living of the receiving communities. This study uses impact evaluation techniques to assess the effects of displacement on populations living in strata 1 and 2 areas in Pasto, Nariño. The findings indicate that displacement has mixed effects on the living conditions of the receiving communities. Although there are negative effects in terms of security and food security, there have been positive effects on trust and social infrastructure. This indicates that while the displaced population generates tension in the receiving communities, it also provides solutions to historical social problems, such as lack of education and health infrastructure."

"December 13, 2010","In situations of conflict, decision making procedures often play a highly symbolic role. Inclusive procedures that share decision making power foster cooperation, regardless of the actual decisions that are the outcome of such procedures. This paper develops a formal model of such procedural effects in the context of post-war state-building. I show that the degree to which power is delegated to local authorities increases the occupier's legitimacy because it is a signal of her benevolent motives. This means that delegation increases cooperation with the occupiers, regardless of the actual decisions taken. The model predicts that the strength of the procedural effect depends on the amount of uncertainty, the degree of mutual dependence of occupiers and occupied and the size of the conflict of interest between the occupier and the population."
"December 13, 2010","In this essay, I argue that monist political philosophers such as John Rawls fail to take politics seriously enough. The reason is that they treat it as if it were, or could be, like a game. I begin by showing why we consider games as frivolous and then assert that Rawls’ theory of justice is more than merely analogous to a game, as Rawls himself seems to suggest, but is in fact a kind of game. Conceiving of justice in this way is then shown to be harmful to political practice both as regards the citizens who participate directly in it and those who do no more than follow it. Similar harms, it is then argued, come from taking politics too seriously, which I claim is the attitude of pluralist political philosophers such as Isaiah Berlin. To them, the plural, incommensurable nature of values means that they cannot be reconciled and so that politics must be a matter of negotiating dirty, and often tragic, compromises. What we need instead, I thus conclude, is a third way, one which is neither monist nor pluralist."
"December 13, 2010","In this essay, I argue that just war theory − as advanced, in particular, by Michael Walzer − fails to take war seriously enough. This is because it proposes that we regulate war with systematic rules that are comparable to those of a game. Three types of claims are advanced. The first is phenomenological: that just war theory’s abstract nature interferes with our judgment of what is, and should be, taking place. The second is meta-ethical: that the rules of just war theory are not, in fact, systematic after all, there being inherent contradictions between them. And the third is practical: that by getting people to view war as a game it encourages its “aestheticization” (play being a central mode of the aesthetic) with the result that those who fight wars get encouraged to act in dangerous ways. And war, it goes without saying, is already dangerous enough."
"December 13, 2010","This article reports the findings of empirical studies that examined the effects of mandatory mediation in small claims and general civil cases. The article begins with a discussion of the factors that led to the adoption of mandatory mediation and concerns that have been raised about its use. The studies compared cases that were required to use mediation and cases that voluntarily chose mediation in terms of the outcomes of mediation and party and attorney perceptions of the process, the mediator, and the outcome.  Settlement rates were somewhat lower when mediation was mandatory than when both parties chose to mediate, with intermediate settlement rates when only one party requested mediation.  Among cases that settled, there were no differences in the outcome or in parties' assessments of the agreement or compliance with it.  There were few differences between mandatory and voluntary mediation in parties' perceptions of the mediation process and the mediator."
"December 12, 2010","Arbitration is usually defined as a manner of dispute resolution. While in most legal systems the arbitration agreement is considered a type of procedural agreement, it is more closely connected with substantive law than procedural agreements stricto sensu, i.e. agreements entered into between parties related to particular pending or immediate proceedings with the intention of directing the course thereof. If one accepts the definition of procedural agreement as an agreement that induces its direct effect in the area of procedure, in relation to a certain formal procedure (whatever the kind), i.e. that these agreements are effective in relation to such procedure, such definition is evidently correct and relatively broad and is a definition of procedural agreement in the broad sense. The term procedural agreement so broadly defined can no doubt cover also arbitration and prorogation agreements, as arrangements on the manner of resolving potential disputes arising from substantive legal relations based either on a contract or otherwise (for example within extra-contractual obligations and on jurisdiction of a particular forum/tribunal or the manner of constituting tribunal to hear and to resolve such disputes, as well as other procedural terms relating to the particular procedure. It is an arrangement on a potential [future] procedure (approved and regulated at least in its basic principles by law) in its broadest sense, usually a procedure in the sense of an adversary fact-finding proceeding. Therefore there is no need for such an agreement to be made in respect of one specific proceeding. The basic typical feature of procedural agreement in the above-defined broad sense is its ability to induce effects approved by procedural law, including establishing the jurisdiction of particular forum (tribunal) before which a certain proceeding may be commenced and held. Besides, there is also another type of procedural agreement which I call procedural agreement in the narrow sense (or narrow procedural agreement) and which are entered into only in the course of a particular proceeding. The effects of these agreements are operative solely and exclusively within such particular proceeding or with respect to the subject of the proceeding, whether to the subject in its entirety or partially, when the subject matter scope delimited by the relevant procedural agreement is more narrow than the scope of the subject of the given proceeding. Thus the subject of such procedural agreement in the narrow sense cannot in any situation exceed the scope of the subject of the proceeding. If such situation occurs, it has to be considered according to the relevant applicable law whether such subject matter excess of the procedural agreement brings about some qualified effect (such as invalidity/nulity or simply ineffectiveness of the agreement) in respect of the procedural agreement in its entirety or to the part exceeding the subject of the procedure only. This category of procedural agreements includes for instance reconciliation agreements concluded in the course of proceedings, agreements on withdrawal of action, agreements on withdrawal of a remedy already filed, evidentiary agreements (on types of evidence and manner of taking evidence) etc. It is not only possible but in the author‘s opinion also necessary to apply substantive law to procedural agreements, at least as supportive instruments in questions not regulated by procedural law, the effect of procedural agreements (in any case at least of narrow procedural agreements and as a rare exception possibly also in broad procedural agreements in some countries according to their legal approach under the theory of extensive effect) is limited solely to the area of procedure. For a narrow procedural agreement to be valid and binding for parties, the parties must act within their respective procedural capacities, that is, within their respective procedural personalities. It is an agreement entered into by parties in civil proceedings in which they agree certain procedural legal effects. The subject-matter of the agreement is all relations that are subject to discretionary freedom of the parties in compliance with the law and rules applicable to a given specific proceeding and to the manner and course of the proceeding. In any case the procedural agreements in terms arbitration agreement (arbitration clause) will commonly be evaluated pursuant to substantial law and its institutes, at least in civil law, while in the common law the judges dispose of a broad range of possibilities to evaluate such agreements abstractedly from the substantive law. This close link between arbitration agreements and substantive law arises from the fact that arbitration clauses are entered by the parties before any particular proceedings are initiated, and in most cases, simultaneously with the establishment of a substantive legal relation itself, i.e. a particular contract or legal relation similar in nature, and they are intended to serve as a dispute resolution mechanism in order to settle disputes concerning the main agreement in cases concerning arbitration clauses, or a separate contract in cases of formally separate arbitration agreements. The purpose of the arbitration agreement is purely procedural, i.e. designating the method of dispute resolution for the main agreement."
"December 12, 2010","The Look East policy has emerged as an important foreign policy initiative of India in the post-Cold War period. It was launched in 1991 by the then Narasimha Rao Government with the aim of developing political contacts, increasing economic integration and forging security cooperation with countries of Southeast Asia. The policy marked a shift in India’s perspective of the world, where the strategic and economic importance of Southeast Asia to India’s national interests is being recognised. The second phase, which began in 2003, extends the coverage of the Look East policy from Australia to East Asia, with ASEAN as its core. The new phase, thus, marks a shift in focus from trade to wider economic and security cooperation, political partnerships, physical connectivity through road and rail links. In this paper the evolution of India’s Look East policy and its recent approach are analysed."
"December 12, 2010","Most nation-states in Asia and Africa which gained independence from colonial rulers during the middle of the twentieth century are diverse in their ethnic composition. The efforts of the national governments to politically integrate their constituent units have led to the new wave in the study of political integration. The failure of some nation-states in Africa and the continuing resistance to integration till today by several ethnic groups in the Afro-Asian countries necessitates the re-examination of the various theories. In India various methods were used to integrate more than five hundred princely states and other loosely administered areas. Even though the issue of integration has been largely resolved in the mainland, various radical groups in the Northeastern region still challenge and question the extension of the Indian state and political apparatus. This paper is a historical analysis of the process of integration of various states of Northeast India."

"December 11, 2010","The idea of legal theory as a self-conscious theory for inquiry about law has opened up the framework of observation and participation. It has heightened social responsibility in ways that have been creative and receptive to analogies and metaphors from the developments in modern science. This paper explores some of these dominant borrowed metaphors. It further emphasizes the importance of the wide range of concerns in law technically, as well as the law’s capacity to manage and manipulate space and time implicating such issues as weapons of mass destruction, rights of indigenous people, deforestation, and climate change. By giving the ""Anthropocene"" perspective a self-conscious focus on decision-making, this article explores the challenges and opportunities inherent in legal culture for addressing contemporary global crises."

"December 10, 2010","With the discovery of crude oil and natural gas (ONG) in the Niger Delta in 1956, it was expected that it will usher in the much needed sustainable development in the region. Whereas this did not happen, the activities of the multinational oil companies (MNOCs) operating in the region continued to pollute and degrade the environment so much that it disarticulated the local economy of the people. The unmet expectations coupled with the environmental degradation created frustration that consequently led the people, particularly the youths to vandalize oil pipelines. This paper examined the effects, as well as the causes and manifestations of oil pipeline vandalization in the region and country. The paper went further to discuss three celebrated cases on pipeline vandalization to show its consequences on the local people, and national economy and security. It also points out several lessons and recommends the involvement of the host communities into the oil economy for them to guarantee the safety of oil installations in the country."
"December 10, 2010","This Article examines the intersection – so far under-explored – between the private security and military industry and the emerging framework of global administrative law (“GAL”).  I explore in this Article one aspect of this intersection, namely the use of GAL to create a taxonomy of the industry’s regulatory schemes.  The industry is characterized by a fragmented and decentralized regulatory framework, which has yet to be presented in a complete and orderly fashion.  This Article fills the gap by applying GAL’s methodology to the private security and military industry.  Using the industry as a case study in GAL, I identify (1) international formal administration (the United Nations Working Group on Mercenaries); (2) distributed domestic administration (contract and domestic legislation); (3) hybrid modes of administration (multi-stakeholder initiatives); and (4) private modes of administration (industry associations and codes of conduct).  By emphasizing – but not limiting itself to – hybrid and private modes of administration, this Article describes what is an increasingly complex manifestation of global governance.  Its purpose is to highlight GAL’s potential in understanding and contending with the growth of the private security and military industry."
"December 10, 2010","This article analyzes the reasons why the International Court of Justice chose to significantly narrow the scope of its advisory jurisdiction in its Kosovo opinion and, arguably, missed an opportunity to opine on important questions of international law (in particular, matters of recognition, secession, and self-determination). I argue that the Court's approach was driven by a desire to avoid exacerbating tensions between the two most interested parties, namely Kosovo and Serbia. Although the opinion was overwhelmingly perceived as pro-Kosovo in its immediate aftermath, a more thorough analysis suggests that the Court sought a delicate compromise between the positions of the two entities. By working towards an equitable solution, the Court positioned itself more as a means of dispute settlement than as a legal advisory body. The Court succeeded, in the sense that it created a favorable climate for talks between Belgrade and Pristina, though at the cost of a lost opportunity for the development of international law and some confusion of its contentious and advisory roles."

"December 09, 2010","Complex negotiations between large socio-political groups tend to rely on distributive negotiation. This article explores how the human security approach could be used as the basis for selecting ‘standard objective criteria’ to foster more constructive integrative negotiations between the People’s Alliance for Democracy, also known as ‘Yellow Shirts,’ and the National United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship, or the ‘Red Shirts,’ in Thailand. The complexity of the conflict between the two groups in Thailand and the importance of the outcome make it a good representative case study on how to transcend realist/distributional methods of negotiation and conflict resolution. In conclusion, human security provides an ethical yet flexible framework to guide negotiations between large social movements. Finally, the study develops a tentative Human Security Theory of Integrative Negotiation for sociopolitical conflicts."

"December 06, 2010","The paper focuses on current political and legal discourses within Eritrea’s Opposition which operates outside of Eritrea for lack of democratic space inside the country. This state of affairs of the Opposition has created a legal vacuum which is worsened by the Opposition’s inability to develop acceptable structured central governance which can produce and enforce laws. While this task is admittedly difficult for any diaspora-based political forces, the Opposition which has been characterized by disputations has made it almost impossible. So far the only normative document the opposition developed is one inadequate charter. The problem of legal vacuum is worsened by the opposition’s inability to agree on the 1997 Constitution of Eritrea drafted and adopted under the supervision of the Government of Eritrea. The perils of operating in unregulated political environment being too clear, a part of the opposition has lately resolved to produce in a year a “road-map” which is understood to be a constitution."
"December 06, 2010","The agreements signed between the United States and the Iraqi government in November 2008 and that came into force on 1 January 2009 mark a new phase in the process by which Iraq is to recover its full sovereignty. Being the outcome of a lengthy stand-off between the Bush administration and the Iraqi government, they are intended essentially to organize the withdrawal of US troops, to determine their temporary status on Iraqi soil and to set out guidelines for cooperation on an equal footing between the two states. Taking over from the multinational force whose mandate was extended by the Security Council until 31 December 2008, these agreements are presented as the final step towards restoring Iraq’s “legal status and international standing” to the situation that prevailed before the first sanctions were imposed on it in 1990."

Indeed, the topic of the survival of the State being considered by the Supreme Court as consubstantial to its daily existence since 1948, thousands of judgements based on individual petitions have been delivered attempting to put in balance these two key-values, which are safety and liberty."

The displacement camps that previously hosted up to 90 percent of the population, some for over a decade, have been dismantled and people have returned home. They are rebuilding their houses and cultivating their land. From a devastated and dangerous region with little or no economic activity, northern Uganda is beginning to revive. But recovery from decades of conflict takes time, commitment and resources. Much work remains to reach sustainable peace, to develop the economy and establish essential services. The needs and priorities of the people remain largely unknown. At the same time, the LRA has not disbanded. From its current base in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, it continues to perpetrate serious human rights violations and remains a shadow over the region."

"December 05, 2010","This article examines whether and how the delegation of sovereign regulative powers in the nuclear field by states to supranational regional authorities can further nonproliferation objectives. More precisely, it asks whether the second Rome Treaty, which instituted the European Community of Atomic Energy (Euratom), could serve as a model for the creation of other regional authorities in the nuclear field, particularly among Middle Eastern and Arab nations. It argues that the Euratom Treaty provides interesting technical provisions, particularly regarding 1) safeguards against the diversion of fissile materials by state and non-state actors, 2) confidence-building measures for state actors when they establish R&D in nuclear technologies, and 3) fuel supply assurances for state actors. Building on archival research of the Euratom Treaty negotiations and the Euratom Commission, the article argues that, today, supranational provisions included in the Euratom Treaty would have stronger nonproliferation effects than looser forms of international cooperation. However, the article also points to specific weaknesses in the Euratom Treaty and outlines how legal scholars and diplomats can avoid some of its pitfalls."
"December 05, 2010","This paper opens the analysis of treaties in the security field to sociological and hermeneutic analyses of international lawmaking practices. In a legal world where tensions exist between legal regimes, it claims that the interpretive quality of past treaties determines which legal rules survive and which ones disappear when new treaties with overlapping jurisdiction are introduced. The article demonstrates this thesis by using the dynamics of legal change in the field of nuclear proliferation from 1950 to 1975. It first shows that instrumentalist theories of international law, which see in some aspects of the nonproliferation regime a) attempts by strong states to freeze the status quo, and b) attempts by all state parties to solve coordination and cooperation problems, fail to explain how the global nonproliferation regime was articulated with prior regional regimes, in particular, the transatlantic regime. To explain why discrepancies existed between the two regimes, and why certain rules evaporated, while others survived the paradigm shift, this paper then moves to field and hermeneutic theories of international law. It shows that only by paying attention to the interpretive quality of the constitutive treaties of each regime (whether they are clear, ambiguous, or opaque), can one explain the evolution of the nonproliferation regimes."
"December 05, 2010","A package of economic sanctions has been approved by the U.S. Congress in late June followed by President Obama’s signature, in the hope of pressuring Iran to suspend its nuclear program. The United Nations, for its part, recently imposed a fourth round of sanctions on Iran in an attempt to force it to comply with international demands over its nuclear program. Beneath the surface, however, foreign investment in Iran is already rapidly declining and fleeting like the wind. Even without refined-petroleum sanctions, foreign energy companies are already reducing their investments and some are leaving the country."

The Court did not necessarily clear the way for future human rights litigation against such officials, however, cautioning that such suits ""may still be barred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common law"".  At the same time, the Court provided only minimal guidance as to the content and scope of common law immunity.  Especially striking was the Court’s omission of any mention of the immunity of foreign officials under customary international law (""CIL"")."

Both wars were illegitimate according to the customary international law principles and UN Charter provisions of Security Council authorization, self defence and humanitarian intervention.  Both wars signify ILWAC's relative meakness in comparison to the economic and political aspirations of the world's most powerful nations, who are able to ignore ILWAC provisions for their desired goals."

"December 05, 2010","The Human Rights abuses suffered by detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have dominated many of the cases before the United Kingdom‟s Courts involving detainees. The Human Rights Act 1998, still new to the statute book, loomed large in the detainees‟ arguments. The decisions in these cases, however, often relegate such factors to the background to the case. This article examines why the Courts deciding these cases declined to develop the law of diplomatic protection on the basis of Human Rights concerns, and why such arguments continued to be employed. Furthermore, it assesses why the Courts have shown greater receptiveness to arguments similarly grounded in accusations of inhuman and degrading treatment in relation to later cases involving former detainees challenging the role of the British Government in their detention."
"December 05, 2010","Liberal theory predicts that increased trade interdependence reduces the probability of conflict between states.  In both theoretical and empirical terms, however, the existing literature has addressed these ideas primarily at the dyadic level.  We argue that liberal theory, as well as the research designs for testing its implications, could benefit greatly from taking into account the networked structure of international trade.  Specifically, if trade has a pacifying effect on dyadic relations, then this effect should be observable not only based on dyadic trade levels, but also based on the relative positions of states within the international network of trading states.  We define trading communities as groups of states that are more trade-dependent on each other than they are on states, and use the concept of modularity to measure these communities.  We hypothesize that, regardless of the extent to which they directly trade with each other, states that belong to the same trading community will be less likely to go to war.  We find significant support for this hypothesis and, more generally, for the notion that the fundamental arguments of liberal theory can be extended to extra-dyadic relations."
"December 05, 2010","Following the June 12, 2009 Presidential Election in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the ruling government imposed a crackdown on non-violent protesters, claiming they were ""velvet revolutionaries."" The state used a piece of Islamic criminal law, muharibih (sometimes moharebeh) in order to impose the death penalty. This paper traces the history of muharibih in Shi'i Ja'afari jurisprudence and finds that Iran's use of the law has no basis in traditional Islamic law. Furthermore, Iran's actions may qualify its leaders as perpetrators of muharibih for the way in which they use it. This analysis is suggested as a method by which large human rights organizations may examine the legitimacy of putatively ""Islamic"" governmental actions: rather than avoiding this important, influential and inflammatory topic, human rights organizations must have the temerity to critique the actions of men by the standards and methods those men claim are God's."
"December 05, 2010","After the Second World War, the applications of nuclear science raise a crucial threat to international security as far as their civil applications can be turned into military devices. Debates about nuclear proliferation offer a fruitful site to analyze the production of an expertise in bio-security. This paper analyzes in particular how experts have envisioned the role of nation-states and sovereign power in relation to policies aimed at ensuring the security of populations against the risk of nuclear annihilation. It explores what conceptions of sovereignty different experts constructed; what disciplines (political science, natural science, law) were mobilized in this debate; what strategies of institutionalization American experts followed; what publics were targeted by these experts (officials, think tanks, academic publics, media). Experts’ conceptions of threats and insurances as well as the institutional paths they build to access policy circles explain which of the experts’ policies diffused among policy circles. This approach, which focuses on the production of ideas rather than on the diffusion of administrative norms, complements neo-institutionalist studies of the internationalization of scientific modes of regulation."
"December 04, 2010","In Hirst v. UK (No. 2) the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights found that the Representation of the People Act 1983, breached the right of prisoners to vote under Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Nonetheless, this decision permitted the United Kingdom to reform the disproportionate blanket ban on prisoners voting, rather than requiring the enfranchisement of all prisoners. This article re-examines Hirst, assessing the reasons behind the Grand Chamber’s cautious approach, and the stalled reform process which it set in train. Consultations regarding reform, begun by the previous Labour government, were premised on the understanding that the disenfranchisement of prisoners was a consistent feature of the United Kingdom’s history as a parliamentary democracy. This, the Labour government argued, justified responding to Hirst with very limited proposals and helped to persuade ministers to delay reform. But the history of prisoner disenfranchisement in the United Kingdom is more complicated than Labour’s consultation documents acknowledged. In the aftermath World War II large sections of the prison population were able to vote. With the coalition government in office, a fresh opportunity has arisen to proceed with reform. Parallel developments in Strasbourg jurisprudence, however, will make any effort towards partial enfranchisement of prisoners more difficult. In Frodl v Austria, Strasbourg finally lost patience with the vacillation of countries like the United Kingdom, and sought to impose a broad measure of prisoner enfranchisement."
"December 04, 2010","Law serves as the site through which Canada expresses its commitment to the global war effort, showing its willingness to suspend the rights of citizens and non-citizens alike in the name of national and international security. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, for example, Canada legislated for the internment of individuals with Japanese ancestry, conﬁscated their property, stripped them of citizenship and deported them to Japan, even if they did not have concrete ties to that country. Canadian history has demonstrated that one cannot understand the demarcation between those who are imagined to belong to the community and those who are constructed as ‘foreigners’ simply on the basis of citizenship. Rather, the demarcation has also historically been constructed along racial lines. In times of war, the law speaks loudly and clearly against those who are regarded as undesirable, untrustworthy and foreign."
"December 04, 2010","The assessment of the individual’s right to request diplomatic protection in English law in the Court of Appeal decisions in Abbasi and Al Rawi, involving detainees held in Guantánamo Bay, focused upon whether the Crown’s refusal to make formal representations to the United States Government for the claimants’ release breached their human rights. This article reassesses the dismissal of these claims in light of the correlation between allegiance and protection underpinning the law of treason, and in particular in light of the extended concept of allegiance recognized by the House of Lords in Joyce v DPP. If the British residents who were detained in Guantánamo Bay owed the same degree of allegiance to the Crown as British nationals, the government should have extended diplomatic protection to both groups on an equal basis."
"December 04, 2010","Women’s pain and death blurs the distinction between war and peace. Women are disproportionately starved, attacked physically, emotionally and psychologically, and killed during both war and peace. This paper focuses on the sanctions imposed against Iraq by the United Nations Security Council (“Se- curity Council”) in response to Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the on-going purported threat posed to international peace and security by the Iraqi regime. Intended as a humane alternative to war, the sanctions have nonetheless lead to such high levels of death and suffering, particularly among women and children, that commentators have labeled them “genocide,” a “medieval military siege,” and “a humanitarian disaster comparable to the worst catastrophes of the past decades.”"
"December 04, 2010","This article offers a new interpretation of The Gift written by Marcel Mauss. It provides a contextual interpretation of the formation of Mauss’ thinking about international relations in the question of German reparations paid to the Allies. The article starts by showing the intellectual origins of the concept of “reparations” in the “solidarist” and socialist  movements in which Marcel Mauss, Charles Gide and Léon Blum participated. Then, it shows that Mauss, just before The Gift was first published, argued in favor of granting to Germany a moratorium on its payments of reparations in 1924 and giving back part of their war debt to the Germans. At last, in The Gift, Mauss constructs a normative model of international relations which explains why and how nations honor their debts by circulating gifts which are paid back after some indeterminate amount of time. Thus, The Gift can be conceived as a juridical attempt to establish a legal precedent, especially in German legal culture, that gifts are paid back by counter-gifts, particularly if the rituals and the discontinuous temporality of gift-giving practices are respected."
"December 04, 2010","The principle of self-determination enshrined in Woodrow Wilson’s 14 Points after World War I, generated controversy and resulted in the break-up of empires and states in Europe. An attempt is made to analyze the legal and human rights dimension of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the various processes to resolve the conflicts and dynamics of the Palestinian society characterized by factionalism and gang violence as a result of the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism. The basic question is how to reconcile the seeming demands for access to power, government and territory. This requires compromises on the issues of equality, sovereignty, territorial integrity and recession. These issues are discussed in the context of the Palestinians’ demand for the right of self-determination as most of the territories of Palestine are under Israeli occupation. In 1947, Palestine was partitioned into the Jewish state of Israel and the Arab state of Palestine which resulted in several wars between the Jewish state of Israel and Palestine. So far the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has not been resolved. There are many hurdles and obstacles in the way of resolving the conflict through negotiations for peace and stability in the Middle East. The US foreign policy under various Presidents and their diplomatic initiative for dialogue for peaceful negotiation has been examined."
"December 04, 2010","The Euratom Treaty could interest Middle Eastern states. If states use the Euratom Treaty as a point of departure, and address some of its important loopholes, they could create the conditions for the sustainable and peaceful growth of nuclear power in the region without the risk of nuclear proliferation. But to do so, significant changes must be brought to the Euratom treaty. Here, I present the draft treaty that would result from the alterations I propose to make to the Euratom Treaty. As I drafted this template, I had three main objectives in mind. The first objective: to strengthen the nonproliferation aspects of the Euratom Treaty. The second objective: to strengthen the supranational aspects of the Euratom Treaty. In the Euratom Treaty, only the system of safeguards and controls on nuclear fuels is compulsory. Unfortunately, other interesting mechanisms are optional. Two such examples are the European fuel supply agency and the legal framework of Community enterprises. In the proposed Treaty, these two mechanisms would be compulsory. These two mechanisms, if made compulsory, would mean that access to nuclear fuels by trade would go through a central Community Supply Agency; and that access to nuclear fuels and other fissionable materials by production would also be made through a central Community enterprise, like a common uranium enrichment plant and a common fuel fabrication plant. This means that both the import of nuclear fuels, as well as the front-end and backend of the nuclear fuel cycle will be controlled jointly by the Member-States acting as part of this new Community. The third objective: to strengthen the democratic rule of law created at the supranational level by the Euratom Treaty. This proposal is introduced in a forward by Hans Blix."
"December 03, 2010","This Note, based primarily on interviews with ingando participants, government officials, journalists, and genocide survivors conducted in Rwanda in January 2004, evaluates the merits and limits of government-run ingando solidarity camps as a means of fostering reconciliation in the complicated social landscape of post-genocide Rwanda. Focusing on ingando for ex-combatants, ex-soldiers, students, and released genocidaires, this Note argues that much of the ingando project is focused on the dissemination of pro-RPF ideology, a dangerous undertaking in a country in which political indoctrination and government-controlled information were essential in sparking and sustaining the genocide. Furthermore, a successful reconciliation program must take place in a society that values human rights; therefore, we cannot evaluate ingando in isolation from human rights developments in Rwanda. This Note argues that ingando will fail as a reconciliation mechanism so long as the Rwandan government continues to attack public spheres of independent thought and criticism."
"December 03, 2010","Radical Islam hides behind the curtain of religion, calling forth passages of the Quran to do two things: justify its actions of destruction and call to the hearts of Muslims to join in the ""fight"" to defeat the persecution of Islam worldwide. One cannot argue whether the dogma of a specific religion is artificial or reality. Religion holds specific meaning to each individual and is a part of one's culture and ethnic identity. But, one can argue that when organizations utilize dogma of a religion, or several religions, to justify and further their political or ideological agenda to further the betterment of the organization, then the dogma is false because the dogma would not follow the original religious intent, but the intent of definition based upon the goals of the organization. Therefore, under this explanation, radical Islamic ideology is false dogma."

"December 03, 2010","This chapter critically examines the principle of proportionality under international humanitarian law and contextualizes its vulnerabilities by looking at Israel’s actions during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip between December 27, 2008, and January 18, 2009. It begins by providing a black letter law overview of the principle. Although widely accepted, the proportionality principle suffers from significant shortcomings that impact its usefulness as a predictable tool for distinguishing between the lawful and the unlawful, particularly in the context of asymmetrical warfare. These shortcomings exist at both a theoretical level, in the abstract, and at a practical level. To focus these discussions, the second half of this chapter looks at the largely negative international reaction to Israel’s actions during Operation Cast Lead. This reaction, which was, and has been, typically couched with a feigned certainty that belies and leaves unanswered the theoretical shortcomings of the principle of proportionality, suggests that, more often than not, proportionality acts as the ultimate exemplar of law used instrumentally, as a tool to further a particular politics and paradigm of power."
"December 02, 2010","This paper's aim is to analyze the unfoldings of the human rights paradoxes in Brazi. In this sense is necessary to think of a center and a periphery in a global scale.   Other than meaning an inequality, this reality will be treated like a distinctive unit that allows for the existence of a center in a periphery and vice-versa. It won’t be denied that society lives in a permanent state of disdifferentiation. The meaning of human rights is therefore affected by communicational noises depending on the point of view of the observer (center/periphery).Thus, to verify if there are other forms of breaking the paradox of human rights in Brazil into smaller pieces, one cannot but pay attention to the existence of several centers (policontextuality) of normative production, including human rights."
"December 02, 2010","This book examines the interplay of two sets of policies: the Chinese government’s policies to its borderlands and international relations. It proposes a conceptual framework and argues that China’s policymakers fail to make complete use of the opportunities in the borderlands for accomplishing foreign policymakers’ agenda to strengthen China’s relations with other countries, neighboring ones in particular. As a result, these foreign policies reflect the political elites’ inadequate consideration of the negative impact of these policies on the borderlands, and underscore their worry for territorial disintegration. Therefore these policies center on the pursuit of central control through exercising administrative-military coercion, making the borderlands economically dependent, standardizing the cultural identity, and indoctrinating CCP-defined ideology. The challenges of the borderlands to the national integration are exaggerated so much that political elites pursued control and standardization at the expense of the identification of many people in borderlands with the regime, China’s international image and the relations with its neighbouring countries."

"December 02, 2010","This article considers and questions the ways in which grand schemes of rights infringement such as extraordinary rendition can translate into specific but also corrosive questions of accommodation in the law of evidence. This article enables us to see the extents to which questions considered to be either ‘grand’ or ‘minor’ in the context of counter-terrorism and human rights protections are, in fact, inter-connected. The article focuses on the use of information obtained from detainees who were subjected to extraordinary rendition. The article examines how the information obtained during these periods of extraordinary rendition might be used in any subsequent criminal prosecutions of the detainees. The article explores the rules in both U.S. Federal Court and the Military Commissions which govern the admissibility of evidence obtained during extraordinary renditions and questions whether evidence obtained under this practice should be admissible in any subsequent prosecutions of the detainees. The paper examines the likely corrosive impact that the use of this evidence could have on fundamental due process protections and concludes that while the admissibility of this evidence is problematic in any forum, trying these suspects in federal court is the best option available."

"November 30, 2010","One under-researched dimension of conflict in Aceh is the relationship between the ethnic Acehnese majority and the province's various ethnic minority groups, such as Gayo, Alas, Kluet and Singkil. This relationship has recently come to the forefront of politics in Aceh, due to the emergence of two movements advocating for the partition of Aceh and the creation of two new provinces, Aceh Leuser Antara (ALA) in the central Aceh highlands and Aceh Barat Selatan (ABAS) along the southwest coast. This development is seen by many observers as one of the greatest challenges to peace and stability in Aceh. While Indonesian law provides for the creation of new provinces, the establishment of ALA and ABAS would contradict the peace process, which is based on the premise of a single territory."
"November 30, 2010","The invasion and occupation of Iraq has attracted significant legal interest. A year after Coalition forces invaded Iraq, debate over the legality of that use of force shows no sign of abating."
"November 30, 2010","The recent invasion and occupation of Iraq focused attention on a host of international law issues. Many fall within the ambit of the laws and customs of war, a subset of public international law which has distinct components: the jus ad bellum (the right to resort to the use of force); and the jus in bello (rules which apply during armed conflict). This paper explores a law of war issue that has been debated for centuries: whether and in what circumstances local inhabitants may wage war against foreign occupation. While a strict separation is maintained between the two components of the laws of war, resolution of the issue under discussion necessarily involves recourse to both.  The present contribution does not offer an exhaustive contribution to the subject.  Instead it focuses on the historical development of the norms of lawful belligerency and the law of occupation. Particular attention is paid to Palestinian lawyer and scholar Karma Nabulsi's study on the impact of three 19th century traditions of war upon the development of the laws of war and occupation. Her contentious and important thesis is critiqued in the context of a broader discussion of the following questions: Was civilian participation in armed resistance to enemy occupation of the homeland a recognized norm of 19th century customary law? If so, has this norm survived the codification of the laws of war?"
"November 30, 2010","Human rights are understood as rights which belong to any individual as a consequence of being human, independently of acts of law.  Human rights alone do not ensure effective enjoyment of human rights. They must be included in a network of institutions which are guided by the same philosophy. Human rights of the third generation are highly complex composite rights like the right to development, the right to peace, and the right to a clean environment. None of these rights has solid legal foundations in a legal instrument of worldwide applicability. It is certainly say that, there will be many attempts in the future to use unorthodox strategies with a view to enforcing rights which are not capable of being enforced in the country of origin.  It is, of course, much easier to guarantee human rights if the basic societal framework corresponds fully to the requirements of democracy and the rule of law."
"November 30, 2010","As a site of tremendous social, political and economic transformation over the past decade, Indonesia’s northwestern-most province of Aceh on the island of Sumatra has attracted considerable attention. Aceh has been the scene of one of the most catastrophic natural disasters and large-scale reconstruction efforts in human history following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and undersea earthquake. It has also been the site of one of Asia’s most protracted armed separatist conflicts, as well as a uniquely successful case study on the global map of conflict resolution. Since 2005, when an internationally mediated peace process in Helsinki led to resolution of the Aceh conflict, the province has become the subject of Indonesia’s biggest experiment with democratic decentralization via the conferral in 2006 of 'self-government' to Aceh within Indonesia. In conducting research about Aceh, many scholars use the provincial capital of Banda Aceh as a base, not least because of the city’s historical and contemporary relevance as a centre of important events and moments of transformation. Yet to date, little attention has been paid to Banda Aceh itself as the primary unit of analysis. Scholars and policy-makers alike have tended to take Aceh in its entirety as their sub-national subject of study.In this paper we provide a Banda Aceh-centered analysis of transformations within and about Aceh since 1998. This is done by tracing the changing position of the city, provincially, nationally and internationally, as well as internally in its relations with other (mostly rural) parts of Aceh. The focus is on the role that Banda Aceh has played - and continues to play - in the political, economic and social remaking of Aceh. The central conclusion of the analysis is that by re-centering our lens of inquiry onto the provincial capital of Banda Aceh we can gain new insights into a period of tremendous flux and instability in Aceh, not only in terms of the province’s often strained interactions with 'outsiders', but also in the largely overlooked urban-rural cleavages and interrelations between the Acehnese themselves."

The political and military leaders will be held accountable for planning, preparing, initiating or waging illegal wars. After discussing each of the three components identified in the definition of the crime of aggression, the state/collective act of aggression, the link between the individual leader and the state/collective act, and the jurisdictional trigger, this paper then focuses on the significance of the crime of aggression for Jus ad Bellum."

"November 27, 2010","Transitional Justice, Judicial Accountability and the Rule of Law addresses the importance of judicial accountability in transitional justice processes. Despite a general consensus that the judiciary plays an important role in contemporary governance, accountability for the judicial role in formerly authoritarian societies remains largely elided and under-researched. I argue in this book that the purview of transitional justice mechanisms should, as a matter of policy, be extended to scrutiny of the judicial role in the past. Through a critical comparative approach that cuts through the transitioning experiences of post-authoritarian and post-conflict polities in Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa, the book focuses specifically on Nigeria. It demonstrates that public accountability of the judiciary through the mechanism of a truth-seeking process is a necessary component in securing comprehensive accountability for the judicial role in the past. Transitional Justice, Judicial Accountability and the Rule of Law further shows that an across-the-board transformation of state institutions – an important aspiration of transitional processes – is virtually impossible without incorporating the third branch of government, the judiciary, into the accountability process."
"November 26, 2010","What is terrorism to some people may be liberation struggle to others. The goal of violent terror activities is to achieve  sociopolitical goals, not personal objectives. Societal respect is likely to be conferred on those who take up violence as a means to achieve societal goals. Withdrawal of societal respect may deter terrorist recruitment. Such withdrawal of respect is possible if the society has an alternative route to achieve its goals. There are historical evidences of non-violent civic resistance and ’soft power– driven civic action programs addressing political grievances, but there is no known effort to use non-violence to prevent terrorist recruitment. One possible reason for this may be that terrorist recruitment happens surreptitiously and it is difficult to assess who are likely to be recruitment targets or are willing to be recruited. If certain sections of the population are assessed to be vulnerable, authorities in power resort to detention, interrogation, and torture tactics, which are known to further alienate and motivate joining terrorist outfits. This paper shall probe the possibility of using social marketing to promote nonviolence as a means of achieving sociopolitical goals. An analytical review of literature shall assess the appropriateness of social marketing in encouraging adoption of non-violent strategies to resolve grievances. A roadmap for future empirical and action research is the expected outcome of the paper. The paper is expected to provide an alternative to violent Governmental retaliation to terrorism and consequently contribute to the understanding of public policy issues related to terrorism. No systematic use of social marketing principles has been used to deter terrorist recruitment so far and the paper shall address this gap in literature."
"November 26, 2010","Is there a link between decentralized governance and conflict prevention? This article tries to answer the question by presenting the state of the art of the intersection of both concepts. Provided that social conflict is inevitable and given the appearance of new threats and types of violence, as well as new demands for security based on people (human security), our societies should focus on promoting peaceful changes."
"November 26, 2010","In protracted refugee situations, basic needs are increasingly deﬁcient as humanitarian relief decreases over time. In response to unmet needs, refugees often seek opportunities for income generation to meet their basic needs. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the desires and concerns of refugee populations surviving without adequate aid in order to explore risks associated with income-generating activities and the possibilities for livelihood support. The case study focused on the Rohingya refugees, an ethnic Muslim minority from Myanmar, residing in southern Bangladesh. This study, based on 127 interviews, showed that although there is no legal right to work for refugees in Bangladesh, nearly every refugee household was engaged in multiple forms of wage-earning employment as a coping mechanism to economic deprivations."
"November 26, 2010","The Australia-UK taxation treaty dating from 1967, and now succeeded by the 2003 convention, was one of the UK’s older extant conventions and Australia’s oldest. It had been badly in need of updating for some time. It is particularly interesting to discern what features of the 2003 treaty have been influenced by the opportunity which both countries have had to focus on their treaty policy as a result of recent negotiations with the US – the UK in terms of its new treaty with the US and Australia in its recent Protocol which was the first outcome in the development of its new treaty policy."
"November 26, 2010","The study takes a procedural and comparative perspective on the normative role and legal status of the Prosecutor in the trial stage of international criminal proceedings. Measuring the nature and scope of the prosecutorial powers at trial is facilitated by resort to a binary conceptual framework. On the one hand, the international Prosecutors may be situated on the scale between the 'minister of justice' and 'partisan advocate' ideals. His core function being a 'minister of justice', the Prosecutor enjoys fair trial collaterally to the respective rights of the accused. He has no identifiable clients and represents the abstract 'interests of justice' held equally by the international community as a whole and by the accused himself, rather than solely or especially by victims. On the other hand, the degree of the Prosecutor's procedural autonomy and discretion in formulating and presenting the case should be juxtaposed with the ambit of judicial competence to control trial. To varying degrees in different international and hybrid criminal jurisdictions, the extent of the latter competence precludes regarding the Prosecutor as a true dominus litis at trial. Through the lenses of this framework, the international Prosecutor's function is overviewed with respect to all milestones of the trial stage, from the preparation for trial to sentencing."
"November 26, 2010","The relationship between the United States and the International Criminal Court (ICC or Court) has recently come full circle. The United States has transitioned from being an ICC supporter to opponent and back again at full steam. In the past year the United States has praised the Court’s efforts, chastised those states that have failed to cooperate with it, and offered unsolicited assistance to the ICC Prosecutor. This very public policy of principled engagement leaves little doubt that the United States and the ICC are moving closer together. It has likewise resurrected the question of whether the United States will ultimately join the Court. This is the issue that this Article comprehensively addresses. This Article first critiques the changing U.S. approach toward the Court, isolating those aspects central to prior U.S. opposition to the ICC. It then assesses the relevance of these concerns in light of the Court’s work to date. This Article also considers the outcome of the 2010 ICC Review Conference. It analyzes the amendments made to the Court’s Statute regarding the controversial crime of aggression and explains why these new provisions are not likely to impede U.S ratification. As its final area of inquiry, this Article examines the early work of the ICC in order to determine whether the institution is in fact fulfilling its mission to act as a “court of last resort.”  Determining that the ICC’s present approach to case admissibility neither provides evidence that the Court is on a path that assures its anti-impunity goal nor comports with the U.S. preference to see justice performed at the national level, this Article concludes by noting the changes that will have to be made before U.S. accession can become a possibility."
"November 25, 2010","A reset of relations between academia and the US security community is needed to manage an increasingly dangerous international order.  Concerns about Pentagon co-optation of academia pale in comparison to continued reliance on a loosely associated collection of DoD, the intelligence community, Congressional staffers, contractors, and Washington based think tanks for strategic thinking.  Few have noticed how the intellectual base of US defense and security thinking has concentrated geographically to inside the Washington beltway.  In contrast, the analytical structures of thought leadership in World War II and the Cold War had a much broader intellectual base, drawing from wider segments of American life."
"November 24, 2010","Refugee protection decisions engage migrants’ fundamental life, liberty and security of the person interests. As a result, refugee protection claimants enjoy institutional and procedural rights under conventional international law. These include the right to a fair adjudication of their protection claims by an independent tribunal. To be independent, a tribunal must meet the formal guarantees of security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence and must actually be independent, in appearance and practice, from the executive and legislature, particularly in the appointments process. Refugee protection decisions must be made by first instance adjudicative bodies that either fully comply with the requirements of tribunal independence or whose decisions are subject to subsequent review by a tribunal that meets these requirements and has sufficient jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute. The Canadian refugee protection system fails, in certain respects, to meet international standards of independence.  The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board’s Refugee Protection Division enjoys statutory, objective badges of independence and appears to operate independently of the executive. However, the independence of Canadian officials engaged in eligibility determinations and in pre-removal risk assessments is very much in question because they have a closer relationship to executive law enforcement functions."
"November 23, 2010","Twenty years ago, the successes in East Germany led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9th of November 1989 and, a short time later, to the reunification of Germany on 3rd of October 1990. In the beginning, the process of the German reunification was seen very optimistically, but with the passage of time, this view was changing, and today many analysts speak about the ‘German Messogiorno’ in order to compare the eastern part of Germany with the underdeveloped poor south of Italy. But in the international context also the whole Germany underwent strong changes, among them in the western regions the crisis of the traditional industrial sector and increasing structural problems as the unemployment. So, additionally to the difficult constellation resulting from the reunification for the internal situation of Germany, came the new international reality characterized by a decreasing rate of the industrial production in all the old industrial nations as a global phenomenon, accompanied by a process of deregulation which for East Germany implied the ‘privatization of all the society’. In this way, in Germany very deep social changes occurred and are occurring, that have no comparison neither with any other important western country nor, in the case of the ex German Democratic Republic, with any eastern country. Therefore, no doubts should exist about the necessity of an evaluation of the process of the unification of Germany, the first European power and motor of the European integration. The present article undertakes a partial diagnosis of the new German reality at the beginning of the XXI century."
"November 23, 2010","The conflicting relationship between peace and justice is frequently debated in the field of transitional justice. The obligation to prosecute serious crimes can contradict the measures necessary to reestablish peace among society. The predicament gives rise to a similar, though less obvious, challenge in many developing countries, where the formal justice system can be at odds with conflict management initiatives. Often, due to their inaccessibility or incompatibility with local socio-cultural norms, official justice institutions in developing countries do not fully penetrate the whole of society. In response, conflict management and peacebuilding initiatives have proven to be more flexible and responsive to socio-political realities. While such initiatives may be more efficient in reestablishing the peace between communities in conflict, they may contradict the official law."

"November 22, 2010","Greeted with the exceptionally high expectation that it would usher in a new era in US-Africa policy, the Obama administrations first year in office promises greater continuity, as opposed to sea change to Bush era Africa policy. Apart from a slight change in rhetoric and tone, little points to substantive change in US relations to Africa. Given the Bush era’s noteworthy contributions to public health and democracy promotion, building upon the status quo is not entirely amiss for the Obama administration. Yet, if the Obama administration is to stake a claim in history for its approach to Africa-substantive improvements to US security engagement with Africa, partnership with emerging powers on the African continent and innovations to US involvement with public health on the continent will be crucial."

The decision to make a second explosion and to continue launching medium range rockets to the Pacific meant new sanctions to her form the Security Council in July. However, the imminence of a war does not appear a realistic scene, since the multilateral decision reflects the agreement of the great powers in taking care of the situation of that country, preventing her of the possession of the atomic capability, but without aggravating the situation of her population, threatened by the ghosts of hunger and power deficiency. The new valuation of the problem on the part of important external agents as the United States and Japan give foot to think that they will look for to calm the tension in the zone, supported in the Dialogue of 6 parts mechanism, that has come supporting Chinese government."
"November 22, 2010","Obama’s rise to power undoubtedly represented a profound change with regard to the existent international policies deployed by President George W Bush and his doctrine on Preventive War. From a long-term perspective, this might also mean a turn towards idealism after a long period of predominant realism, which was intensively conducted during the Cold War by means of the Containment Doctrine. Prevalent diplomacy together with restoration of respect for civil rights at the core of all international relations would effectively move idealism-wise. On the contrary, keeping a military-solution scheme within the wars being currently waged by The United States and the consolidation of a global-scope strategic method reinforce a realistic perspective. These are some of the reasons that make President Obama appear to represent a gradual turn in which the idealistic vision mixes, pragmatism involved, with the Containment doctrine, this time not having a global enemy to fight."
"November 22, 2010","This article analyses the different initiatives that Africa has developed with regard to conflict resolution and peace consolidation from a Human Security perspective. In the first part, the article underlines the components of Human Security and the insecurity factors that endanger the lives of individuals in the continent, and then examines the advances in the legal framework of the African Union on in terms of conflict prevention with an emphasis in the security of individuals. The second part is a study of the measures framed within a Human Security perspective for the African states and the international community for an effective protection of individuals, while the actors of a given conflict negotiate and cease hostilities. Finally, the text concludes that Africa recognizes that the security of its citizens is viable while it understands that it is a shared responsibility of the whole continent, in which the individual plays a central role."
"November 22, 2010","This 1987 article in the critical theory journal Telos examined the counterinsurgency carried out in Guatemala during the late 1970s and 1980s by the Guatemalan army and security forces, and the country's transition to civilian democracy in 1986 under the presidency of Vinicio Cerezo.  The article, as an exercise in radical sociology of the Left, argues sharply that the transition is little more than the appearance of democracy, while beneath lies a ""permanent counterinsurgency"" and authoritarian control by the army.  Based on extensive interviews by the authors with many actors in Guatemala, including leading military officers, it offers an inside look at how the Guatemalan military leadership conceived its extensive and brutal counterinsurgency campaign, particularly by comparison to other conflicts in Central America at the time - El Salvador and Nicaragua in particular."
"November 21, 2010","Forced displacement is one of the major humanitarian problems in Colombia. It is a deliberate tactic used by paramilitary groups and guerrillas to drive individuals and entire communities from their home and land in order to use their areas for their own profit. People also abandon their homes out of fear of getting caught in the crossfire, to escape being blackmailed or kidnapped (including forced recruitment), or in frustration with the lack of opportunities. The following paper will explore the forms typically taken by humanitarian agencies that focus on internally displaced people (IDP) as their object of knowledge, assistance, and management. Following on Malkii (1996) and Zetter’s (2007) work about humanitarian interventions and labeling, I argue that the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ representation of Colombian indigenous people who have been labelled as IDP’s tends to silence them."
"November 20, 2010","In this paper we focus on a neglected aspect of common pool resource problems – whether or not actors in a group can find a solution to the underlying coordination issue. Using a simple networked model of coordination we demonstrate that coordination problems are very difficult to solve when there are few solutions and actors possess local information. However, if the number of solutions does not change, then increases in the number of connections in the network can make coordination more likely to occur. These results suggest connections can influence the ability to reach solutions in two different ways. First, if connections reduce the number of solutions to a problem, then coordination may be less likely. Second, if it is possible to build connections between actors without reducing the number of solutions, then these connections facilitate coordination. These insights can help shed light on how institutions may facilitate international policy coordination."

Although the riot was triggered by a labour dispute, it was the first sign of political awakening in the colony's Black community. It was the first in a series of tremors along the fault line that divided the rich White from the poorer Black Bahamians, and was arguably the start of a political movement that eventually led to majority rule and independence."
"November 19, 2010","In August of 2000, the Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations (the “Brahimi Report”) considered the issue of transitional civil administration as an element of United Nations field operations. The Brahimi Report recommended the creation of an interim legal code as part of a U.N. justice package so that any future UN transitional administrations would be able to address the issue of “applicable law” in the early stages of its mission. Using the experience of the United National Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) as a case study, this article establishes how and why a complete model criminal code for transitional governance would have assisted UNTAET. Providing evidence that a model code would have fostered respect for the rule of law, protected particularly vulnerable segments of the post-conflict population and saved the UN from the embarrassment of running afoul of the international human rights standards it helped to establish, this article contends that a model criminal code would serve as an essential tool for future transitional administrations."
"November 19, 2010","This meta-analysis focuses on t-values in studies on the empirical relationship between international economics and international politics. We find that this relationship is highly significant especially regarding import flows. We speculate that an increase in the level of international conflict could thus result alongside the 2009 world trade collapse. The empirical regularity that lower levels of bilateral trade are associated with higher levels of conflict between nations is an important argument for the industrialized world to increase the international economic relationships with China and other emerging economies."

"November 17, 2010","This paper investigates the determinants of intra-household time allocation in post-war Rwanda. A decade after the 1994 genocide, Rwanda still bears the demographic impact of the war, in which at least 800,000 people died and the majority of casualties were adult males. The paper explores two unique features: exogenous variation in household types and large variation in regional cohort-specific sex ratios. Results indicate that, first, exposure to violence and male death can be a trigger of change in gender roles. Second, there is little flexibility to negotiate responsibilities within the household. Third, the local marriage market impacts the division of labor. Young, unmarried women engage more intensely in typical female activities when the shortage of men is severe.

"November 16, 2010","This article examines the crucial, but largely unexamined, question of whether the CIA’s destruction of interrogation tapes depicting the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah violated the federal records laws and assesses the CIA’s troubling, but largely ignored, public assertion that the tapes were not federal records at all. While the press has focused primarily on the narrow issue of whether the tapes were relevant to specific cases or investigations – such as the 9/11 Commission, the Guantanamo detainee cases, or the Moussaoui trial – the federal records laws would have required the preservation of the tapes regardless of their relevance to such proceedings. Morever, the recently completed criminal investigation focused solely on criminal violations rather than on the CIA's institutional compliance with the federal records laws, which is relevant not only to these tapes but the CIA's ongoing obligation to preserve records of its intelligence operations. The article concludes that the CIA should have considered the interrogation tapes records and argues for modest amendments to the federal records laws designed to ensure that the records preservation responsibilities of the intelligence community are sufficiently clear and transparent and that the oversight and enforcement powers of the National Archives and Records Administration are sufficiently robust."

Critiques the relevant Israeli Supreme Court decision. Argues that the war on terror metaphor has failed, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars."
"November 14, 2010","The social sciences investigate human and social dynamics and organization at all levels of analysis (consilience), including cognition, decision making, behavior, groups, organizations, societies, and the world system. Computational social science is the integrated, interdisciplinary pursuit of social inquiry with emphasis on information processing and through the medium of advanced computation. Themain computational social science areas are automated information extraction systems, social network analysis, social geographic information systems (GIS), complexity modeling, and social simulation models. Just like Galileo exploited the telescope as the key instrument for observing and gaining a deeper and empirically truthful understanding of the physical universe, computational social scientists are learning to exploit the advanced and increasingly powerful instruments of computation to see beyond the visible spectrum of more traditional disciplinary analyses."
"November 14, 2010","When Plato observed that “only the dead have seen the end of war,” the Greek philosopher seemed to have seen modern Africa from a distance. Conflicts have become so regular in Africa that they almost constitute a pattern. The roots of African conflicts are many and diverse but very few are as strong as ethnicity. It is a very powerful force that has been harnessed negatively by lords of impunity to deform Africa. Max Weber defined an ethnic group as those human beings or groups that entertain a subjective belief in their common descent because of migration or colonization in such a way that this belief is important for the continuance of non-kinship communal relationship. The politics of identity and ethnicity will remain a fundamental characteristic of the Kenyan democracy."
"November 14, 2010","We consider a situation where groups negotiate over the allocation of a surplus (which is used to fund group specific goods). Each group is composed of agents who have differing valuations for public goods. Members choose a representative to take decisions on their behalf. Specifically, representatives can decide to enter either a (cooperative) negotiation protocol or a conflict to appropriate the surplus. In the cooperative negotiations, disagreement corresponds to a pro rata allocation (as a function of the size of the groups). We analyse the conditions (on the internal composition of the groups) under which conflict will be preferred to negotiated agreements (and vice versa), and we derive welfare implications. Finally, we provide results of comparative statics that highlight the influence of changes in the internal composition of groups and in their relative size on the profitability of negotiated agreements."
"November 14, 2010","Using a unique panel dataset, we estimate the impact of the military base realignments and closures (BRACs) in Germany on the intensity of criminal activity surrounding the base. We use a fixed-effect model to account for time-invariant unobservables in our panel of 298 military bases for the period 2003-2007. We also take advantage of geographic information system software to mitigate estimation issues arising from the spatial nature of the dataset. Estimation results are presented for total crime and four other subcategories: breaking and entering, automobile-related crime, violent crime, and drug-related crime. The estimates indicate that there is no effect of BRACs on criminal activity surrounding the base. We also confirm existing findings in the literature"
"November 14, 2010","Social simulation models from computational social science are beginning to provide significant advances in terms of implementing more complex social, human, and natural dynamics that are characteristic of how countries operate in the real world. In particular, increasingly realistic agent-based models can improve capacity for early warning, understanding, and prediction. The MASON RebeLand model presents three innovations over earlier models: (i) an explicit polity model with politically complete structure and processes; (ii) social and natural model components within an integrated socio-natural system; and (iii) generative dynamics where insurgency and the state of the polity (stable, unstable, failing, failed, and recovering) occur as emergent phenomena under a range of social and environmental conditions. Three scenarios are demonstrated, showing stable, unstable, and failing polity conditions. The MASON computational system for agent-based and network modeling also permits additional experiments and extensions."
"November 14, 2010","This article’s main proposition is that women who seek asylum in the United States based on gender do not have sufficient protection. It first discusses the evolution of gender in asylum law and the growing Northern and Southern dichotomy. This includes a discussion of the specific legal protections of refugees and asylees within the UN Refugee Convention and the relatively recent introduction of gender-based asylum in general. The core of this article is the detailed case discussion of female asylum seekers, particularly from Somalia, but also from Cameroon, Eritrea and Iraq. These female asylum seekers’ claims were augmented by their gender in some aspect and their claims were generally accepted. This article discusses how their legal arguments were raised, the context and the outcome. Within each case discussion, the woman’s rights conditions in the respective country are discussed both at the time her case was filed and contemporaneously."
"November 14, 2010","Most studies of truth commissions assert their positive role in improving human rights. A first wave of research made these claims based on qualitative analysis of a single truth commission or a small number of cases. Thirty years of experience with truth commissions and dozens of examples allow cross-national statistical studies to assess these findings. Two recent studies undertake that project. Their findings, which are summarized in this article, challenge the prevailing view that truth commissions foster human rights, showing instead that commissions, when used alone, tend to have a negative impact on human rights. Truth commissions have a positive impact, however, when used in combination with trials and amnesties. This article extends the question of whether truth commissions improve human rights to how, when and why they succeed or fail in doing so. It presents a ‘justice balance’ explanation, whereby commissions, incapable of promoting stability and accountability on their own, contribute to human rights improvements when they complement and enhance amnesties and prosecutions. The article draws on experiences in Brazil, Chile, Nepal, South Korea and South Africa to illustrate the central argument."

While the Khmer Rouge’s barbarous reign of terror is widely recognized as among the worst human rights tragedies of the 20th Century, as a formal legal matter, it is not clear that what occurred in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 was “genocide.”   The jurisprudence of genocide is unsettled, uncertain, and in flux; and the future trajectory of genocide jurisprudence will be greatly influenced by the ECCC’s disposition in Case 002."

"November 11, 2010","The First World War is generally viewed by both advocates and critics of liberal theory as the quintessential example of a failure of economic integration to maintain international peace. This unanimity belies the fact that the war had its origins in the least integrated portion of Europe (i.e., the Balkans), and only later migrated westward through a complex set of alliance commitments. Crises among the interdependent states ofWestern Europe in the decades leading up to World War I were generally resolved without bloodshed, while conflicts in the autarkic East regularly escalated to militarized violence. Had globalization pervaded Eastern Europe, or the West been less locked into events in the East, Europe might have avoided the “Great War.”"
"November 11, 2010","This article tells the little known story of Herbert Wechsler’s leading role as the government attorney in charge of litigating Korematsu v. United States before the Supreme Court in 1944. His service as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the War Division concluded, Wechsler returned to Columbia Law School after the war and sought on several occasions to justify his role in the Japanese-American internment. Wechsler’s wartime experience helped to shape his thinking as the most important constitutional theorist of postwar America and paved the way for certain key assumptions of the legal process school. These assumptions include: (1) the idea that a ""separation of functions"" is the best available mechanism in our constitutional democracy for dealing with irreconciliable differences in world view and political judgment; (2) the subordination of constitutional liberties to the discretionary power of government; and (3) the belief that legal reasoning is legitimized and ennobled through strict adherence to neutral principles. In contrast to scholars who have portrayed these tenets of the legal process school as outgrowths of the Cold War environment, we suggest that Wechsler’s fundamental legal convictions were (already) formed in the cauldron of the Second World War. The story of Wechsler and legal process after the war is, in significant measure, the story of a transformation of emergency law into peacetime jurisprudence."
"November 11, 2010","This essay addresses several points made during a presentation at the Sutton Colloquium at the University of Denver College of Law on November 6, 2010 concerning the permissibility of use of responsive force in self-defense either in the context of war or outside of a relevant armed conflict when non-state actors such as members of al Qaeda engage in continual armed attacks on the United States, its embassies abroad, and its nationals abroad (especially continual attacks for several years on U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan). The essay refers to and quotes from my article in FSU’s Journal of Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 19 (2010), also available at SSRN. The essay notes that lawful measures of self-defense can occur outside the context of war and without foreign state consent against non-state actors who are directly participating in the armed attacks (DPAA) and, in the context of war, against persons who are directly participating in hostilities (DPH). In either context, general principles of distinction among persons, reasonable necessity, and proportionality will condition lawful uses of force. Indiscriminate uses of force either in self-defense or during war are impermissible."

Some dubbed this doctrine « the Bush revolution, » as they argue that it has been conduced in foreign policy during the first 30 months of the Bush mandate. They view it consisting essentially in forsaking several constraints that had bound the United States to its allies and redefining the key principles that had governed the U.S. involvement in the world affairs for more than half a century. Otherwise, it was a revolution against the very principles that had guided US diplomacy."

The paper also endeavor to point out American legislative response to terrorism in relation to the “wars on terror”. The main research question of the paper is whether a developing and a second highest populated growing country like INDIA should have stringent anti terrorism laws which can erase the issue myth and reality in order to create a scope which looks more better than before or will it still be destroyed by the country’s  political setup which gives it a back lash."
"November 09, 2010","This article critically assesses the role of provisional measures indicated by the International Court of Justice in protecting populations during armed conflict situations and the legal consequences attached to the violation of such measures. A number of relevant cases, including the most recent Georgia v. Russia case, are dealt with. Provisional measures aimed at protecting populations affected by armed conflict have been increasingly requested in the last two decades by states finding themselves at a military disadvantage. Questions remain, however, with regard to the suitability of these incidental proceedings to deal with major political controversies resulting in armed conflict between states. That notwithstanding, it is submitted that although compliance with such orders of the Court remains unsatisfactory, in the long term provisional measures can eventually strengthen state compliance with commonly agreed international human rights and humanitarian law standards."
"November 09, 2010","Dictatorships are generally characterized by their use of repression, which is higher than that of democratic systems. Repression is, jointly with the mobilizing of some political support, one of the two basic instruments dictators use in order to stay in power. There is broad empirical evidence proving that loyalty and cooptation help dictators survive in office. Yet, there is not systematic investigation analyzing the role of repression. Does repression help dictators retain power? This paper is aimed at filling this important gap. In particular, I address the simultaneous relationship existing between survival and repression by implementing a two-stage estimation method. I use data on authoritarian rulers’ survival and modes of exit. Data on repression are from the Political Terror Scale, the Cingranelli and Richards’ Physical Integrity Rights Index, and Freedom House’s civil liberties score. The results show that an increased probability of exit causes important and significant increases in repression levels; and that repression helps increasing the likelihood of dictators’ survival. Further, I also analyze if repression affect differently survival once the modes in which rulers’ can be replaced are disaggregated, and vice versa. Curiously, political terror is found to be only significantly helpful in preventing non-violent and regular exits, but not violent or irregular ones. Instead, restrictions on civil liberties are effective in deterring both types of threats. Similarly, it is only non-violent threats which trigger significant increases in political terror, while the risk of a violent or irregular exit leads the regime to increase restrictions on civil liberties."
"November 08, 2010","The focus of this article is the interplay of an indigenous American idea – popular sovereignty – and two American traditions: vigilante justice and constitutional conventions during the nineteenth century. While the traditions may seem unconnected, they are linked by the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which was based on the notion that “the people” are the ultimate and only legitimate basis for government and that the “the people” possess the right to reform, alter, or abolish their government at any time. What emerged in the debates over both the proposed California constitution of 1849 and the San Francisco vigilante activities of the 1850s were conflicting views about both the scope and means whereby the people could exercise this sovereignty."
"November 08, 2010","Law enforcement interviews are sometimes viewed as among the least intrusive and least objectionable investigative methods in the government’s counterterrorism arsenal. Yet FBI and Customs and Border Protection interviews of U.S. Muslims in the terrorism context involve greater coercion and stigma than prevailing accounts recognize. While such interviews have almost entirely escaped scholarly attention, I argue that as common, direct, and visible encounters between individuals in the U.S. Muslim community and the U.S. government, interviews inform targeted individuals’ and communities’ sense of “belonging” and inclusion in the United States. Moreover, interviews triggered by individuals’ political, religious, or cultural expression or association – those that are based on “First Amendment profiling” – impose particularly grave stigmatic costs and chilling effects on expression. First Amendment profiling, while sometimes justified, is wrong both where the government deliberately seeks to suppress speech and where investigations undertaken for a legitimate law enforcement purpose sweep too broadly in burdening lawful speech and association. I contend that although courts are deeply divided as to which investigations warrant judicial review, and how rigorous that review should be, existing First Amendment doctrine offers the potential for courts to question the questioners in an important segment of cases. Courts should employ heightened scrutiny to evaluate First Amendment profiling rather than categorically defer to law enforcement justifications."
"November 07, 2010","When and why do states kill their own civilians on a large scale, and which countries worldwide are more likely to suffer state-sponsored mass killing in the future? In spite of the obvious and continuing relevance of these questions to policy-makers concerned with preventing or responding to this kind of violence, scholars have undertaken relatively little of the kind of cross-national, comparative research that could serve as the basis for systematic prediction and general understanding of mass killing. In 2006–2007, the Political Instability Task Force (PITF) created a new data set and undertook a statistical analysis to develop models that could be used to help answer these questions. This paper describes the elements of that research and presents the major findings from it. In light of the Task Force’s emphasis on forecasting, it also discusses how this research can be applied to assess countries’ vulnerability to mass killing and presents such assessments for countries worldwide in 2008."
"November 07, 2010","One major challenge before the Indian state today is that of Naxalism, a movement which has a long history and which over a period of time has expanded its influence and violent activities. It is now spread over 14 States covering about 160 districts. This really becomes a matter of concern and hence provokes one to identify the factors which are responsible for its widening base and the increase in its violent activities. In the literature, the factors that are normally identified with the emergence of this movement are political or economic in nature. The present study, however, without undermining the role of these factors, focuses on the psychological factors as vital in the emergence and increasing influence of this movement. But before that the present paper briefly discusses the history of the movement and then directs its efforts towards understanding the role of the psychological factors in the emergence of Naxalism. The term “Naxalite” refers to “all forms of armed struggle that have taken up the cause of socio-economic development of the downtrodden rural masses.” The Naxalite revolt has grown in magnitude and strength for many reasons, political or economic in nature. Some of the political factors which can be identified are: the emergence of the movement coincided with the formation of the first United Front Government in West Bengal (1967) with the Communist Party of India-M as its main constituent, and received increasing official support, attention and press coverage. The study of various factors indicate that Naxalism is the outcome of not just one factor but a number of various factors. One can really have a proper grip of the problem by focusing on the psychology of the individuals who are a part of the movement. The psychological factors synthesise well the above mentioned factors - political and facilitate a clear understanding of the roots of the movement. Furthermore, if we are to delve into understanding and explaining the attitudes and behaviour of the Naxals, we can suggest, not demonstrate (speaking inductively) that they may have some hope in the future but it may so happen that in the future they do not receive any benefits from growth and further their situation can be worsened by a sudden change. All these make them feel that their present situation is worse than the past. All these provide the ground for the rise of psychological tension which erupts in the form of protest activities and thus enables people to establish a link between the real world and their expectations."
"November 06, 2010","The Suez War had long term ramifications for Israel's status in the Middle East and for its relations with the U.S., Europe, and the USSR. This article is a first segment in the examination of the interplay between military and diplomatic means deployed by Israel in its quest to consolidate the gains of the 1948 war and secure its sovereignty. It provides a detailed analysis of the Israeli cabinet deliberations as it reached the decision to authorize war. The article examines the cabinet's opinions on the language of the motion to go to war, the list of casus belli offered, the secret agreement with France and Britain which precipitated the war, considerations of possible complications, the theory of war and peace, the likelihood of regime change in Egypt, and the preparedness of the home front. It raises the question of the relevance of the comparative size and strength of a nation as it ponders the option of launching a war."
"November 06, 2010","Like locating fault lines to determine where earthquakes are apt to develop, examining the history of the affected peoples, particularly who did what to whom, helps explain the advent of terrorism perpetrated by extreme Muslim fundamentalist groups against the West and against the United States in particular. When Russian, American, or European leaders condemn Muslim terrorism and terrorists, they rarely if ever mention the behavior of Russia and European countries towards Muslim ones in the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries."
"November 05, 2010","How an area measuring no more than about 11,000 square kilometers could become arguably “ground zero” for the formation of post-Cold War international law is a bit of a mystery, but the province (and now country) of Kosovo, in the late twentieth/early twenty-first centuries, somehow managed to pull off that feat. In Contested Statehood: Kosovo’s Struggle for Independence Marc Weller provides the best history to date of the Kosovo crisis from the end of the Cold War up to the point that Kosovo’s independence was declared in February 2008. In its July 2009 advisory opinion on that legality of that Declaration, the International Court of Justice avoided a lengthy account of Kosovo’s contemporary history, hewing closely to just those facts and law necessary to answer the narrow question before it.  As such, anyone interested in the backdrop for the Court’s advisory opinion would do well to keep Contested Statehood close at hand."
"November 05, 2010","International Humanitarian Law is still subject to continuous evolution. It is the law both of the international and the internal armed conflicts or civil wars, as well as of armed conflicts which have been internationalized. This work raises the question whether non-international armed conflicts become international or can be internationalized and specifies the requirements for this processes. This work aims to identify ways to improve the conditions during the armed confrontations, the protection of the parties and of the victims of the armed conflict, while the prosecution of the persons responsible for serious violations of IHL is not part of the study. Improving the protection standards in times when the number of international armed conflicts has decreased while the internal armed conflicts has increased in number and in intensity is the key function of the internationalization of internal armed conflicts."
"November 05, 2010","Taking a cue from dicta in the Supreme Court’s most recent pronouncement on foreign affairs preemption, I suggest in this paper that courts faced with thorny questions about the liability of military contractors in war zones should be more straightforward in assessing the balance of interests at stake. In applying its tort law, a state has strong, legitimate interests in punishing and deterring wrongdoing by resident corporations and providing compensation to resident victims (whether they be employees of the contractor, U.S. soldiers, or otherwise). By the same token, the federal government has a paramount and exclusive interest in the conduct of war, although in some circumstances it may see state tort law as useful - as an off-the-shelf mechanism for helping regulate contractor misconduct."
"November 05, 2010","The Canadian intelligence community has been the subject of much controversy relating to its role in global intelligence cooperation and accompnaying human rights abuses.Characterized by the feral exchange of intelligence across national borders, global intelligence cooperation has helped Canada adapt Cold War security institutions to contend with transitioning global environments. Although in many ways necessary, the pace of this change has vastly outstripped changes to traditional regulatory frameworks; a factor not helped by courts' reluctance to exert greater regulatory control in the national security field. In its 2008 ruling in Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), however, the Supreme Court used a dispute over disclosure in security certificate proceedings to magentize efferent intelligence practices around core constitutional principles. Recognizing CSIS’ growing, functional associations with domestic and foreign law-enforcement agencies, as well as the government’s use of immigration provisions in lieu of extradition proceedings, the court held that CSIS and other governmental institutions are obligated to disclose to reviewing courts all information on file relevant to persons named in certificates. Greater levels of disclosure reflective of criminal law values were intended to counter-balance the free exchange of personal information across national boundaries and enhance the performance capacity of court-appointed special advocates; this goal has been achieved to some degree. Notwithstanding the symbolic significance of the ruling, though, the over-arching structure of certificate proceedings and the recent infusion by lower courts of exceptions to the duty to disclose suggest that changes to certificate-based detention and deportation practices are likely to be modest."
"November 03, 2010","The purpose of international conflict-resolution efforts is, in the short term, to bring an end to violent armed conflict, and, in the medium to longer term, to prevent the revival of conflict. However, at least one of the mechanisms often utilised in conflict resolution and peace agreements, power-sharing, may not only prove problematic in early negotiation and implementation, but may potentially be at odds with the longer-term goal of preventing resurgence of conflict. Why might this be the case? Longer-term peace-building seeks to prevent conflict in part by building strong and sustainable states. Such states should be able to avoid reverting to armed conflict because they would be more responsive to grievances and more effective in dealing with violent dissent. However, power-sharing arrangements may undermine such efforts by placing in power individuals and groups not fully committed to, or unable to take part in, governance for the benefit of the entire populace; in part because it necessarily places in power those who have engaged in significant violence to achieve their ends. This is likely to create less democratic states, although we do not insist that democracy is or should be the only goal of peacebuilders. Rather, we suggest that power-sharing arrangements may tend not only towards undemocratic states, but towards states which are not responsive to the needs of the citizenry for security in ways which may undermine human security and state legitimacy."
"November 03, 2010","Much of the time, transitional justice measures are developed alongside the implementation of peace agreements and peacebuilding efforts, and are expected by their framers and advocates to contribute to peace.  The claim is that accountability measures can help to deter future violence and prevent revenge attacks, demonstrate and help to reinstall the rule of law and democracy, and contribute in so doing to longer-term stability. And indeed, transitional justice measures are expected to work alongside specific measures of peacebuilding, such as rule of law promotion, security sector reform, and disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of excombatants, and increasingly those developing such measures of peacebuilding are expected to take transitional justice measures into account.  What happens, however, when a transitional justice measure is developed decades after the end of the conflict, where such standard measures of peacebuilding were not pursued, or are incomplete?  Can a transitional justice mechanism have the desired effects?  And what if that mechanism is not designed to address the wide range of past crimes, but a more recent subset?"
"November 02, 2010","Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. One important human dimension of that vulnerability is the potential for large-scale human displacement as a result of climate change impacts. This article examines the extent to which climate change is likely to impact displacement and migration in and from Bangladesh, and the legal and policy frameworks which might respond to this. It challenges assumptions that there will be mass cross-border displacement from Bangladesh by 2050 requiring regulation through a new international treaty, and that such movement will threaten international security.  This article first describes the impacts of climate change on displacement and migration in Bangladesh. Secondly, it examines the nature of such movement, which is likely to be predominately internal rather than cross-border. Thirdly, it considers the security risks of climate change displacement in and from Bangladesh, focusing on resource scarcity, the risk of radicalization and terrorism within Bangladesh, and the transnational security risks of migration. Finally, it sets out options for law and policy reform with respect to climate change-related movement. It considers the need for adaptation – including through migration – as well as ways in which domestic, regional and international legal frameworks could be strengthened and progressively developed."
"November 01, 2010","That terrorist organisations come and go is a fact. This empirical fact tends to draw attention to the demise of the terrorist organisation and distracts from the dynamics of the terrorist organisation’s life cycle. In this respect, the extant literature suffers from a serious weakness that is symptomatic of the absence from the literature of a rigorous theoretical explanation for the life cycle of terrorist organisations. This paper aims to address this by developing a theoretical explanation for the life cycle of terrorist organisations that is centred on competition for grassroots or popular support between the terrorist organisation and the government. The decline and demise of a particular terrorist organisation is not certain ex ante and a terrorist organisation may be expected to be most dangerous, not in its death throes, but during its early years as it competes with the government for grassroots support. These appear to be different conclusions to those that characterise some parts of the literature on this subject. The theoretical explanation developed herein also predicts a cyclical oscillation of conflict."

"October 31, 2010","This article suggests that programs designed to strengthen the rule of law in general are unlikely to be effective against the widespread problem of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I argue that while weak rule of law perpetuates sexual violence, only rule of law programs designed specifically with respect to the needs, risks, and cultural norms pertaining to Congolese women can help curb this problem. The article begins with a brief history of conflict in the Great Lakes region of Africa to provide context for a discussion of the scope of sexual violence in the eastern provinces of the DR Congo. It then introduces the notion of “rule of law” before evaluating the ways in which weak rule of law in the eastern DR Congo contributes to the problem of sexual violence. Finally, the article makes four arguments to support the central claim that strengthening the rule of law will be effective against sexual violence only if specifically tailored in the ways noted above."
"October 31, 2010","The inauguration of the International Criminal Court and the proliferation of criminal tribunals over the last twenty years are often presented as historic and progressive moments in teh trajectory of international law's response to victims of rape in armed conflicts.  However, these moments may signal not only inclusion, but also repression.  They signal not just progress, but also a renewed rhetorical and institutional legitimatization of colonialism.  Historicizing the advent of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Court, this Article examines some ways that international law obfuscates its complicity in armed conflict rape, looking particularly at calls within the profession for greater efficiency, nation state security, and reparations for victims.  In doing so, this Article grapples with questions concerning the limits and alternatives to our current legal imagination towards rape in armed conflict."
"October 31, 2010","On May 31, 2010, Israeli commandoes stormed an ""activist"" ship, sailing in a flotilla of ships which were carrying aid to the Gaza strip and transporting other activists to this region, which had been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007.  The activists were attempting to draw international support for Gaza, and to spark further condemnation of the Israeli blockade.  In the raid, nine passengers were killed by the Israeli commandoes, dozens of activists were wounded, and several Israeli soldiers were shot.   International reaction was swift: most countries condemned Israel, and even the U.S. President, Barak Obama, voiced ""deep regret"" over the raid. Accounts of what exactly happened on the morning of May 31 vary: Israel claimed that it had been the activists who fired first at Israeli soldiers, causing Israel to fire in self-defense, while activists claimed that it had been the Israeli commandoes which illegally boarded the activist ship and opened fire. What is undoubted is that Israel was involved in yet another international incident involving the Gaza, where its soldiers opened fire killing several individuals.  The May 31 incident fits into an existing paradigm of internationally questionable Israeli military policy over Gaza, and portrays Israel once again as the potential aggressor and occupier over the Gaza strip."
"October 30, 2010","We present game theoretic models of two of the most famous military bluffs from history. These include the legend of Li Guang and his 100 horsemen (144 BC), and the legend of Zhuge Liang and the Empty City (228 A.D.). In both legends, the military commander faces a much stronger opposing army, but instead of ordering his men to retreat, he orders them to act in a matter consistent with baiting the enemy into an ambush. The stronger opposing army, uncertain whether it is facing a weak opponent or an ambush, then decides to flee and avoid battle. Military scholars refer to both stories to illustrate the importance of deception in warfare, often highlighting the creativity of the generals’ strategies.  We model both situations as signaling games in which the opponent is uncertain whether the general is weak (i.e., has few soldiers) or strong (i.e., has a larger army waiting to ambush his opponent if they engage in combat). We then derive the unique Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium of the games. When the probability of a weak general is high enough, the equilibrium involves mixed strategies, with weak generals sometimes fleeing and sometimes bluffing about their strength. The equilibrium always involves the generals and their opponents acting as they did in the historical examples with at least a positive probability. When the probability of a weak general is lower (which is reasonable given the reputations of Li Guang and Zhuge Liang), then the unique equilibrium always involves bluffing by the general and retreat by his opponent."
"October 30, 2010","It is common knowledge that different interpretations of laws lead to differences on what is regarded appropriate responses to legally relevant circumstances. It is less well known, however, to what extent legal schools of thought differ with regard to more fundamental questions, namely what law actually is and how it is determined. Such methodological divergencies are often irreconcilable as they may rest on the political preferences of the respective proponents. A methodological and practical comparison of Positivism and the New Haven School lays bare the overwhelming importance of these divergencies in general and in the particular case of the use of force in international law. From a descriptive point of view both schools of thought are equally legitimate. Viewed against the background of the basic normative functions and purposes of law, however, New Haven School theorists are found to confuse the legal with the political sphere – with severe implications for their enhanced ability to justify the uses of force in international society."
"October 29, 2010","This article fills a gap in the literature by examining in depth China’s state practice and official pronouncements in respect of nine post-Cold War cases typically cited by publicists as evidence of the development of a customary international legal norm of humanitarian intervention. The majority of today’s scholarship holds that the People’s Republic of China’s position on sovereignty and intervention remains inflexible and absolutist, much as it was for the PRC’s first four decades. The contention of this article is that this view is overly simplistic: while China continues to champion a strong conception of state sovereignty in interstate relations, it has signaled a shift from an ideological insistence on non-interference toward a more pragmatic approach to humanitarian crises. In particular, this can be seen in China’s willingness to acquiesce in and even actively support multilateral humanitarian interventions that obtain both Security Council authorization and target state consent, as well as in China’s willingness to use its growing economic and diplomatic leverage to help secure target state consent to intervention."
"October 28, 2010","This is the introductory chapter to our book When Cooperation Fails: The International Law and Politics of Genetically Modified Foods (Oxford University Press). It provides the argument of the book and introduces the individual chapters. We investigate the obstacles to reconciling regulatory differences among nations through international cooperation, and assess what happens when cooperation fails. This work addresses the dynamic interactions of domestic law and politics, transnational networks, international regimes, and global markets, through a theoretically grounded and empirically comprehensive analysis of the governance of genetically modified foods and crops. We show that the deeply politicized, entrenched and path-dependent nature of GMO regulation in the United States and the European Union has fundamentally shaped negotiations and decision-making at the international level, limiting the prospects for deliberation and providing incentives for both sides to engage in hard bargaining and to “shop” for favorable international forums.  We then, in turn, assess the impacts, and the limits, of transnational and international pressures on domestic U.S. and European law, politics, and business practice.  Our emphasis on the intractability of the GMO dispute and the strikingly limited contribution of bilateral networks and multilateral regimes contrasts sharply with much of the literature on international cooperation."
"October 26, 2010","A decade after the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in June 1985, many Canadians were shocked to learn that the Babbar Khalsa Society – a militant organization dedicated to the establishment of an independent state in northern India, members of which are believed to have planned the Air India bombing – had been granted charitable status in Canada. Although the organization’s charitable status was revoked in 1996, reports also suggested that funds collected to support Sikh temples in Canada may have been diverted to support Sikh militancy in India."
"October 26, 2010","Most of the studies that examine the role of religion in conflicts rely on empirical analyses without addressing the prior theoretical question of whether and why religions, or particular classes thereof, should cause conflict. If there is no logical relationship between religion and conflict then there is no point carrying out costly empirical analyses to ascertain if certain religions are more likely to cause conflict. This paper argues that on its own monotheism is neither necessary nor sufficient for conflict."
"October 25, 2010","The Charter of the United Nations is such a treaty. The Charter specifically obligates the Nations to refrain from force or threat of force in international relations. It requires member states to exhaust every peaceful means of settling disputes and to submit disputes which cannot be settled peacefully to the Security Council. The most nations have systematically violated all of these Charter provisions for many years."
"October 25, 2010","The purpose of this article is twofold. It will attempt to address the character of this conflict, in line with the traditional distinction between international and non-international. In this particular conflict, there were differing views due to the status of Hamas, Gaza and the varying interpretations of the relevant legal standards. After examining several options it will become evident that arguments on both the international or non-international character of the conflict could stand. As this is not the first time that there is a considerable difficulty in making the proper classification, the author will further argue in favour of abolishing this dichotomy."
"October 25, 2010","International conflicts over natural resources are frequently cited as the most prominent threat to global peace in the decades ahead. However, this subject has not yet been adequately tackled in the academic literature. This paper contributes to filling the gap by, first, proposing a four-class typology of resource conflicts and by, second, testing these conflict types against data on fossil fuels and interstate conflicts derived from two major conflict datasets: the Militarized Interstate Dispute Dataset (1960-2001) and the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflicts Dataset (1960-2008). The findings, although preliminary, suggest that resource scarcity may play a less prominent role in the aggression of belligerent countries than is often assumed and that the existence of large oil deposits and high resource-rent incomes are better predictors of conflict involvement."
"October 24, 2010","In the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001, private actors have come to occupy a remarkably prominent place in efforts to identify and counter threats of domestic terrorism. Today, seemingly no transaction, whether social, political, or economic, is comfortably beyond eye or earshot of the newly deputized national security apparatchiks. Corporations representing all of the major retail and service industries – including telecommunications, finance, and commercial travel – are routinely turning over reams of information to the government. And, it’s not just corporate data dumps; it’s also doormen, pilots, truck drivers, retail clerks, repairmen, and parcel couriers, who have been enlisted by the government, their employers, and even their own unions to detect and report suspicious activities on the ground. Finally, there is the role being played by ordinary folks, who have been bombarded with calls from government officials to do their part to keep America secure."
"October 24, 2010","The current approach to the war on terror is largely ineffective. Central to this approach are negative sanctions against actual and potential terrorists coupled with attempts to spread liberal democracy through war, occupation, and reconstruction. We argue that negative sanctions are unsuccessful and in many cases counter productive in reducing terrorism. Further, we postulate that efforts to impose liberal democracy in weak and failed states via occupation and reconstruction have in large part failed. Only by returning to a position of principled non-intervention can the war on terror ultimately be won."
"October 24, 2010","Threat to environmental security such as climate change is a security problem that requires local and global solutions. However, the impacts of climate change vary across temporal and spatial scales. For impacts that are local and global, short- and long-term considerations in policy making are imperative. Similarly, although the impact is global, climate change also requires adaptation responses at regional, country and local levels. Government policy nowadays is increasingly challenged by the notions of environmental security, sustainability and governance. Malaysian policy here points toward a national interest and a decision of government on the issue of environmental security. This paper discusses how local and global environmental threats (Especially on climate change) influence policy making in Malaysia."
"October 24, 2010","A successful transition involves balancing a decisive break with the previous regime with the simultaneous minimization of the costs associated with the administration of justice. Where the benefits of pursuing transitional justice outweigh the associated costs, the administration of justice is a net benefit and contributes to the overall transition to liberalism. However, where the costs outweigh the associated benefits, pursuing justice will have the counterproductive effect of damaging the likelihood of establishing a sustainable liberal order. In short, pursuing transitional justice is not an all or nothing endeavor but rather must be thought of in terms of marginal or additional units. The key question is: Does it make sense to invest additional resources in administering justice against members of the previous regime?"
"October 24, 2010","One of the important elements in Malaysian politics is the enactment and continuation of emergency law and regulation adopted by the government to maintain political order and stability in this country. The fundamental issue in Malaysian politics was the existence of emergency law and the declaration of emergency state. Both provide the government and the authorities under it with exceptional power which decide the shape of politics in this country. The ultimate political power enjoyed by them was nonetheless given by the Constitution of the state. What puzzles us is whether Malaysia is still under a state of emergency and whether such law provide security or liability for the people. Since the state independence in 1957 until the collapse of communism in 1989, the need to protect the state from the communist insurgencies and subversive elements has generated emergency law as a form of extra legal responses towards any acts which were considered prejudicial to national security. This article tries to understand the historical and political development of Malaysian Emergencies by utilising declassified primary data from British National Achieve and various secondary data such as books, journals and newspapers."
"October 24, 2010","Apart from military threats, the non-military threat is worth noting. First of all, one of the elements in Malaysian political security is related to ethnicity. The importance of ethnicity is a central factor when discussing almost any issue in Malaysia. The influence of this approach is strong because Malaysia is a multi-ethnic country and most of the political parties were established based on ethnic lines. It is not only questions of leadership, election and voting behaviour that are based on ethnicity, but the policy of the ruling party is also thus affected. It is important to note that as Malaysia experienced a few period of crises, the state security was largely based on the principle of political stability, which not only entailed the creation of Malaysia as a means to secure the state against any threat but also as a conflict management measures to deal with ethnic insecurities. As political development in Malaysia was an extension of ethnic relations, the various manifestations of ethnic problems were related to struggle of political power between ethnic groups."
"October 24, 2010","Religious affiliation is the most vital element in which Malaysia and Saudi Arabia have shared commonalities in their bilateral relations. It is understandably comprehended also that in terms of the character of the relations, Malaysia seems to tend to interact more with the Kingdom, and not vice versa, in order to fulfill its multi-variety of domestic and international necessities. Malaysia has to face various issues that are closely related to the culture of the Islamic development in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In some points these may influence the degree of the relations, particularly to the Islamic traditions of the former. However, based on this study, the expansion of Wahabi Doctrine was limited due to the dominance of the Shafiite School, Malaysia’s religious ‘guarded’ policies, the trend of the Islamic da’wah movement in Malaysia. Furthermore, the approach of Saudi in spreading the Wahabi doctrine was also slow and more efforts were done to strengthen its image and influence among Muslim countries by distributing its wealth to other needy Muslim countries. This will consolidate its position among other stronger Muslim countries."
"October 23, 2010","In international relations theory literature, realist scholars maintain a traditional view of security based on fear and the attainment of survival through power maximization in an anarchic world, achieved exclusively through military prowess. Liberal scholars of international relations contend that the realist conception of security is unnecessarily limited, and call for the broadening of security to include concerns such as economic security, human security, and environmental security. However, is realism inherently incompatible with the concept of environmental security? I argue that by stretching the conceptual limits of realism it becomes possible to account for security concerns related to the environment and climate change. In this paper I seek to incorporate environmental security into the broader framework of realism by analyzing the extent to which environmental problems pose a threat to the survival of major states. I conclude by calling for the development of a grand conceptual approach to environmental security and more empirical research to be conducted on issues that exist at the nexus between security and the environment."
"October 23, 2010","It is difficult to understand conflict within a business groping for higher profits or a bureaucracy producing unmarketed products for unknown reasons. Conflict within the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MET) is easier to observe because it has lasted for over thirty years and because MET produces water for a small number of customers. This paper explores the origin and cost of conflict within MET, a cooperative of 26 member agencies. It then turns to the persistence of conflict and some suggestions for resolving conflicts. The key action requires that institutions designed to handle abundant water be reformed to manage scarce water. I present an economic solution using auction markets that would fit within MET's legal and operational structure, ration water for both equity and efficiency, and recognize past contributions and subsidies by MET's member agencies."
"October 22, 2010","Guantanamo’s historic role in empire explains why the base remains anomalously inside and outside US jurisdiction.   Produced by historic empire, the base’s legal anomaly permits for detaining over 150 men, eight years after detentions began and over a year and half after President Obama ordered detentions to end. Referring to Alejandro Colás’s definition, empire is comprised of space (i.e. territorial expansion without any limit), markets (i.e. wealth-creation through market protection), and culture (i.e. notions of cultural superiority). The Platt Amendment (1902-34) and the Insular Cases (1901-20) point to law’s role in a base for empire’s space, i.e. the law of extraterritoriality. The base’s geopolitical and military functions in protecting US investments overseas, especially the Panama Canal, refer to empire as markets. Notions of Anglo-superiority implicit in foreign relations with Cuba, a US protectorate from 1902 to 1934, reflect empire as culture. This Essay is part of larger project examining the base and current empire as space, markets, and culture. The notion of empire explains why Guantanamo’s anomaly is not an aberration but instead is an intended legal objective."
"October 22, 2010","We compare the characteristics of 77 convicted home-grown Islamic terrorists in the UK to a representative sample of 858 UK Muslims. UK Muslims are more likely to be convicted of terrorism if they are better educated and young, which accords with findings from recent research on the behaviour of Muslims in the US. Other predictors of UK Muslims being convicted of terrorism are employment, marital status, citizenship, and ethnic origin."

It takes a step forward and explores the legal implications, consequences and limitations if such a policy option were to be chosen, but it does not expressly argue in favour or against such an option."
"October 22, 2010","This paper examines the legality of a possible Israeli pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Various arguments are examined, including whether such an attack violates the prohibition on the use of force; whether such an attack is a legal exercise of self-defense; whether such an attack is allowed due to existence of a customary law exception or existence of a state of war between the two states; and whether such an attack can be viewed as international law enforcement. The analysis conducted in this paper demonstrates that under current conditions an Israeli pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear facilities cannot find convincing, legal support under any existing legal arguments."
"October 22, 2010","This article explores the sources and trajectories of Vietnam’s strategy toward China since the last stage of the Cold War. It argues that Vietnam’s China policy in the post-Cold War era has not been guided by a single strategy. Nor is there a pattern of shifting from one strategy to another. What has informed Vietnamese policy is a mixture of four different pathways with a changing salience of components. These pathways are the preferred foreign policy approaches of Vietnam’s two competing grand strategies. As a result of the superposition of the two, Vietnam’s China strategy has been a mix of solidarity, deference, balancing, and enmeshment. Each of these pathways is based on a distinct paradigm of how the world works. Thus balancing is based on realism, solidarity on socialist internationalism, enmeshment on complex interdependence, and deference on asymmetry."
"October 22, 2010","Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 59/283 dated 2 June 2005, the Secretary-General established the Redesign Panel on the United Nations system of administration of justice, which was charged with redesigning the system of the administration of justice at the UN. It was created to address the gravity of the issues that arose out of the immense challenges posed by the management of internal disputes at the UN. The Redesign Panel found that the system of internal justice at the UN was unprofessional, lacked independence, was ineffective, did not accord staff members their due process rights, and the staff had little confidence in the system. The UN is the body charged with the protection of the global order, and it is ironic that its internal justice system was found to be in manifest violation of the rights of its own employees. After years of efforts to reform the internal justice system, a new system of the administration of justice became operational at the UN on 1 July 2009. This paper discusses the establishment and the working of the newly established UN internal dispute resolution machinery. The paper is divided into three chapters. Chapter 1 sets out the context within which international administrative law works, and discusses two issues in particular, the rule of law and due process, and immunities. Chapter 2 deals with the old regime, and Chapter 3 deals with the newly established system. Chapter 2 and 3 not only discuss the working of the now abolished United Nations Administrative Tribunal, and the newly established United Nations Disputes Tribunal and United Nations Appeals Tribunal, but attempt to analyze the dispute resolution process from its very inception. The paper concludes that the newly established machinery at the UN is a genuine attempt to improve the internal dispute-resolution mechanism. However, in addition to a change in the machinery and rules, attitudes of managers and relevant UN staff, including the Secretary-General must change if significant improvement in the manner in which internal disputes are handled at the UN is to be achieved."

"October 21, 2010","The central aim of this thesis is to identify the extent to which human rights and humanitarian norms have impacted upon the transfer of conventional armaments from the US to Middle East allies between 1977 and 2010. That is, did such norms affect what the US said (i.e. declaratory policy) and how it acted (i.e. what it sold). In exploring possible methodological approaches to satisfy the aims of the thesis, one pilot involved assessing the policy discourse leading up to the 2010 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference (NPT RevCon). The Conference concluded with a resolution calling for the near-term establishment of a biological, nuclear, radiological and chemical-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in addition to strict controls over their means of delivery. Preliminary research indicates that during these negotiations, the US has exhibited duplicity in its position towards its Middle East allies: the US supports the control of WMD and missiles in the region, and yet exports significant quantities of conventional arms to regional allies such as Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia."

"October 19, 2010","Human rights law does not appear to enjoy as high a level of compliance as the laws of war, yet is institutionalized to a greater degree. This paper argues that the reason for this difference is related to the strategic structure of international law. The laws of war are governed by a regime of reciprocity, which can produce self-enforcing patterns of behavior, whereas the human rights regime attempts to produce public goods and is thus subject to collective action problems. The more elaborate human rights institutions are designed to overcome these problems but fall prey to second-order collective action problems. The simple laws of war institutions have been successful because they can exploit the logic of reciprocity. The paper also suggests that limits on military reprisals are in tension with self-enforcement of the laws of war. The U.S. conflict with Al Qaeda is discussed."
"October 19, 2010","The main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the socio-economic causes of terrorism and political violence in a sample of 12 countries in Western Europe. Results are mixed. First, we show that in western European countries the classical economic argument of opportunity cost can be confirmed. That is, the larger is the set of economic opportunities for an individual the lower is the likelihood or the willingness for him to be involved in a terrorist activity. Second and, however, in line with modernization theory, expected future economic growth seems to be associated with an increase in current terrorist activities. Eventually, our results also show that terrorist brutality (measured in people killed) is explained following the productivity argument. That is, the number of terrorist casualties is positively associated with real GDP per capita."
"October 18, 2010","This paper investigates whether attacks against Israeli targets help Palestinian factions gain public support. We link individual level survey data to the full list of Israeli fatalities during the period of the Second Intifada (2000-2006), and estimate a flexible discrete choice model for faction supported. We find some support for the 'outbidding'? hypothesis, the notion that Palestinian factions use violence to gain prestige and influence public opinion within the community. In particular, the two leading Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, gain in popularity following successful attacks against Israeli targets. Our results suggest, however, that most movement occurs within either the secular groups or the Islamist groups, and not between them. That is, Fatah's gains come at the expense of smaller secular factions while Hamas' gains come at the expense of smaller Islamic factions and the disaffected. In contrast, attacks by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad lower support for that faction."
"October 18, 2010","The natural state of affairs in international relations is a state of war.   To be very clear, China’s rise is benign.  If, however, China continues to rise in relative to the U.S., then, perhaps China would rival the United States for status as primus interes pares.  For this very reason, I posit, in this paper, that China’s rise in relative power has the potential to threaten U.S. national security.  Essentially, if China rises, then it will indeed be a more formidable opponent.  The logical contra-positive is also true, if China’s is no longer an opponent, then, it is in consequence to China falling.  It is not the case that, whereupon, China’s fall that it could no longer pose a threat, instead, China’s infirmity of economy would make the state a less formidable foe, especially, if the United States attained Space Primacy.  In short, as the corollary of China’s rise, the United States is more insecure, the direct result of internecine nuclear arsenals, among other factors.  If, therefore, the U.S. attains Space Primacy and if the U.S. makes security agreements, then, as a logical consequence, the United States will remain in the most salient position relative to other states."
"October 18, 2010","The Prevention of Torture Bill, 2010 is a legislation which primarily aims to provide for punishment for acts of torture committed or abetted or consented to, by public servants. As stated both in the Preamble, as well as in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ostensible rationale for its formulation is the fulfilment of the requirement of an enabling legislation, necessary if India is to ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1975 [hereinafter “the CAT”]. Accordingly, the Bill defines torture, prescribes necessary punishment and provides certain procedural safeguards relating to the process of investigation. The precise enumerations of these aspects in the Bill however have attracted considerable popular criticism."
"October 17, 2010","This review essay (on Avishai Margalit’s new book On Compromise and Rotten Compromises) discusses the philosophical, moral, ethical and practical dimensions of negotiating with “evil” geo-political partners (those who would establish or maintain inhumane regimes) or those who would do evil things. Although compromise is often thought of as unprincipled and amoral, if not immoral, this essay discusses the moral justifications for some compromises, separating out different categories of permissible, justifiable, or immoral and unjustifiable promises. Although Margalit focuses primarily on macro, large geopolitical negotiations, this essay applies thinking about compromise and morality to more everyday and “micro” negotiations as well. Since compromises often give us some peace, if not full, justice, when are we justified in compromising? What does it mean to “compromise” with those who might be evil, or seek to do evil things? When should we walk away? When can't we walk away?"
"October 17, 2010","In June 2008, a memorandum was written to the African Union (AU) alerting the occurrence of unconstitutional holding of power in Eritrea and urging the AU to apply sanctions.

"October 17, 2010","The crime of genocide is the newest international crime. It must be kept as a separate, distinct, and coherent concept.  It is the first truly subjective crime; all other crime, though requiring mens rea, require only that the defendant consciously committed the criminal acts.  In the case of genocide, however, the underlying criminal acts are no different from the acts required to prove ordinary crimes.  The difference is one of motive. What is being punished by the crime of genocide is the selection of victims according to their involuntary membership in four kinds of groups: national, ethnic, racial, or religious. The distinctiveness of this new crime turns on how seriously prosecutors, defense counsel, and judges in future cases take and examine evidence of a defendant’s motives."

"October 16, 2010","This paper utilizes the Kalman filter approach to examine the impact of the Iraq war on the country betas of 11 equity markets in the MENA region. The Kalman filter model allows the country beta to vary over time conditional on the interaction with Iraq war dummy in the transition equation. The results show that the Iraq war has a positive impact on the country betas of all the MENA countries under study but statistically significant for Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Kuwait. The Iraq war has created a sudden shift in the time paths of the country betas, which reflected in a significant structural break and a dramatic increase of these equity market risks in the region. Although the impact of this geopolitical event is found to be limited to four markets in the region, the results correspond to the impact of the geopolitical events like the Iraq war on equity markets."
"October 16, 2010","Caveat: The title above is quite absurd due to the fact that in the traditional sense of defining security, any country aspiring for weapons of mass destruction or WMD, which obviously nuclear used for developing weapons, is part and parcel of that nexus and is apparently a security issue; in other words it doesn’t need the securitization process."

"October 15, 2010","The International community has been pushing for economic sanctions for Iran, hoping to pressure the leadership from within. While it significantly cuts funding to the regime, straining their ability to pursue their nuclear program, it may counterproductive.  Economic strain may push more Iranians towards aligning with extremist. Furthermore, the intervention of proxy groups like Hezbollah into the conflict, “prepared strategically by Iran during the last six years by arming it with long range artillery and rockets, is meant to give a clear signal to the US, the West and Israel what would happen if serious international sanctions would be decided against Iran or if Iran’s nuclear facilities would be destroyed by an U.S. or Israeli attack."" Evidence does not support that Iran will use nuclear weapons against Israel. Iran will ultimately enforce a ‘nuclear umbrella’ over the region to radicalize and to spread their ‘revolutionary’ fervor."
"October 15, 2010","This paper work assesses the key aspects of a framework for research on revolutions. Our approach includes a heuristic based on an idea suggested by Marx in the 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: ""The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living."" From this maxim of Marx advance on conventional interpretations by postulating that the language and metaphors are a challenge in several respects: (1) The brain is a physical basis for understanding key political revolutions, (2) advances in neuroscience and language (Lakoff/Johnson/Narayanan) have allowed the reconstruction of conceptual frameworks in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics and politics (3) The language expressed in songs, text, flags, emblems, illustrations, slogans, speeches and rumors is key to represent and demonstrate loyalty to the idea of revolution and, more crucially, to ""make"" the revolution, (4) Metaphors are a powerful rational action in revolutionary processes. One interpretation of these can contribute to decipher, for example, how the brain are activated in neural systems that link past and present, how to operate the symbolic frameworks of language to influence political opinion, how metaphors interact with processes artificial simulation or how metaphors evolve in a revolution from simple metaphors."

"October 14, 2010","This article analyzes the central arguments and findings of transitional justice? the study of how incoming rulers address the human rights abuses of outgoing regimes. A scholarly consensus suggests the balance of political power matters most for explanations of transitional justice decision making. However, other important influences include international factors and the passage of time combined with democratic governance and/or emotions. Our review finds no consensus on the efficacy of transitional justice measures, in part because few studies currently exist. However, existing studies suggest that trials and truth commissions neither destabilize democracy nor foster animosity, respectively. Finally, this article considers whether restricting the study of transitional justice to third-wave democracies is appropriate in light of recent developments in long-established democracies."
"October 14, 2010","World trade and energy resources have to pass certain ""choke points"" between areas of production and their final destination. One of these is the Straits of Malacca, the sea passage connecting the China Sea with the Indian Ocean. Trade through the Malacca Straits historically played a major role in the formation of the littoral states such as Srivijaya, Aceh, Melaka, Johore, the Straits Settlements and more recently Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. The Straits are one of the world's most vulnerable areas because of its high potential for political conflict, piracy and ecological disaster. They are not just a conduit for sea traffic from East to West or West to East, but also a crossroads of cultures and societies. With closer regional economic integration cross-Straits communication is increasing. Cross-boundary social networks are ethnically diverse but closely integrated. Thus the Straits bear great opportunities for the economic and social development of the littoral states of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Moreover, peace and stability in the region is a precondition for regional development, for uninterrupted energy supplies and international trade between the European Union and East Asia. Based on field observations and recent statistical sources the paper outlines the current strategic importance of the Straits of Malacca for world trade and regional development."
"October 13, 2010","We analyze an agency model of political competition to examine whether conflict encourages hawkish behavior, and if such behavior can itself aggravate conflict. We consider situations of conflict between a state and an insurgent group, such as a conflict over a piece of land. Negotiations are carried on behalf of the state, by a democratically elected leader, whose ability and ideology are imperfectly observed by the electorate. A more capable leader can cede less land at a lower cost (modeled as the probability of the conflict continuing the next period) than a less capable one, while an ideologically hawkish leader enjoys a greater intrinsic utility from retaining land than a less hawkish leader. Two main results that emerge are: certain types of politicians may be excessively hawkish, (as compared to their first best policy choices), which itself increases the probability of conflict and for any credible voting strategy the probability of re-election for a hawk is greater than for a dove. Finally, we show that the voting equilibrium of this game does not always achieve a constrained Pareto optimum suggesting that third party mediation may improve welfare."
"October 13, 2010","Machiavelli leaves one with both an optimistic and a pessimistic prognostication for the post-Cold War world. On the one hand, the end of that conflict has opened the way for the spread of liberal, constitutional regimes, which he would say are inclined to be more and more meticulous in honoring their commitments. On the other, the temptation to use force to create new facts and thereby force international law into new paths will remain as long as politics is practiced. The contemporary relevance of Machiavelli may be seen in that he urged both realities upon us. I focus on a single incident that postdated the end of the Cold War – the show of force by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the Taiwan Strait in March 1996."
"October 13, 2010","The post-9/11 debate regarding the law and policy of military detention is shot through with flawed assumptions.  It tends to assume, for example, that if the factual and legal predicates for using military detention without criminal charge can be established in the first instance, then for good or ill that model can be sustained over the long term.  It tends to assume that evidence-gathering and other activities associated with criminal prosecution are alien to military training, doctrine, practice and culture. It tends to assume a sharp and exhaustive categorical distinction between the realm of criminal law enforcement and the realm of military detention without criminal charge. At the highest level of generality, it presupposes that the legal framework applicable to detention is relatively static, that it is not responsive to changing strategic circumstances. And not coincidentally it does all of this through the lens of Guantanamo, focusing relentlessly on the peculiar circumstances of slightly less than 800 individuals who have been detained there over time."
"October 13, 2010","In this article, I set out to discuss the dangerous implications the Global War on Terror (GWOT) and, more generally, the attempts of the United States government to address notions of terrorism, and its affect on the safety of U.S. and world citizens.  I am primarily concerned with engaging a poststructuralist critique of the GWOT to strengthen legal discussions of terrorism and national security policy the current system is lacking.  While many in the legal academy have focused on particular issues relating to terrorism, I will engage on a macro-level analysis of the way the legal academy conceptualizes terrorism,  not how it discusses acts of terrorism.  While I am concerned with the legal basis for the GWOT, I am more concerned with how our idea of terrorism affects our ability to address it in our legal and political lives and how these decisions affect our national and personal security.  I will utilize the concept of the ghost in the machine, discussed below, to help further the poststructuralist criticism utilized herein.  Next, I will demonstrate the utility of poststructural and postcolonial criticisms to terrorism and the Global War on Terrorism.  Lastly, I will argue that the GWOT has far-reaching implications that threaten to debase our legal system, casting our civil rights regime into the refuse bin of legal history.  The goal is to provide a poststructural and postcolonial legal framework, available in the legal literature, for scholars, students, and practitioners to use in their further work on terrorism."

"October 13, 2010","This paper work assesses the key aspects of a framework for research on revolutions. Our approach includes a heuristic based on an idea suggested by Marx in the 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living”. From this maxim of Marx advance on conventional interpretations by postulating that the language and metaphors are a challenge in several respects: (1) The brain is a physical basis for understanding key political revolutions, (2) advances in neuroscience and language (Lakoff/Johnson/Narayanan) have allowed the reconstruction of conceptual frameworks in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics and politics (3) The language expressed in songs, text, flags, emblems, illustrations, slogans, speeches and rumors is key to represent and demonstrate loyalty to the idea of revolution and, more crucially, to “make” the revolution, (4) Metaphors are a powerful rational action in revolutionary processes. One interpretation of these can contribute to decipher, for example, how the brain are activated in neural systems that link past and present, how to operate the symbolic frameworks of language to influence political opinion, how metaphors interact with processes artificial simulation or how metaphors evolve in a revolution from simple metaphors."

Part I examines the reasons for and importance of developing an indigenous jurisprudence of rape. Part II addresses tribal jurisdiction issues, particularly the current limitations on tribal authority. Part III provides a historical context for the issue, including examples of the role of colonization in the responses to sexual violence. Part IV shares some visions for the development of a contemporary jurisprudence of rape for indigenous nations."
"October 12, 2010","This paper comments on the Wolzenburg case, in which the Dutch legislation implementing grounds for the refusal of EAW’s has been scrutinized for its compliance with the principle of non-discrimination based on nationality. After a reconstruction of the traditional legal setting of extradition, the paper explores the EAW Framework Decision’s relevant provisions and their normative context: mutual recognition and mutual trust. It discusses the Opinion of Advocate General Bot and the judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber), which diverge in many respects. My analysis first highlights the limits of current interpretations of the principle of mutual recognition. Secondly, I scrutinize the broad margin of discretion that member states enjoy when implementing a mutual recognition instrument. Finally, the paper draws attention to European citizenship, which is at present nothing but a ‘spectre’ of the AFSJ, but which has great potential for a sound AFSJ construct, where state powers cannot discriminate against individuals according to their status personae."
"October 12, 2010","An early Communist movement in Malaysia (formerly Malaya) was a reaction to the emergence of the ideology and its movement in Indonesia and China. Malaysian Communist Party (MCP) itself was both a political and militant movement, inspired by the Indonesian Communist Party and Chinese communist Party in the Republic of China. Despite acting as liberation guerilla, MCP was also politically active especially among the Chinese community in Malaysia. It struggled not only to gain independence from the British colonialization but also aimed at securing the Chinese community in Malaysia. Based on declassified data gathered from British National Archive and various secondary readings, I argued that MCP was internationally inspired by international communist movement and at the same time act independently at a local level. Its aim was to gain political power in Malaysia and to establish a Socialist Republic of Malaya. Because of its political aims, MCP was banned and was acknowledged by the Malaysian ruling regime as a threat to political security in Malaysia. Therefore until now, the government rejects any efforts to recognized communism as ideology or movement. In order to understand this issue, the chronology of MCP movements and evident of its international inspired activities are critically discussed here."
"October 12, 2010","Broadly, this article addresses the legal community's response to and treatment of Vietnam veterans suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  The purpose of this article is to add to the growing body of knowledge that is helping to demystify PTSD as a legal/psychological phenomenon.  It begins with a brief description of the symptoms characteristic of PTSD and a history of the scientific understanding of the disorder.  Next a number of cases in which PTSD has been a factor are reviewed and some solutions to strategic problems posed by PTSD in criminal litigation.  The article then discusses the application of PTSD in other contexts, including plea negotiations, sentencing, and post-conviction relief.  The article concludes that proper legal representation of veteran clients requires sensitivity to PTSD in issues of client behavior and that the legal system must be allowed to take PTSD into account, where it exists, to resolve adequately the legal issues raised by PTSD-related conduct."
"October 12, 2010","Traditional accounts in both the international law and international relations literature largely assume that great powers like the United States enter into international legal commitments in order to resolve global cooperative problems or to advance objective state interests. Contrary to these accounts, this Article suggests that an incumbent regime (or partisan elites within the regime) may often seek to use international legal commitments to overcome domestic obstacles to their narrow policy and electoral objectives. In this picture, an incumbent regime may deploy international law to expand the geographical scope of political conflict across borders in order to isolate the domestic political opposition and increase the influence of foreign groups or governments sympathetic to the regime’s objectives. The political opposition may in turn seek to exploit the existence of a fragmented system of domestic institutions to thwart both the adoption and enforcement of any international law that strengthens the ruling regime and weaken its own position. Finally, this Article sketches a framework for predicting when distributive international legal commitments are likely to be sustainable across electoral cycles and when they are not. More specifically, the framework suggests that an international legal commitment is likely to be electorally sustainable when the veil of ignorance underlying the commitment is sufficiently thick; in other words, an international commitment entered into by a partisan regime has more staying power if it produces policy outcomes that are favored by some salient groups in the political opposition. The Article uses examples from the United States experience with human rights and international trade to illustrate how partisan dynamics between Republicans and Democrats has helped spawn and restrict the scope of international legal commitments."
"October 12, 2010","This paper aims at understanding the magnitude of the 1963 Indonesian Confrontation as part of the political and military dimension of Malaysian security. Confrontation was both a political and military threat to Malaysia’s sovereignty and independence. The Indonesian Confrontation posed political and military threats to Malaysia. The political threat was in the form of Communist influence on the Indonesian government and the possibility that it might took over the state. The Communists declared that the formation of Malaysia was against their aim. The Confrontation itself was a military operation, which aimed to strengthen Indonesian political pressures toward Malaysia. It consisted of the Indonesian Army, the TNKU, Indonesian volunteers and ICP guerrillas. The ICP also cooperated with the Communist movement and political parties in Malaysia. In order to understand the issue, we will first discuss the background and reasons for the Confrontation and then explain the military and political threats. Finally, we will examine how the Confrontation was ended."

"October 11, 2010","Uncertainty in payoffs is a central feature of collective action in contentious contexts such as protests and revolutions.  We integrate payoff uncertainty into a model of collective action. We model the “calculus of protest” of individuals who must decide whether to submit to the status quo or mount a revolution based on their personal assessments of the status quo.  When deciding whether to revolt, a citizen must infer both the value of the status quo, and the actions of other citizens, which reflect their information about the relative values of the status quo and revolution.   When a citizen is too willing to revolt, she deprives   other citizens from optimally conditioning the outcome on their joint information, and hence reduces their willingness to revolt. We characterize the conditions under which: (a) less accurate information about the status quo can increase the likelihood of revolt; (b) common knowledge and public signals  can reduce the likelihood of collective action and even successful revolution; (c) harsher punishment can increase the incidence of punishment; and (d) the incidence of revolt is positively correlated with the incidence of repression when failed revolt is punished harshly, but negatively correlated when punishment is slight."
"October 11, 2010","In “Oil Wealth and Regime Survival in the Developing World, 1960-1999“ Benjamin Smith examines the effects of oil wealth, as well as of sudden changes in oil prices, on regime failure, political protest and civil war. He finds that oil wealth is robustly associated with more durable regimes, and significantly related to lower levels of anti-state protest and civil war. In this comment, I discuss Smith's empirical approach - especially his treatment of possible reverse causality between conflict and economic performance, his use of the Polity democracy index, and his choice of the resource dependence variable - and provide suggestions for improvement."

"October 10, 2010","Since the end of World War II, politicians and human rights activists have called for political reconciliation in dozens of countries in transition to democracy around the world.  Political reconciliation remains one of the most important and controversial challenges for such transitional societies. It is important because achieving some degree of reconciliation is critical to the pursuit of peacemaking globally.  Yet, it is also controversial, both the morality of pursuing political reconciliation remains unclear (e.g., given that the promotion of reconciliation by the state is considered by some to be fundamentally illiberal) and because there is significant disagreement about what kinds of processes (e.g., amnesty, criminal trials, truth commissions) are effective in promoting political reconciliation."
"October 10, 2010","The present paper explores how the concept of Human Security can be approached through phenomenology. First, two phenomenological studies dealing with perceptions of short, mid, and long term threats and structural violence are  reviewed and analyzed. A brief literature review dealing with Human Security reveals a dearth of studies from a phenomenological perspective. Finally, a research plan for the study of Human Security is provided to show how an interdisciplinary paradigm usually studied from a critical or constructivist perspective can also be approached from a phenomenological point of view. The paper concludes that phenomenology can fill an important gap between theory and practice in terms of finding links between individual perceptions of Human Security and critical studies of both sociopolitical underdevelopment in emerging nations and structural violence."
"October 10, 2010","As a Commissioner on the federal Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan established by Congress in 2008, I have been immersed in the issue of how to control the abuses and injuries of private security contractors. The key incident epitomizing this issue occurred in late 2007, when members of the Blackwater Worldwide (Blackwater) private security firm were escorting a convoy of State Department personnel through Baghdad.  At Nisour Square, the Blackwater guards, some of whom claim they faced a threat, opened fire on civilians, killing seventeen Iraqis.  Public attention continued as five Blackwater employees were indicted in December 2008, and the case continued in 2009 until the court dismissed the charges due to improper prosecutorial use of the guards’ statements. Negative Iraqi public perceptions of private security contractors continued from 2009 to 2010."
"October 09, 2010","If any one sentence about international law has stood the test of time, it is Louis Henkin’s: “almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all of the time”. If this is true, why is this true? What makes it true? How do nations invent rules that then turn around and bind them? Are international rules simply pragmatic and expedient? Or do they embody values such as the need for international cooperation? Is international law a mixed game of conflict and cooperation because of its rules, or do its rules make it a game of conflict and cooperation? It is hard to imagine a set of rules in all of human history that is more important and less understood than the rules of international law."
"October 09, 2010","Recruitment into rebel groups and extralegal organizations must by necessity occur in an institutional vacuum, where there are no formal means of enforcement of promises of allegiance and agreements made by the entrants. How do recruiters establish that candidates are trustworthy? I conducted interviews in tribal areas and jungles in south India, to understand how upper-caste candidates signal trustworthiness to enter the Naxalites (left-wing guerrillas operating in India; they are a banned terrorist group). The Naxalites are engaged in a protracted civil war against the state, and their end goal is to usher in a communist revolution. Although the Naxalites are predominantly a lower-caste group seeking to empower the lower castes against upper-caste oppression, the group was founded by upper castes and regularly inducts upper-caste candidates, who later tend to occupy positions of leadership. I find that ex-post measures of enforcing compliance (such as violence and exercise of social norms) are insufficient. Upper-caste candidates engage in costly signaling by way of systematic self-abnegation, self-harm, and burning economic and social bridges as commitment devices to show their credibility. They must demonstrate both their intentions to remain faithful (i.e., their all-in payoffs are loaded against defection) and that they have the capacities and skills to remain faithful, such as enduring police beatings and torture."

Israel's claims on annexed territories (East-Jerusalem) is thus scrutinized, as well as the title on West Bank and Gaza, tracing back to the Ottoman Empire, the League of Nations Mandate and the UN. Furthermore, emphasis has been put on the legal title which can be asserted by the latter over Jerusalem; obvisously, the right of the Palestinian (arab) people to self-determination is examined."
"October 08, 2010","Throughout the 20th century the major powers in the global Anglosphere often found themselves allies in armed conflict. These war-time alliances – sometimes temporary, more often part of a longer term cooperation – are sometimes held to arise because of common histories, common values, similar national ideologies and similar notions of international right and wrong. Indeed, the political rhetoric surrounding declarations of war has often cited such factors as colonial history, international friendship and “special relationships” as motivators for joining armed coalitions against third party states. Yet while there stand stark examples of these major English speaking powers acting entirely in congress there exist numerous instances where one or more of these powers chose not to join a coalition alongside their Anglophonic associates. This paper argues that explanations of Anglophonic coalitions that rely on notions of a shared history, similar political ideologies, common political and social values or similar notions of international morality all fall short of explaining the coalition joining/rejecting behaviour of the major powers of the Anglosphere in war-time during the 20th century. Drawing on data from the Correlates of War (CoW) project, this paper will show that pure national interest drove the decisions of states to join or reject coalitions, lending strong support to a structural realist explanation for their behaviour."
"October 08, 2010","As a consequence of anarchy and the insecurity in the international system, the United States promotes, supports, and defends democracy. In an anarchic international system, the putative assurance of security for any state is indeed power. The United States retains a salient position in the international system as a formidable military power. To assure its security in the world the United States relies on a preponderance of power, and promotes its own form of governance, for it has proven competent – thus decreasing anarchy. Therefore, if democracy is promoted in this world, then it is indeed a logical consequence of ubiquitous anarchy – a cause of war in many cases, that is amongst power rivals. What is more, if in fact a state is coerced, then, to be sure, it was a logical result of proving baleful. If, however, the state is in fact competent, then, there is indeed no good reason for coercion. To be realistic, the logical contrapositive is, admittedly, not the world we live in; instead, it is, in this case, a world where coercion was indeed necessary. A negative corollary, incidentally, was engagement, and by this I mean, the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq – a costly resolution for U.S. National security."
"October 08, 2010","Extralegal and rebel organizations often extort civilians to raise funds for their operations. A key issue in this process is overcoming informational asymmetries regarding extortionists’ membership in the extralegal organization. In this paper, I examine how victims determine if an extortionist belongs to an extralegal organization, in this case a left-wing guerrilla/terrorist group in India called the Naxalites, or is merely a “deceptive mimic” (a fake)? I interview police, victims of extortion, Naxalites, and arrested Naxalite mimics to understand how the Naxalites use costly signals to “help” victims distinguish real Naxalites from Naxalite mimics. Naxalites’ tactics include quoting Marxist-Leninist literature to appear learned, singing revolutionary songs, carrying guns, and bringing along female rebels. I find that a key feature differentiating a small group of extortionists from an organized rebel group is the latter’s ability to use a large and efficient network to gather information about victims finances. For high-valued victims, Naxalites use these resources at a relatively lower cost than unorganized mimics to gather information about victims’ assets or recent earnings. By using this information to set their extortion price precisely and by revealing they know details about the victim that are hard to learn, they authenticate their claims to group membership. However, I also discover two types of situations in which Naxalite mimics succeed in passing as Naxalites. First, even though the Naxalite mimics sometimes use low-cost signals and demand small amounts of money, risk-averse victims fall prey when they are not able to see that it is not worth the time of real Naxalites to demand small sums given their higher expected costs of punishment if caught. Costs of punishment are expected to be higher for real Naxalites because they will also face terrorism charges. Second, I discover that some mimics are ex-Naxalites, who are more or less as capable of using costly signals as the Naxalites and therefore succeed."
"October 08, 2010","For decades, a significant part of the literature regarding the economics of war, sought to provide important economic meanings to armed conflicts.

"October 06, 2010","This article discusses the U.S. aerial bombings of Yugoslavia and Kosovo that took place in 1999 in the name of human rights, and what can be learned from them. The bombings killed thousands of civilians, and appear to have had a destabilizing effect on international affairs by undermining the principle of national sovereignty. However, whether this war was really about human rights, or whether it was more akin to the use of human rights claims to justify acts of aggression is less obvious. The answers to three specific questions can help clarify the answer to this dilemma. First, did the bombing accomplish the stated ""human rights"" or strategic objectives of NATO? Second, are the claimed objectives credible as the real reasons for the bombing? Finally, if the answers to these questions are negative, what are the unstated reasons behind the first post WW II aerial bombing of a European state by the U.S. and its allies? This article explores the answers to these questions."
"October 06, 2010","When mediation was first introduced to the courts, the process was hailed as “alternative.” Mediation gave disputants the opportunity to discuss and resolve their dispute themselves; the role of the third party was to facilitate the disputants’ negotiations, not to dictate the outcome; and because the disputants were able to focus on their underlying interests in mediation, the process could result in creative, customized solutions. The picture of mediation is changing, however, as the process settles into its role as a tool for the resolution of personal injury, contract, and other nonfamily cases on the courts’ civil dockets. Attorneys dominate the mediation sessions, while their clients play no or minimal roles. Mediators are selected for their ability to value cases and to assess each side’s strengths and weaknesses. Mediators also increasingly bypass or marginalize the joint session in order to move quickly to caucuses. Moreover, a surprisingly small percentage of the settlements produced by these mediation sessions are creative or even nonmonetary. Mediation’s shift strongly suggests that the bargaining paradigm that dominates and delivers settlements in most civil cases is capturing the mediation process. Significant theory and research in negotiation and decision making support the move toward attorney dominance, evaluative intervention, the marginalization or abandonment of joint sessions and traditional monetary settlements.  If mediation is viewed simply as a means to enhance the deal-making that occurs in the negotiated settlement of most civil cases, the process’ evolution appears to represent a successful adaptation to the realities of our civil system of “litigotiation.”"

"October 04, 2010","For centuries, the United States has seized individuals oversees and, outside any formal extradition process, brought such individuals to the United States to stand trial.  A more recent wrinkle has been the transfer of such individuals to other countries for the purposes of prosecution or interrogation.  Known as “rendition operations,” such transfers have often been criticized.  Numerous commentators, asserting that many of  these activities violate U.S. law, have called on the U.S. government to cease such operations and prosecute U.S. officials who engage in them.  Nonetheless, a Special Task Force established by President Obama recently advocated the continued used of rendition operations, though with some policy changes.  In order to effectuate such changes, and understand their impact, the Administration, as well as the critics and proponents of rendition operations, need to understand current U.S. law regarding renditions.  Yet, despite all the focus, concern and criticism over rendition operations, no scholarly work to date has evaluated the entirety of U.S. law regarding such activities.  This article proposes to do just that.  It concludes that, upon close inspection of U.S. law, there are virtually no legal restrictions on these types of operations.  Indeed, U.S. law does not even preclude the United States from rendering individuals to a third country in instances where the third country may subject the rendered individual to torture.  The only restrictions that do exist under U.S. law preclude U.S. officials from themselves torturing or inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on individuals during rendition operations, or rendering individuals from a place of actual armed conflict or occupation – all of which prove to be narrow limitations indeed.  Finally, few actual means exist to prosecute or sue U.S. officials engaged in rendition operations, due to limitations in civil and criminal statutory authority, as well as the courts’ continuous reluctance to consider such claims."
"October 02, 2010","The rise of international arbitration was driven by the globalisation of commerce in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the development of international law to regulate relations between the Great Powers. The history of the Western Balkans region in the same period insulated it from these influences, and thus arbitration remained unfamiliar. In the communist period, arbitration represented the antithesis of the political purposes assigned by the communist authorities to the domestic legal system. In the wars following disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, institutional capacity was further weakened by elite capture of judicial institutions. That legacy persists to the present day; but its effect is to exclude a significant proportion of the potential levels of foreign investment in the region. International arbitration remains a valuable tool for escaping partial domestic court systems and its use is likely to increase as the Western Balkans becomes increasingly open to foreign direct investment."
"October 01, 2010","This chapter discusses the various kinds of national security threats to China. It divides the threats into “high threats” and “low threats”. For “high threats”, they include the separatist movements fighting for independence from China and the “subversive” forces with an ostensible political goal to overthrow the monopoly of power held by the Chinese Communist Party. The term “low threats” in this chapter refers to the ad hoc, individualistic violence against the society at large with certain vaguely conceived political motivation, including the killing of judges, police officers and other government officials as a form of protest against certain government action. While China’s reaction to the high threats is swift, repressive and comprehensive, it has often neglected the individualist violence because it does not pose a direct challenge to the Party-state. Given the social and economic transition has enhanced people’s expectation and aspirations and generated new conflicts but the institutions lack the necessary legitimacy or capacity to contain and resolve social conflicts, such individualistic terrorism is increasing in intensity and frequency in China. The state is, however, less prepared for the emerging low threats which take the form of politically-motivated but individualistic violence."
"September 30, 2010","To explain the differences in how George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama have exercised executive powers, one metaphor is to compare the Presidents to Odysseus.  One formula comes from Justice Jackson’s famous concurrence in the Steel Seizure Case.  And one set of facts relates to programs that involve the Central Intelligence Agency.  As to the use of Predator strikes, irregular renditions, military commissions, the state-secrets privilege, and the enemy-combatant label, there has been surprising continuity between presidential administrations.  Obama, adding bows and ribbons, has changed the packaging of aggressive programs more than their contents.  And Jackson’s categories are less useful than other academics would have you believe."
"September 30, 2010","Investment treaties often require that an investment be made in accordance with the law of the host-State in order to receive protection under the treaty. As such, a tribunal hearing claims under such an investment treaty does not have jurisdiction over claims relating to illegally made investments. Even where no such requirement is present, there is an emerging trend, though inconsistently applied, that requires investments to comply with both host-State and international law in order for claims based on those investments to be admissible. Drawing on international case law and general principles of law this article discusses when an investment’s non-compliance with the law should act as a barrier to the investor’s ability to pursue its claims under an investment treaty."
"September 29, 2010","This paper critiques the Foreign Affairs and National Security Policy and Strategy (FANSPS) of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE). The thrust of its argument is that the central purpose of Ethiopia's foreign and security policy has remained the same, in spite of the shift in orientation. A change in discourse has not brought about a change in essence. Building Ethiopia’s defense capability takes precedence over ensuring human security in Ethiopia today.  Non-military aspects of security have been relegated to a secondary place whilst human security should have been made to constitute the basis of the FANSPS. Besides, the Government must recognize the critical role of women in peace-making, peace-building, and security. To that end, it should come up with a workable national action plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and work aggressively to get a critical mass of women into leadership positions in the foreign affairs and security sector."
"September 29, 2010","The history of terrorism is as much European as Middle Eastern, and as much secular as religious. More than 2,000 years ago the first known acts of what we call now terrorism were perpetrated by a radical offshoot of Zealots, a Jewish sect active in Judea during the first century AD. The Zealots resisted the Roman Empire’s rule of what is today Israel through a determined campaign primarily involving assassination. Zealot fighters used the sica, a primitive dagger, to attack their enemies in broad daylight, often in crowded places or on feast days; essentially wherever there were people to witness the violence. Thus, like modern terrorist, the Zealots intended their actions to communicate a message to a wider target audience: in this instance, the Roman occupation forces and any Jews who sympathized or collaborated with the invaders. Between 1090 and 1272 an Islamic movement known as the Assassins used similar tactics in their struggle against the Christian Crusaders who had invaded what, is today part of Syria. The Assassins embraced the same notions of self-sacrifice and suicidal martyrdom evident in some Islamic terrorist groups today. Until the French Revolution (1789-1799), religion provided the main justification for the use of terrorism. This situation changed, however, as nationalism, anarchism, Marxism, and other secular political movements emerged during the 1800s to challenge the divine rule by monarchs. Modern terrorism was initially antimonarchical, embraced by rebels and constitutionalists during the last stage of French Revolution and in Russia by the People’s Will Organization. The people will was active between 1878 and 1881. Its revolutionary, antigovernment orientation became the model for future terrorist. The group selected targets that represented the state oppressive instruments of power, and it embraced “propaganda by the deed,” using the terrorist act to instruct. Tsar Alexander II was assassinated by a member of the People’s Will in March 1881. Terrorism continued for many decades to be associated primarily with the assassination of political leaders and the heads of state. This was symbolized by the killing of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand by a 19-year-old Bosnian Serb student, Gavril Principia, in Sarajevo on 28th June 1914. During the 1920s and 1930s, terrorism became associated more with repressive practices employed by dictatorial states than with the violence of non-state groups like the anarchist. The word terrorism was used to describe a wanton violence and intimidation inflicted by the Nazi, fascist, and totalitarian regimes that respectively came to power in Germany, Italy and Soviet Union. The repressive means these governments employed against their citizens involved beatings, unlawful detentions, torture, so-called death squads (often consisting of off-duty or plain-cloths security or police officers), and other forms of intimidation. Such practices by governments against their citizens even continue today."

"September 29, 2010","Solarz argued that Israel's air strike ""must be considered an understandable and legitimate act of self-defense."" The point is that if a war exists between Iraq and Israel, Israel's bombing of the Osiraq nuclear reactor is just a normal and legitimate part of the general conduct of war. Whether or not Israel or Iraq, or both, regarded themselves as being in a state of war, any hostilities between them would amount to separate breaches of the peace in the eyes of the international community and would subject either country to forcible intercession by the U.N. Security Council. I quoted the U.N. Security Council resolution which ""strongly condemned"" Israel's air strike."
"September 29, 2010","UNSCR 1325, as one of the most important UN resolutions within the field of peace and security, was adopted unanimously on 31 October 2000. On several occasions, UN member states were invited to prepare national action plans in order to take strong steps towards the implementation of UNSCR 1325. This research analyzes the implementation of UNSCR 1325 in Ethiopia against a modest conceptual elucidation of the concept of ‘inclusive security’. The conceptual analysis paves the way for an evaluation of its implementation of under the rubric of inclusive security in Ethiopia so far."
"September 29, 2010","The main purpose of this essay will be to focus on certain key questions raised under the prevailing circumstances through a comparative analysis of the handling of the display of religious symbols in public places. These questions include: whether, assuming commitments to pluralism, multiculturalism and religious and non-religious comprehensive views, there may be ways to improve on existing models or to replace them with ones that are better suited to accommodate the new religious and political realities, and whether tolerance can be redeployed to buttress pluralism and to avoid falling into an irreconcilable conflict between religious fundamentalism and antireligious secularism."
"September 28, 2010","This paper tries to investigate the economic consequences of a scenario where the EU imposes economic sanctions on Sudan. The idea of the paper is motivated by the deteriorating relations between Sudan and EU endorsed by the devastating conflicts in Darfur region and its related implications in which the ICC is involved. Another factor supporting the idea is the U.S. encouragement to create multilateral pressure on the country, hence change the behavior of the government. The global CGE model of GTAP and its Africa Database is employed in this paper. The simulation bans importation into the EU from Sudan as well as exportation to Sudan from the EU. The 39 regions of GAD are aggregated to 12 including Sudan, EU, and other regions related to Sudan, while the 57 sectors are aggregated to 15. The results suggest that both income and expenditure sides of the Sudanese GDP will decline due to sanctions. Trade balance will witness a surplus due the big decline in the country’s imports, as all imports will fall. However, the major impact is coming from the decreasing EU sourced imports like light manufacturing, petroleum-coal products, and heavy manufacturing which represents big shares in the total Sudanese imports value. At the time that the results denominate Sudan as the ultimate looser, it shows that the East Asian countries led by China are gaining. Most of the Sudanese trade with the EU seems to be shifting to these countries. However, ‘Rest of Africa’ region doesn’t have any welfare losses, while it has gains in some sectors. Domestic output in MENA, Egypt, Kenya, and Ethiopia in some sectors will fall due to the EU sanctions on Sudan, reflecting the regional dimension that sanction can have."
"September 28, 2010","The military is a major driver of technological, world-changing innovations, such as the Internet. Ethical and policy concerns arising from such technologies, therefore, are not limited to military affairs, but they can have great implications for society at large. This paper will focus on two technology areas making headlines today and in the future: human enhancement technologies and robotics, representing both biological and technological upgrades to the military. The concerns we will raise are about (1) the unintended effects that these technologies could have on society and (2) the possible self-defeatingness of these military programs.  Given that society also can influence military programs, e.g., through civil protests, it is important for the military to attend to such concerns."
"September 27, 2010","This article addresses the issue of consensual forcible intervention in internal armed conflict – meaning, intervention undertaken with the consent of a party to an internal conflict – and seeks to clarify the place of such interventions within the framework of the law of international agreements in conjunction with the law on the use of force. The article analyzes the question of consent strictly in the context of the relations between a consenting party and an external intervener (“procedural consent”), as opposed to questions regarding the internal legitimacy or capacity of a party to express consent (“substantive consent”) – which are not dealt with in this article. The article attempts to demonstrate that consensual forcible interventions, in their ""procedural"" sense, are regulated by firm and accepted norms of international law. These are found in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), in customary international law, in the law on the use of force, and are augmented by the law of state responsibility. The article seeks to systematically elaborate on these frameworks and to clarify them. It demonstrates the general dynamics of consensual interventions, exemplifying these as they occurred in the different stages of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo; it then addresses the regulation of consensual interventions under the VCLT and customary international law; discusses the question of withdrawal of consent and aggression; analyzes the dilemma of forward-looking consent in the context of regional defense treaties; surveys the role of consent in relation to U.N. Chapter VII interventions; and briefly touches upon the question of consent and non-state actors, exemplifying this issue through the analysis of the development of the legal status of the Palestine Liberation Organization."
"September 26, 2010","The status of the Gaza Strip as occupied territory has been the subject of renewed policy, judicial and academic debate following a series of noteworthy developments in the territory since 2005. This article considers the present status of Gaza from the perspective of international humanitarian law in light of these events, which include Israel’s ‘disengagement’ from the Gaza Strip in 2005, its declaration of Gaza as a ‘hostile territory’ in 2007, and the military action labeled ‘Operation Cast Lead’ which commenced in late 2008. It addresses the concept of occupation and the application of the laws of belligerent occupation, making recourse to the travaux préparatoires of relevant treaties, and international and national jurisprudence. In focusing on the situation in the Gaza Strip, the article assesses the various criteria identified in customary international law for determining the existence of a situation of occupation."
"September 26, 2010","In the wake of the respective contentions put forward by Israel and the Palestinians in the context of 'Operation Cast Lead', this paper seeks to revisit the debates regarding Palestinian statehood that simmered in international legal circles following the 1988 Declaration of Independence, and the signing of the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s. In considering the matter, a number of questions beg; not least regarding over which territory or territories the purported Palestinian state is constituted, who the representative authorities of that state are, how a ‘state’ is construed in international law, and for what purpose. The paper accordingly looks at the concepts of statehood and sovereignty in international law and considers their application in the Palestinian context."
"September 26, 2010","This brief report, prepared for the Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice and dated September 22, 2010, analyzes the state and the underlying causes of the current breakdown of the rule of law in Sri Lanka. The information herein is drawn primarily, while not exclusively, from three sources: Basil Fernando, Sri Lanka: Impunity, Criminal Justice & Human Rights (Asian Human Rights Commission: Hong Kong, 2010); Justice in retreat: A report on the independence of the legal profession and the rule of law in Sri Lanka (International Bar Association Human Rights Institute [IBAHRI]: London May 2009); Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, The Rule of Law in Decline in Sri Lanka- Study on the Prevalence, Determinants and Causes of Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment (Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims: Copenhagen, 2009). The Pinto-Jayawardena report provides a detailed analysis of the causes behind the breakdown of the rule of law in Sri Lanka, while Fernando’s work provides a conceptual and critical analysis of overarching themes that is extremely useful for understanding the situation in Sri Lanka. Facts and figures are also drawn from a wealth of other reports and analyses published by a range of actors, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists, Reporters Without Borders, the International Crisis Group, United Nations Human Rights Council Special Rapporteurs, the European Union, and the Office of War Crimes Issues of the United States Department of State."
"September 24, 2010","In this paper I, examine the existing Islamic justifications for perfidious violence against one's own state of citizenship, both when the target is a military one and when it is a civilian one. I show how the primary examples of such justifications, most notably in the case of the Yemeni-American Anwar al-'Awlaqi, fail to address the consensus position in the Islamic legal tradition that it is impermissible to violate a contract of mutual security with a non-Muslim state of residence. I also discuss what the phenomenon of 'Awlaqi says about the state of authority and knowledge in Islamic law and the relevance of Islamic jurisprudence for Muslim minorities."
"September 24, 2010","Thus the theory goes that he who wants war does not fight but he who fights does not want war. In fact, a leader wants war but never goes to the battle field. But an unwilling soldier is compelled to go to the battle field to face gunpowder. He is charged with the sentiment to protect the chastity of motherland. But he dies and his motherland is enjoyed by the politicians. In any war or violence women and children are the worst victim."
"September 24, 2010","The twenty-first century kicked off in America with an awful shock: September 11, 2001 will be remembered as a day that has tremendously influenced the course of history.

"September 23, 2010","Does the Asia Pacific region need a new regional security architecture, and if so, what form should it take? The question of resolving or at least managing the regional security environment has become more important as calls for new security arrangements are being made in response to the changing dynamics which affects the region’s stability. Various security challenges brought about by the rise of China and India, the growing recognition of the impact by transnational and non-traditional security concerns along with traditional security concerns such as the potential conflict in the South China Sea and the instability of the Korean Peninsula have heightened the awareness of policymakers, scholars and analysts to the region’s shortcomings in terms of institutional arrangements designed to resolve potential crisis. The ASEAN Regional Forum’s redirection to focusing on non-traditional security concerns and wariness towards moving to preventive diplomacy has made supporters and critics alike to think of regional security architecture that can address the ARF’s shortcomings. This paper analyzes the debate and provides a summary of the choices confronting policymakers. The paper suggests that the evolving regional security architecture’s development will be gradual and based on existing institutions, balancing the concerns of powerful states with less powerful ones and moving towards a community rather than remaining on the current cooperative security framework."
"September 23, 2010","This report outlines India’s current interests in Afghanistan, how it has sought to achieve these aims, and the consequences of these actions for India, Pakistan, and the international efforts to stabilize Pakistan. It argues that India’s interests in Afghanistan are not only Pakistan-specific but also, equally, if not more important, tied to India’s desire to be, and to be seen, as an extra-regional power moving toward great power status. This argument is elaborated in several parts. First, the report contextualizes India’s interests in Afghanistan within the larger canvas of India’s security interests in its extended strategic neighborhood. Second, it details India’s specific interests in Afghanistan, and third, it draws out the various means by which India has sought to achieve its objectives. The final section draws out the implications for Afghanistan’s future and, by extension, regional security."

A comparison of the use of power, types of power (violent vs non-violent) as well as the outcomes will be presented. Among the units of comparison will include the relative power of the individual to the Russian federal state, the degree of violence or non-violence used in the strategy and outcomes of these strategies."
"September 22, 2010","The conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo are sometimes lumped together as ground-breaking instances of intervention in intractable ethnic disputes arising out of wars in the former Yugoslavia. Yet this straightforward account conceals important differences and commonalities of approach. The wars that gave rise to the contemporary nations of Bosnia and Kosovo were quite different; yet the strategy adopted in each case by the international community was substantially the same. This model involved installing international officials with executive authorities over the territories, whose decisions purported to have the force of law. While these officials used similar methods, the political realities they faced in each territory were very different. Bosnia’s High Representatives faced the daunting task of trying to hold together a nation whose principal political dynamic was centrifugal. Although for some time this task was perceived as successful, it ultimately proved unsustainable. As international interest in the country waned, the High Representatives’ achievements fell apart. By contrast in Kosovo the territory’s natural political dynamic was legal separation from Serbia; in this goal UNMIK was complicit. Yet the Kosovar war had not resulted in the comprehensive ethnic partition resulting from the Bosnian war, and the various international missions in Kosovo subsequently proved incapable of protecting the Serb minorities from ethnic cleansing and violence by the Albanian majority. Both missions displayed pathological traits, including a failure to focus on economic development and inter-institutional rivalries. Now both interventions have faded, and the international community’s efforts in each territory are unraveling. Bosnia looks likely to dissolve, whereas in Kosovo partition and further ethnic cleansing have a grim future inevitability. The common model of international intervention pursued in these territories does not have an attractive track record."
"September 22, 2010","This survey provides an in-depth analysis of existing research on the economic analysis of terrorism and counter-terrorist measures. First the existing evidence on the causes of terrorism is analyzed, then we consider the evidence of the consequences of terrorism and we demonstrate why it is important to regarding of the issue of counter-terrorism policy. Moreover the survey presents the existing knowledge on the interrelation between the economy and the issue of security and it incorporates analysis the level of knowledge about the causal chains between security and the economy. Also it focuses on perspective and methodologies from the discipline of economics but also refers to research from related disciplines (sociology, political science). It also assembles the knowledge on the impact of terrorism on the economy as reflected in macro-economic variables and its impact on specific sectors. Furthermore it assesses how potential an actual terrorist event determine consumer and producer behaviour, public policy, as well as terrorist responses to these policies. Finally a European perspective on the terrorism security annexes is discussed and here we analyze the causes of terrorism in Europe."
"September 21, 2010","The recent report by the National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR), Badgley, J.H. (2004) ""Reconciling Burma/Myanmar: Essays on U.S. Relations with Burma,"" presented a shamelessly one-sided set of arguments for changing United States policy toward Myanmar. This paper tries to redress the balance and to present both sides of the argument concerning what is, after all, a complex and heated issue. Two ""core arguments"" of the NBR report are identified and discussed, and in contrast we develop counterarguments for maintaining, with modifications, existing U.S. policies with respect to Myanmar. We make the case that sanctions should remain in place until there is real progress toward democracy and suggest increased dialogue and engagement with the current regime."
"September 21, 2010","The international community has a declared intention to protect innocent civilians from direct and deliberate violence in civil conflicts, but its track record of actually doing so is mixed. Using a new monthly time-series data set, we explore the factors associated with variations in the number of civilians killed or wounded by participants in the civil war in Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. We find that an increase in the level of abuse by one side is strongly associated with subsequent increases in the level of abuse by the other. Certain types of foreign intervention had a large and statistically significant impact on the level of abuse; some types of intervention raised the level of violence, but others reduced it."
"September 21, 2010","Iran’s nuclear ambitions have brought the country into intense conflict with Washington and its European allies. While the Bush administration actively considered military action, the Obama administration is also considering punitive approaches after diplomatic engagement failed. Given the high stakes of Iran’s nuclear brinkmanship, several organizations have surveyed Iranians to assess popular support for the regime’s policies, including its nuclear ambitions. There are compelling reasons to believe that Iranian public opinion matters in influencing the decisions of the authoritarian regime. Indeed the regime energetically and successfully cultivates support for its nuclear aspirations.  Implicitly U.S. policy also assumes that Iranian public opinions matter. Despite the proliferating surveys, there are few efforts to understand who in Iran supports these policies and why and equally important, who does not support them. This essay seeks to address this lacuna by employing logistic regression, using WorldPublicOpinion.org’s most recent data derived from a national survey of 710 Iranians in 2008. This effort will enable analysts to discern with greater clarity the distance that exists between the regime on key policy questions and the variegated public over which the regime governs."
"September 21, 2010","This paper aims to conceptualize the impact of ‘covert conflict’ on human security. Human security is understood to include key components of sustainable development, namely: political, social, economic, environmental and the traditional security spheres. Drawing on a literature overview of these issues a common denominator framework is formulated to identify core weaknesses and threats in the development of a human security governance system in Africa. Primary causes outlined in the study's covert matrix include: lack of civil society participation in government review processes; poverty and unequal distribution of income and wealth; uncontrolled and unaccountable exploitation of natural resources; lack of financial capital investment in social development; the institutionalisation of preferential entitlements; rights and privileges; and identity vs. issue based politics. The paper concludes by proposing a systemic model to understand the inter-related nature of corruption, organised crime, money laundering, illicit natural resource exploitation and trade, and terrorism: ""The Covert Conflict Political Economy Systems Model""."
"September 20, 2010","Human trafficking is a crime that shocks the conscience and is of grave magnitude that warrants universal jurisdiction. It should also be recognized as a violation of jus cogens, a breach of preemptory norms of international law. A crime that, by its globally accepted definition of “trafficking in persons,” encompasses the act of both child soldiering and sexual exploitation of children. This article aims to challenge the current measures being taken to combat both child soldiering and the sexual exploitation of children, particularly boy child-soldiers in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, both national and international efforts have been insufficient or non-existent for boy-child soldiers who have been sexually exploited in the armed group. The modern human trafficking instruments take a victim-centered approach that is gender-neutral, allowing for successful prevention and reintegration. Triggering universal jurisdiction of this egregious crime will lead to one definition of a child without equivocation and the age of recruitment to be the same without the possibility of reservation. It will lead to more severe penalties for perpetrators, protection for victims, and States cooperation. Further, all States will be held accountable for the protection of children and for the prosecution of perpetrators. All children will be treated with dignity and become survivors."

"September 19, 2010","This brief article quantifies how, in Iraq and Afghanistan, contractor personnel increasingly have made the ultimate sacrifice alongside, or in lieu of, service members.  The enormity of the contractor sacrifice gives pause - more than 2,000 contractors have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.  But what is more striking is that contractors are bearing an increasing proportion of the annual death toll.  In the first half of 2010, more contractors died in Iraq and Afghanistan supporting the war effort than members of the U.S. military waging these wars."
"September 19, 2010","The nature of today’s conflicts has led many practitioners and scholars to suggest that the traditional battlefield – once populated by tank battles and infantry – has been replaced by a more complex environment – sometimes called the zone of combat. When many argue that the United States in engaged in a global war against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, one natural question is where is the battlefield, or zone of combat, in this global struggle against terrorist groups and how do we identify it. This article will therefore focus on two hitherto ignored aspects in the discussions about the modern battlefield or zone of combat – when and for how long is an area part of the zone of combat and how far does this designation extend geographically. These questions are critical for understanding how to apply the law to questions of targeting, detention, interrogation, direct participation in hostilities, and trials, among others."
"September 19, 2010","This Article answers a fundamental question in U.S. counter-terrorism policy: when should a victim of a terrorist attack abroad be able to sue under U.S. laws in U.S. courts? The current principles limiting the extraterritorial application of law fail to adequately reflect the interest a state may have in applying its own law to unconventional national security threats that occur abroad. The three most relevant bases under international law for the extraterritorial application of U.S. anti-terrorism law abroad - passive personality, universal jurisdiction, and protective jurisdiction - fail to tie the application of U.S. law to U.S. security interests. Passive personality, the principle that a state can regulate conduct that injures its nationals, allows victims to sue under U.S. law even if there is little connection to the terrorist act and the United States. The only connection may be that a U.S. national was an unintended victim. Another basis, universal jurisdiction, does not allow regulation of terrorist attacks because there does not exist a general anti-terrorism norm under international law. The last basis, protective jurisdiction, also cannot apply because it only allows regulation of attacks against governmental targets, while most terrorist attacks will target civilians. Instead of attempting to organize civil anti-terrorism law around passive personality, as currently done, the U.S. should propose the creation of a new basis for the extraterritorial application of law that addresses unconventional security threats."
"September 19, 2010","In 1971 Pakistani army carried out a genocide in East Pakistan. According to Adam Jones at Gendercide, “the mass killings in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in 1971 vie with the annihilation of the Soviet POWs, the holocaust against the Jews, and the genocide in Rwanda as the most concentrated act of genocide in the twentieth century.” Unfortunately, it remains little known and studied, nonetheless."
"September 19, 2010","In this study, we look at the relationship of arms races to war, with appropriate consideration of rivalries. Are arms races more common in rivalries than in lesser competitions? Are they merely a consequence of rivalry competitions? How do the patterns of arms races map with those of war in rivalries? We explore these concerns with an empirical examination of rivalry and non-rivalry populations in the 1816-2000 period. In brief, we find that: arms races occur most frequently in the context of enduring rivalries, arms races are more likely in the middle and latter stages of rivalry, the frequency of arms races is higher in rivalries with war than rivalries that do not experience war, and only when arms races occur in the latter phases of rivalries is there an increased chance of war. Our study narrows the scope of the arms race-war relationship relative to past studies, demonstrating that the arms race-war relationship is conditional on rivalry processes."
"September 17, 2010","Terrorist attacks are nothing new, but some venues in which they occur are. During the last decades, airport facilities have been the scenario for some of the most criminal actions committed against civil aviation. This article discusses the current legal scheme allocating responsibility and liability in international transportation, and introduces some concerns about recent legislation that pretends to alter the current status quo."
"September 17, 2010","“Out of Time” unfolds a four box typology of political action based on four experiences of “time.” The horizontal axis of the typology (in Figure 1) distinguishes the possibility of political identity enduring in time from the view of political identity falling into time. The vertical axis distinguishes between political action solely oriented to the future, the source of both melancholy and hope, and political action “authorized” by present or past. Parts I and IX explore this typology. Three historical comparisons flesh this out. The first (II-III) focuses upon the occasions for political optimism and the strategies for coping with political “hard times” through a comparison of the Japanese Marxist Masao Maruyama with the English conservative Michael Oakeshott. The second (IV-V) takes up the “remedies of time” in a comparison of Francois Furet on revolutionary consciousness in the French Revolution with Alexis de Tocqueville on democratic culture in America. The third (VI-VIII) seizes upon the 1929 Davos conversation between Ernst Cassirer and Martin Heidegger to consider the historicist and non-historicist conceptions of action. VI-VIII also explores action anchored in legacy, which leads to a consideration of Hannah Arendt and of Abraham Lincoln as democratic leader."
"September 17, 2010","This article seeks to share lessons from an ongoing six-year project to overcome the barriers to the use of facilitation and mediation (ADR) processes for addressing regional and interjurisdictional planning disputes throughout Southern California. The participants in this effort originally assumed that the successful use of mediation in high profile disputes would lead to greater acceptance of ADR processes by governmental officials. After several failed attempts, project leaders concluded that it would be appropriate to refocus the original methodology and strategy for promoting the use of ADR. The new strategy focuses on the establishment of mediation services for community-based disputes referred to city government. Despite the participation of experienced experts in the field of public policy mediation and an extensive expenditure of time and resources, the anticipated results have not been achieved to date. Nevertheless, participants have learned important lessons regarding approaches that are more effective in increasing city officials' reliance on ADR processes."

"September 16, 2010","The post-9/11 surge in America's Muslim prison population has stirred deep-seated fears, including the specter that American prisons will become a breeding system for ""radicalized Islam."" With these fears have come restraints on Muslim religious expression. Some mistreatment of Muslim prisoners violates the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), which Congress passed in part to protect prisoners from religious discrimination. Despite RLUIPA, many Muslim prisoners still face the same challenges that preceded the legislation. Ironically, while Congress directed courts to apply strict scrutiny to these cases, courts continue to reject most claims. One reason is that many courts are applying a diluted form of the legal standard. Indeed, the ""war on terror"" has justified increasing deference to prison administrators to the detriment of incarcerated Muslims and religious freedom."
"September 16, 2010","Churchill had been given at least forty-eight hours warning that Coventry would be hit. He could have warned the people of Coventry of the impending attack. Yet Churchill determined that any advance warning to the people of Coventry would have enabled the Germans to deduce that their top secret code had been broken. The coded intercepts provided evidence of the Holocaust in progress. Other ways to reveal information that could have by-passed the code system existed, thus providing warning to the public while maintaining a strategic advantage. The international law of genocide would have to develop to go beyond intentional acts to acts of misfeasance and malfeasance. Such expansion would help to close an uncomfortable gap between international law and international morality, for morality and law are symbiotic in the long run."
"September 16, 2010","We live in an age of limited war. Yet the legal structure for authorizing and overseeing war has failed to address this modern reality. Nowhere is this failure more clear than in the recent U.S. conflict in Iraq. Congress self-consciously restricted the war’s aims to narrow purposes — expressly authorizing a limited war. But the Bush Administration evaded these constitutional limits and transformed a well-defined and limited war into an open-ended conflict operating beyond constitutional boundaries. President Obama has thus far failed to repudiate these acts of presidential unilateralism. If he continues on this course, he will consolidate the precedents set by his predecessor’s exercises in institutional aggrandizement."
"September 16, 2010","Existing foreign aid databases – the OECD’s CRS data and now AidData – are project-based. And yet nearly all empirical analyses using these data aggregate to the country-year level, thereby losing project specific information. In this paper, we introduce new data on the geographic location of aid projects that have been committed to most African countries undergoing violent armed conflict between 1989 and 2008. To demonstrate the utility of the new data, we discuss how disaggregated aid and conflict data are needed to capture the theoretical mechanisms in the aid-conflict literature. We then map the disaggregated aid and conflict data in Sierra Leone, Angola, and Mozambique to demonstrate that the new data can help disentangle competing causal mechanisms linking aid to conflict onset and dynamics. The research provides an important new perspective on the connections between aid and conflict. More generally, it is a crucial first step in georeferencing and comparing foreign aid projects to various localized development outcomes."
"September 15, 2010","When the Security Council imposes binding obligations through decisions adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter it may impact on internationally protected human rights and the corresponding obligations of UN member states to respect these rights. Member states are then faced with potentially conflicting obligations. This contribution surveys the respective position of Security Council measures and human rights obligations in the (emergent) normative hierarchy of international law. It defines normative conflict and discusses state practice in order to establish whether Article 103 of the UN Charter is a conflict or a hierarchy rule and whether human rights obligations are subordinate to Security Council measures."
"September 15, 2010","The purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between the increased need for national security standards and the negative impact on constitutional rights and civil liberties of U.S. citizens.  Balance of Power Theory and Balance of Threat Theory as well as the LAMP technique were employed to develop a method for studying the relationship and for deriving results.  Through the Lockwood Analytical Method for Prediction (LAMP) technique, the study determines likely futures based on three scenarios: the U.S. faces a massive terrorist attack, the U.S. faces numerous small-scale attacks, and the U.S. faces no terrorist attack.  After developing permutations for all three scenarios, the likely alternate futures support the notion that the U.S. courts, U.S. population, and U.S. national security community would not prevent alterations to current laws and Acts granting citizens constitutional rights and civil liberties if the threat of attack was imminent.  The study concludes by supporting the hypothesis that national security standards will impinge on constitutional rights and civil liberties."
"September 14, 2010","The empirical terrorism literature has largely overlooked interstate relations when evaluating predictors of international terrorist attacks, opting to focus on state, group, or individual-level factors to explain patterns of terrorism using analytical methods that are limited to either the origin or target of the attack. In this piece we argue that this is both incongruous with the larger conflict literature and limiting in terms of theoretical impact. Terrorism is more accurately considered a component of conflictual relations between two states generally hostile towards each other, which necessitates an examination of both states. We demonstrate, by conducting a series of negative binomial regression estimates using politically-relevant directed dyads, that interstate rivalries are highly robust, positive predictors of international terrorism. We use two different rivalry measures – Klein, Goertz and Diehl (2006) and Rasler and Thompson (2006) – and find that interstate rivalries, regardless of operationalization, explain a greater degree of variation in patterns of terrorism than do established significant predictors such as regime type, regime capacity to project force, or population."
"September 14, 2010","In armed internal conflict, violence against civilians is frequent. For insurgent groups, so-called terrorist acts are an important part of conflict with the state and yet there are numerous unanswered questions about the role and uses of terrorism during these conflicts. This paper examines the causes of terrorism in the context of a larger struggle between a state and insurgent groups. In particular, we examine the hypothesis that outbidding among insurgent groups results in more suicide terrorism specifically and also more terrorism of any type. A global analysis of terrorism from 1970-2004 provides limited support for Bloom’s thesis related to suicide terrorism. An extension of the argument to all types of terrorist attacks provides even less support for an outbidding thesis. Similar to Pape’s argument, the outbidding thesis has received considerable attention in academic and policy circles. But both hypotheses have received little empirical support and suggest that considerable cross-national work is still needed to understand suicide terror adequately."
"September 14, 2010","This paper examines civil war resolution as a path dependent process. It engages directly the idea that peace emerges only as a process comprised of battles, negotiations, agreements, and implementation of agreements. I hypothesize that events at earlier stages of the peace process have implications for later stages, but not always in the same ways. Drawing on bargaining models of war, I consider how two factors that might prevent successful bargaining | stalemates and the number of actors | can encourage cooperation early in a peace process but impede lasting cooperation at later stages. Using a nested dichotomies statistical approach to capture path dependence, I find support for the argument that stalemates and the number of actors have different effects depending on the stage of the peace process. The results substantiate the need in theoretical and policy work to consider peace as an interdependent, path-dependent process."
"September 14, 2010","Using a database of recent articles published in prominent political science journals, we show the rapid increase in terrorism research. Given this increased awareness and attention, we identify several problems that still plague the study of political terrorism including definitional problems, not distinguishing among different types of terrorism, and using the wrong unit of analysis when designing research. After identifying these problems especially as they relate to the quantitative study of terrorism, we suggest some solutions. We then apply these suggestions to investigate whether different types of terrorism, changing the definition of terrorism, or changing the unit of analysis affect key predictors of terror events cross-nationally. One of our tests consists of varying the unit of observation to include directed-dyads, which offers the potential to test some of the many strategic models of terrorism. Our analysis suggests that varying definitions of terrorism, such as military vs. non-military targets, might not be that consequential, whereas different types of terrorism, such as domestic vs. transnational, could be driven by fundamentally different processes. We also conclude that modeling transnational terrorism differently using directed dyads yields new and interesting insights into the process of terrorism."
"September 14, 2010","Old-style realpolitik – bilateral, sentiment-free, and organized by great powers – has returned to Europe, thereby wreaking havoc on traditions of solidarism and multilateralism in the European Union. The renaissance of the Russian state and the rise of Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas monopoly, have produced patterns of international politics that seemed almost inconceivable just a few years ago. Three of Europe’s major powers – France, Germany, and Italy – have cultivated bilateral energy relations with Russia at the expense of a common stance on the continent’s dependence on Russian gas, and much to dismay of other EU members."

"September 14, 2010","Contrary to previous behavior, China recently announced significant unilateral carbon emissions reduction commitments as part of the Copenhagen Accord. Understanding what motivates a country’s desire to commit to emissions reductions is important to policymakers and academics interested in mitigating climate change by inducing countries to limit their carbon releases. One possible explanation for the actions of China is proposed by theories of international socialization, which have shown that international institutions have a socializing effect on nation states, leading them to internalize new roles and norms. Relying on interviews with experts and publicly available documents, this Research Note argues that China’s recent actions can be partially explained through the international socialization microprocess of social influence."
"September 13, 2010","Few concepts in international law are more controversial than lawfare. This essay contends that lawfare is best appreciated in the context of its original meaning as ideologically neutral description of how law might be used in armed conflict. It emphasizes that although law may be manipulated by some belligerents for nefarious purposes, it can still serve to limit human suffering in war. In discussing the current state of the concept of lawfare, the essay reviews several contentious areas, and recognizes the concerns of critics. The paper concludes that lawfare is still a useful term, and is optimized when it is employed consistent with its original purpose of communicating to non-specialists how law might be used as a positive good in modern war as a substitute for traditional arms."
"September 12, 2010","The involvement of communities in the Philippine judicial system contributes further to the considered uniqueness of the legal system in the country which is a blend of civil law (Roman), common law (Anglo-American), religious (Islamic) law and indigenous law resulting inevitably from the country’s colonial past. Aside from religion (e.g. Quran as primary source for Muslim law particularly in Muslim communities), the involvement of communities is a major element of the Philippine judicial system, particularly with communities intervening as mediators to assist conflict parties to reach an acceptable agreement. The pre-colonial traditional practice of dispute settlement through the so-called “barangay justice system” has been institutionalized through the Presidential Decree No. 1508 (Establishing a System of Amicably Settling Disputes at the Barangay Level) in June 11, 1978 by President Ferdinand Marcos. This system involves the “lupong tagapamayapa” (committee of peace) and the barangay captain serving as its chairman, intervening as mediators in the barangay (village) level. Furthermore, the Supreme Court “en banc” resolution No. 01-10-5-SC dated October 16, 200 prescribed guidelines in institutionalizing mediation which promotes a paradigm shift in resolving disputes from the rights-based (judicial) to an interest-based (mediation) process paving the recognition of the importance of community level mediation. Following a pilot test of mediation in the Court of Appeals (CA), the Supreme Court approved the institutionalization of the Appelate Court Mediation in 2004. Furthermore, the courts are required to determine the possibility of an amicable settlement whereas the consultation of the barangay (village) mediation serves as a prerequisite in accepting cases."

"September 11, 2010","This article proposes an engaged analysis of the impact that armed conflicts have on women as well as defining the diverse roles women might conceivably play in peacemaking. Recalling the original theories of international law, the paper recounts how historical chronicles and Western modern authors have depicted women in wartime. Primarily portrayed as victims of brutalization and sexual violence, women have been confined to the private realm and, thus, excluded from the decision-making processes of war and peace. This research argues that the same exclusion has been reflected in the international law instruments that have reinforced the paradigm of women as the mainstays of family honour, rather than as holders of personal rights. Depicted as mere victims in need of protection like children, women have been deprived of any agency for peace. This article identifies the turning point of the indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, acknowledging rape and sexual violence against women in wartime as human rights violations. As a consequence of their new status as right holders under the United Nations Resolution 1325, women were finally accorded the important role of agents in the prevention and resolution of conflicts as well as in the promotion and maintenance of an enduring peace. Nevertheless, recounting the exemplary endeavours of women for peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which ultimately led to the creation of the regional peace women movement Mano River Union Women Peace Network, this article contends that women remain secluded from the decision-making tables in war and in peace. Although they have managed to attain consideration from their own governments and the international community, women’s demands have remained largely neglected at negotiation tables and in peace agreements. This same analysis suggests insights into the lessons drawn from historic women’s struggles, thus honouring the ultimate quest for true change and an endurable peace in the global community."
"September 10, 2010","As the global financial crisis swept the West, China emerged to be the only big economy that prospered in the shadow of the global recession. With the U.S. hobbled in recession, Chinese analysts are engaged in a heated debate over the causes, nature, and implications of the global financial crisis and, by extension, over whether the American hegemony is on the decline. Many are quick to argue that the financial crisis would bode a recession even more severe than the Great Depression, prophesying an end to the American hegemony. Others caution against such a conclusion, arguing instead that the American hegemony will likely to sustain in the decades to come. Concomitant with the debate over the status of the American hegemony is the discussion whether China should “seize the opportunity” in “accomplishing something” (yousuo zuowei)."
"September 10, 2010","Civilian deaths in Gaza often seem to produce immediate conclusions regarding Israeli war crimes and other violations of international law. We often now see similar statements in the aftermath of U.S. or allied attacks leading to civilian deaths in Afghanistan. The increasing use of law as a tool of war - a practice termed “lawfare” - offers a likely and potentially disturbing explanation for the attempts to fashion every civilian death caused by a regular military as a war crime.  As military forces, particularly the U.S., U.K. and Israeli militaries, find themselves increasingly under attack for alleged violations of IHL in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere, one crucial contributing factor is the manipulation of international law - the very principles enshrined in the Geneva Conventions and the customary law - to create an appearance of war crimes and other atrocities being committed by the U.S. and Israel in particular."

Consequently, a review of recent legislation and practice shows that compulsory consolidation of arbitration is fading nowadays world-widely."

"September 09, 2010","This article examines key provisions of Australia’s antiterrorism legislation introduced in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks. Never before in history has Australia witnessed a comparable overhaul of national security legislation and the introduction of laws that significantly curtail civil liberties and fundamental freedoms. A question that thus needs to be addressed is whether or not Canberra’s drastic legislative measures are justified by the severity of the terrorism threat to Australia. It is argued that the actual risk of a terrorism attack occurring on Australian soil is rather low. As a consequence, the Howard government’s antiterrorism laws constitute a disproportionate response that has worrisome long-term implications for Australia’s legal system and its society more generally."

As a consequence the comment argues that a comprehensive and facts-based review and reform of Australia’s approach to counter-terrorism is urgently needed. Any such process needs to be based on the realisation that the risk of terrorism in Australia is insignificant."
"September 08, 2010","The Sierra Leone war, which lasted between 1991 and 2002, gained notoriety around the world for “conflict” diamonds and some of the worst atrocities ever perpetrated against civilians in a modern conflict. On January 16, 2002, the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone signed an historic agreement to establish the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). In setting up a new type of ad hoc criminal tribunal, the parties sought to achieve two key objectives. First, to dispense credible justice by enabling the prosecution of those bearing greatest responsibility for the wartime atrocities based on international standards of justice, fairness and due process of law. Second, to help restore peace and promote national reconciliation in Sierra Leone. Today, as the SCSL completes its last and most important trial (of former Liberian President Charles Taylor) in The Hague, this article uses the stated objectives of its founders to assess whether the tribunal has fulfilled its intended goals. It is argued that, while the SCSL ably discharged part of its core mandate, it also had some serious shortcomings given the limited number of persons ultimately prosecuted and the gross inequality of arms between the Prosecution and the Defense."
"September 07, 2010","The issue whether the recognition of Kosovo as an independent state might serve as a precedent for former autonomous republics of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia has been often debated. This paper aims at comparing the processes of recognition of these three entities. It illustrates that the international community has been gradually recognizing Kosovo as a State while South Ossetia/Abkhazia have been subjected to  the policy of non-recognition. It argues that because the dynamics of recognition of Kosovo and South Ossetia/Abkhazia have been very different, it is less likely that the establishment of Kosovo as a viable state will serve as a precedent for South Ossetia/Abkhazia."

"September 07, 2010","Abstract: Individuals develop causal stories about the world around them that explain events, behaviors, and conditions.  These stories may attribute causes to controllable components, such as individual choice, or uncontrollable components, such as broader forces in the environment.  We employ attribution theory to outline how identities may shape causal attributions about problems, with a particular focus on whom or what is blamed for problems.  We argue that social identities, such as partisanship and veteran status, can predispose individuals take make certain causal attributions over others.  We test several hypotheses using individual level data from national surveys to explain attributions of blame for alleged prisoner abuses in the war on terrorism, including prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison.  Our findings suggest that social identities predispose people to make certain attributions of blame, and some social identities interact with other individual characteristics to shape attributions.  We suggest that attribution theory would be significantly enhanced by better incorporating the social identities of observers."

This layperson's expression of territorial sovereignty also has support in customary international law. However, the legal and factual issues involved in the territorial disputes over the islands of the South China Sea are not that simple. This Article points out that today's leading authority on international maritime law, the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, offers little help to the resolution of these disputes. The competing sovereignties – China and the ASEAN nations – may turn to Joint Development Agreements as a practical treaty solution for the sharing of natural resources."
"September 06, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relevance of ‘switching costs’ to the problem of terrorism and grassroots support of terrorism. Grassroots supporters that choose between the terrorist organisation and the government may face considerable costs in switching their support after their initial decision has been made. This paper presents an analysis of competition between the terrorist organisation and the government for grassroots support within a two-period economic setting. If grassroots supporters face costs, which may be either tangible or psychological costs, in switching to the government if they initially supported the terrorist organisation (and vice versa), economic theory produces results that have important policy implications. Of most importance, it can be shown that when grassroots supporters have switching costs there is more intense competition between the terrorist organisation and the government for grassroots support. Also, when grassroots supporters have switching costs, the terrorist organisation and the government must invoke more extreme measures in order to win supporters away from the other party."
"September 06, 2010","Habeas corpus is the right to challenge one’s detention in a court of law. With deep roots in common law, it is promulgated in U.S. law by the Constitution’s single sentence known as the Suspension Clause. Prior to 9/11, habeas corpus jurisprudence erected a framework of entitlements that vary according to a person’s location, citizenship, and alleged crimes. Plotted on a timeline of American history, many of the landmark cases that progressively articulated this framework are clustered around wartime, and the entitlement conventions that obtained reflected the terminology of traditional warfare. After 9/11, as the nature of warfare and enemies evolved, and the Executive claimed unprecedented authority to detain enemy combatants, Guantanamo Bay became the extraterritorial detention facility of choice. Beginning in 2004, the Supreme Court responded with a series of cases that created a minimal but definite foundation of habeas corpus entitlement and due process for Guantanamo detainees. This article looks primarily at these post-9/11 cases, the traditional notions of habeas corpus upon which they are predicated, and the possible shortcomings they evidence relative to Guantanamo and to other extraterritorial detention facilities."

"September 05, 2010","The study attempts to investigate the various issues related to the phenomenon of religious expression in contemporary Indonesian society with particular focus on the study of the Ahmadiyya movement and its impact on the society. Ahmadiyya movement is considered against Islamic beliefs especially due to its teaching that its founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Prophet and the Tadzkirah is a holy book next to the Qur’ān. The study discusses complex interplay between Indonesian ‘Ulamā Council (MUI) with its fatwā on the prohibition of Ahmadiyya sect, its proponent, the Radical Conservative Islamist group (RCI) and its opponent the Liberal Islamist group (LIG). RCI groups have pushed for imposition of Sharī’ah to solve Indonesia’s multi-dimensional problems. On the other hand, liberal Islamic groups are promoting a liberal-inclusive approach to Islam in society. This situation has put the government in a dilemma as to the most appropriate move to take in dealing with the matter. Moreover, soon after the issuance of the fatwā, a series of attacks on the compounds, buildings and properties of Ahmadiyya centres have taken place. The attacks seemed to suggest to the ordinary people that the fatwā is crucial and timely and they are responsible to implement it. In this context, it is pertinent to investigate in greater detail the central issue in question i.e. the teaching of Ahmadiyya itself, how do its followers understand Islam, how was the “meaning” of Islam developed by the Ahmadiyya founder and his disciples and what are the local socio-cultural factors that might have further influenced their understanding and practice of Islam. In addition, the study also looks at how such an understanding is seen by the above ‘authorities’ and ‘powers’ within the context of Indonesian socio-cultural milieu as well as the implications of such religious understanding and practice on people. This study adopts a qualitative research approach involving both fieldwork and library research. For the former, it uses mainly interview and participant observation as tools for generating primary data from the research site. The study revealed that there are several factors that seem to have influenced the respondents’ decision to join the movement and their understanding of Islam. Among all factors, one element appears to be the most outstanding, that is, some respondents came from families with religious Islamic background and orientation. Their meaning of Islam also seems to be influenced mainly by their own experiences. It is found that there are similar patterns of experience among the respondents which have shaped their meaning of Islam. The study ends with some suggestions and recommendations in its concluding chapter."
"September 05, 2010","Global public opinion has emerged as a prominent issue in international relations. But have U.S. public diplomacy efforts during the post-9/11 period successfully improved foreign publics’ appraisals of U.S. foreign policy? We examine this question by estimating the effects of U.S. high-level visits to foreign countries on public opinion in those countries. We base our theoretical arguments on the political communication literature, but extend them to consider transnational dynamics in international relations. Specifically, we argue that U.S. leaders’ credibility in the eyes of foreign publics is critical in shaping attitudes toward U.S. foreign policy. Empirically, we show that the effects of such visits were initially significantly large and positive, but weakened once the war in Iraq began and international media started reporting negative aspects of the ‘‘war on terror.’’ Most interestingly, we find some evidence that high-level visits eventually exhibited a backlash effect."

"September 03, 2010","U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan in 2010 follow two consecutive years of dramatically increased drone activity within Pakistan. Despite a high degree of interest in the United States’ use of drones in Pakistan, little attention has been focused on whether the U.S. is engaged in an armed conflict in Pakistan, as defined and categorized by international humanitarian law. Although most coverage of U.S. operations in Pakistan focus on the use of drones and the lawfulness of self-defense responses to terrorist and militant groups, it is important to analyze the nature of the hostilities in Pakistan to understand whether international humanitarian law – and its key principles governing the conduct of parties and the protections for persons in the conflict zone – apply to the situation in Pakistan. This article first analyzes the extent and nature of the hostilities between Pakistan and Tehrik-e-Taliban, the main insurgent group in opposition to the Pakistani government. Both the intensity of the hostilities and the level of the TTP’s organizational structure demonstrate that Pakistan and the TTP are engaged in a non-international armed conflict, along with other relevant non-state armed groups in Pakistan."
"September 03, 2010","During times of economic difficulty, a central assumption is that states react by becoming more interventionist, increasing government spending on social programs and public goods provision. However, how true is this assumption in post-war states? For states that are failed or recovering from conflict, the capacity to expand is often not there. Instead, social programs and public goods provision are often the prerogative of the civil society groups and non-governmental organizations, and the assumption of interventionist governments mainly hold true in states that can afford this expansion. However, the recent decision by the Sierra Leone state to provide free health care to pregnant and lactating mothers and children under five suggest that even these countries are playing a greater and more interventionist role in society. This paper explores public goods provision in the context of the health care sector in Sierra Leone and provides an early assessment of the nascent project. An examination of the successes and shortcomings of the program suggests that while definitely a step in the right direction, the government still has much to do regarding health care delivery. It suggests that weak states that attempt to play a more assertive role in public goods provision will suffer from a number of weaknesses in implementation, namely limited government capacity. States recovering from conflict need to spend more time in building state capacity as early adoption of initiatives to boost public sector provision could potentially undermine many of the gains attained."
"September 03, 2010","International relations (IR) theory predicts that uncertainty about rival states' capabilities and intentions presents a formidable obstacle to cooperation. Largely due to this fact, the literature has focused on problems related to enforcement and monitoring - ways of overcoming challenges to this 'partial contracting problem.' However, uncertainty remains an impediment to successful negotiation, even in light of solutions to the partial contracting problem: uncertainty itself presents a formidable obstacle to reaching durable agreements in the first place because it affects how people make decisions. While fear resulting from uncertainty about capabilities and intentions, per IR theory, is said to drive state behavior, exceptionally little investigation has been done into the nature of these uncertainties, the particular challenges they pose, and how such challenges are overcome. Recent work in decision sciences sheds new light on uncertainty - how individuals become uncertain, how they respond to uncertainty and how they make decisions despite it - all in manner that differs from risk and deviates from what rational choice approaches can predict. This paper describes the elements of such an approach to international decision-making and negotiation and applies the framework to the first round of Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) talks. The SALT talks are particularly notable for their high degree of uncertainty, as well as the the successful outcome that occurred despite it. In this paper, decision-making and IR approaches to understanding uncertainty are first discussed, and then issues pertaining to uncertainty in the first round of SALT talks are highlighted for the purposes of generating potential hypotheses about the effect of uncertainty on international negotiations."
"September 03, 2010","Over the centuries, interest in the Arctic and the commercial and strategic potential of its sea lanes and natural resources has been persistent, from the fur trading empires of Rupert’s Land and Russian America to our own time – but climatic conditions prevented the region’s full potential from being achieved before now, holding back its development, and limiting its contribution to the world economy, making it neither a rimland or a heartland but something that more closely resembles what geopolitical theorist Mackinder called Lenaland – named for the isolated Lena river valley in Russia and which captured the unique geostrategic insularity of the Far North, which made it possible for the Cold War’s two armed and often hostile superpowers to come face to face along their long ice curtain with very little risk of war, in great contract to the Central Front in the once-divided Germany where a million men stood armed and ready for war for a generation. This long isolation, that dates back before the dawn of man and accounts for the region’s unique fauna like the polar bear and beluga whale, blending into an environment defined by ice and snow for millennia. What defined the region’s biological evolution also shaped its geopolitical stability, and limited mankind’s otherwise heavy footprint. But all this now looks to be changing, or least the prospect of such a change has tipped from the implausible to the possible – as a result of the rapid warming of the Arctic climate and the measurably accelerated summer ice melts, putting the region in play strategically for the first time since the Cold War’s end."

This paper resolves this contradiction by specifying the conditions under which states opt for either buck-passing or participation."

"September 01, 2010","It is widely recognized that the security of states are strongly influenced by the internal policies of other states. Although states threatened by the internal policies of an adversary often consider the use of coercive instruments to compel a change to the policy, I argue that a dilemma arises in the use of harsh punishments that renders them unattractive and incredible. I analyze this compellence dilemma in the situation where a state is targeted by a violent non-state group that is hosted by a second state. Thus, the security of the state targeted by the group is threatened by the host state's provision of an international base for the group. I argue that although harsher punishments make cooperation with the target state against the group more attractive for the host, they are also destabilizing and make the host a less capable agent in the future. I analyze the compellence dilemma with a three-player infinitely repeated dynamic game in which the actors play stationary Markov strategies. I find that the existence of the compellence dilemma is pervasive in equilibrium and often prevents the target  from utilizing a harsh punishment even when such a punishment would compel the host to cooperate. Concerns about future capacity and group power drive this result."
"August 31, 2010","What factors determine the success or failure of external interventions to influence the structure and composition of foreign governments? We maintain that the core challenge facing interventions intended to prop up beleaguered regimes in foreign countries is that success is dependent in large part on the degree to which the incumbent government can secure the domestic public’s compliance. The Army’s new Counterinsurgency Field Manual, FM 3-24, states that “counterinsurgents face a populace containing an active minority supporting the government and an equally small militant faction opposing it. Success requires the government to be accepted as legitimate by most of the uncommitted middle.”  Consequently, the manual focuses on building the host government’s political and military capacity in order to win the loyalty of the civilian population by providing superior goods and services than can be provided by the insurgents. The problem, however, is that foreign military intervention is unlikely to increase the legitimacy of an indigenous government and could even further delegitimize the government."
"August 31, 2010","As scholars gradually extend social movement analysis to Africa, there is a need for comparative studies on the different ways civil society responds to different levels of repression. In Kenya, individuals and (mostly later) organizations responded from the late 1980s to 2002 with increasingly bold and public challenges to the regime, leading eventually to a ‘culture of resistance’ with widespread participation and finally competitive elections in which the ruling party lost. In Sierra Leone, civilians faced not only repression but regimes occupied by civil war.  Yet at key moments in the Sierra Leone’s trajectory from one-party rule to competitive party politics, students, women, and the general public resisted one civilian and two military regimes through demonstrations, grassroots organizing,  and non-cooperation, helping draw international attention to abuses and increased pressure on the military regimes to step down. In Liberia, where the repression was the harshest of the three case studies, civil resistance involved journalists, women, students, the Catholic Church, and others during the rule of Samuel Doe and later Charles Taylor. This comparative study examines who the actors were, how they resisted, and offers some insights on motivations, including courage, principle, and ambition. In all three countries, repression not only failed to halt the resistance (though it did limit it), it led to continued resistance.  In Kenya, domestic resistance was the critical factor in regime change; international intervention was the key to change in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The study draws on a total of nearly 200 in-depth interviews by the author with key activists and others in the three countries, plus archival research."
"August 31, 2010","Economic sanctions, or deliberate financial and trade restrictions placed on a target state, remain an important yet controversial foreign policy tool used to achieve a set of pre-specified political or economic objectives. Conventional wisdom holds that the effectiveness of economic sanctions is contingent upon the degree of economic pressure imposed on the target-nation state. This claim, I argue, relies on the assumption that a target nation-state is integrated in the global economy. Nation-states with higher levels of economic integration are engaged in and are dependent upon higher levels of international trade. As such these states would have greater difficulty in economic adjustment if their trade was hindered. Expecting this difficult economic adjustment, target nation-states are more likely to capitulate, resulting in a successful economic sanction. Using an OLS regression this study finds that economic sanctions are more effective in target nations with higher levels of economic integration."
"August 31, 2010","States remain a central form of ordering but only one among several. In the transnational space, a wide range of autonomous public- and private-norm producing organizations and regimes operates, which is not, or only partly controlled, by states. The consequence is that the contemporary world is characterized by a multiplicity of overlapping normative orders that rely on different organizational principles: for example, some are territorially bound and some are functionally delineated. Governance structures have emerged as the form through which the multiplicity of orders is linked together. They are inter-contextual forms which simultaneously serve as buffer zones and transmission belts between these orders. As such, governance structures can be understood as institutional mechanisms that fulfill the function of ensuring the societal embeddedness of autonomous normative orders in the wider world through increased reflexivity."
"August 31, 2010","Most accounts of U.S. foreign policy change tend to be unsystematic in their characterizations of what the policy is at a given time and regarding a specific issue or country. A basic reason for this is that specific sequences of actions are glossed over. We propose an alternative, organizational way of characterizing policy based on those sequences and their possible connections to each other; this in turn enables foreign policy change to be understood in terms of various shifts in those connections. Three cases of shifts concerning arms transfers and training, narcotics control, and development and relief assistance are presented; they not only illustrate the different possible shifts but suggest that simple expansion of resources and locations is more likely to be associated with significant foreign policy changes than are other types of shifts such as reorganization and professionalization.

"August 31, 2010","The effect of courts arises through process and precedent. First, the process of selecting cases to escalate in the legal venue reveals information about the preferences of defendant and complainant. A third party arbitrator and multilateral membership adds international obligation and reputation as new leverage for compliance. Second, a formal dispute mechanism may have broader impact if the adjudication of one case leads to other countries reforming policies. This paper examines WTO dispute settlement to assess the role of courts to solve disputes and prevent future incidents. The effectiveness of WTO dispute settlement as a process for resolving specific disputes is tested with statistical analysis of an original dataset of potential trade disputes coded from U.S. government reports on foreign trade barriers. Evidence shows that taking a dispute to legal forum brings policy change and reduces dispute duration in comparison with outcomes achieved in bilateral negotiations. Whether these cases also prevent future disputes is more challenging to evaluate. The paper explores the possibility of precedent effects through analysis of the time trend in frequency of complaints filed by all members from 1995 to 2009."
"August 30, 2010","We present a model of deterrence that addresses why states can credibly threaten what appear to be disproportionate punishments to minor transgressions. In the model the defender is initially uncertain if an attacker's ultimate ambitions are limited or far-reaching. We show that in equilibrium a disproportionate punishment can be sustained by the inference the defender makes from a transgression in the face of the disproportionate threat. The logic underlying our model can sustain effective deterrence even when the punishment is very costly to carry out and the defender entertains only an infinitesimally small ex-ante belief that the attacker has far-reaching ambitions."
"August 30, 2010","We analyze the link between economic conditions and the quality of suicide terrorism. While the existing empirical literature shows that poverty and economic conditions are not correlated with the quantity of terror, theory predicts that poverty and poor economic conditions may affect the quality of terror. Poor economic conditions may lead more able, better-educated individuals to participate in terror attacks, allowing terror organizations to send better-qualified terrorists to more complex, higher-impact, terror missions. Using the universe of Palestinian suicide terrorists against Israeli targets between the years 2000 and 2006 we provide evidence on the correlation between economic conditions, the characteristics of suicide terrorists and the targets they attack. High levels of unemployment enable terror organizations to recruit more educated, mature and experienced suicide terrorists who in turn attack more important Israeli targets."
"August 30, 2010","In this note, I assess the legality of Israel's construction of a security structure as part of its counterterrorism initiative. To place this security structure in a proper context, I provide a history of the Intifada and Israel's recent campaigns to defend itself from acts of terror perpetrated against its citizens. I also trace the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict beginning in the early twentieth century, including the development of a two-state solution in British Mandatory Palestine and the subsequent Arab-Israeli wars that reflected and defined the region's volatile dynamic. Exploring the relationship between Israel and the United States, I evaluate the interpretation of international law principles relative to both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Israel's counterterrorism initiative as enunciated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). As such, I assess the ramifications of the ICJ's 2004 advisory opinion, which determined that Israel's security structure violated international law, and ultimately conclude that the ICJ: (1) embraced a flexible approach toward application of international humanitarian law while inexplicably eschewing such an approach to issues of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter; and (2) created a dangerous precedent for self-defense in an era of global terrorism. With regard to the latter, the ICJ limited a state's ability to defend itself under Article 51 by (a) implying that a threshold level of devastation and destruction inflicted upon the state was necessary, thereby implicitly requiring a valuation of life, (b) restricting Article 51's definition of an ""armed attack"" to state actors and foreclosing the possibility that armed attacks cannot be perpetrated by non-state actors, and (c) preventing a state from implementing  nonviolent means in order to protect its sovereignty and citizens."
"August 30, 2010","Despite being engaged in armed conflict in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the Obama Administration has not articulated its overall views on the law of war or its application to these conflicts.  The most systematic description of its views thus far was given last spring in a short speech to the American Society of International Law by Harold Koh, now the Legal Adviser to the State Department.  This essay examines Koh's remarks in light of other statements and actions by the Obama Administration, and concludes that the legal views of this Administration are close to those of the Bush Administration on crucial  issues."
"August 29, 2010","[enter Abstract Body]In this study, we examine how people’s perceptions on military threat and economic prosperity might affect their political support. In order to explore the nature of people’s political support, we compare people’s democratic support with their presidential approval to see how different factors might affect their political support. We employ survey data conducted on March in 2010 to find that people among the youngest generation, pan-blue supporters, with higher political trust, evaluating cross-Strait relations, and perceived cross-Strait trade benefit national economy tend to approve president’s job. However, people among younger generations, people with higher education, people supporting pan-green camp, and people perceiving military threat from China are more likely to support democracy. Another interesting finding is that people perceiving cross-Strait trade have positive effect on Taiwan’s economy are less likely to support democracy. Therefore, this study finds that different factors affect people’s evaluation toward president and democracy, and people intending to keep distance from China are more likely to support democracy in Taiwan."
"August 29, 2010","The Kyoto summit initiated an international game of cap and trade. Unlike a national policy, the essence of this game is the self-selection of national emission targets.

"August 29, 2010","There is a growing literature on how natural resources affect both economic performance and political regimes. In this paper we add to this literature by focusing on how natural resource wealth affects the incentives of governments to uphold contracts with foreign investors across all sectors. We argue that while all states suffer reputation costs from reneging on contracts, governments in natural re-source dependent economies are less sensitive to these costs, leading to a greater probability of expropriation and contract disputes. Specifically, leaders weigh the benefits of reneging on contracts with investors against the reputation costs of openly violating agreements with firms. Our theoretical model predicts a positive association between resource wealth and expropriation. Using a dataset from the political risk insurance industry we show that resource dependent economies have much higher levels of political risk."
"August 29, 2010","An increasing number of countries are addressing the legacy of past human rights abuse within their borders, and are resorting to transitional justice as a means of doing so. Transitional justice seeks to combine the goals of justice for victims with the objectives of peace, reconciliation, and social reconstruction. Although the transitional justice mechanisms vary country by country, these typically include a high court procedure for gross violations of human rights, trial-type procedures based on traditional justice mechanisms against lower-level offenders, and a truth and reconciliation commission designed to establish a historical record of past conflict."
"August 28, 2010","The Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (LTRC), in its attempt to investigate human rights violations that occurred during Liberia’s 14-year civil conflict, is the first truth commission to systematically engage a diaspora community. The LTRC Diaspora Project was an innovative effort and will likely serve as a model for future truth commissions. As such, it is timely to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the Diaspora Project. This article is a reflection on the author’s experience as a LTRC volunteer in Chicago. Having worked in one of the cities with the lowest levels of participation, I consider some of the local challenges the Diaspora Project faced and provide recommendations on how future truth commission efforts to engage diaspora communities might do so more effectively."
"August 28, 2010","Considering the incentives for multinational companies to invest in conflict prone areas, the paper discusses the decision making process when it comes to enterprises’ foreign investment and operational management of the companies’ units after these are being set up in the respective regions. The research focuses on what companies understand of sustainable management when operating in conflict prone environments and on the enterprises’ specific approaches in conflict prevention strategies. The first part of the article summarizes the primary factors considered by companies investing in conflict prone zones prior to investment in those areas and the specificities of risk assessment plans developed by the companies considering those factors. The second part of the article studies the general aspects of sustainable decision making for enterprises operating in conflict countries while the last part of the paper refers to the corporate conflict prevention as a particular aspect of sustainable management in countries and regions affected by conflicts. Both the theoretical and practical aspects are being discussed considering experiences that corporations have had in such areas. The conclusions aim at identifying the way companies apply sustainable management in operations developed in conflict prone areas and underline the future areas of research that would help better define management systems that corporations may implement in such regions."
"August 28, 2010","Terrorism has nowadays become a world-wide phenomenon. Terrorist attacks on targets in many countries have occurred and continue to occur with depressing regularity. Terrorism poses a real threat to the very survival of humanity and is set to deprive humankind of its most highly prized treasure of peace, security and understanding among nations which are the key underpinnings of sustainable human progress. It is driven by fanaticism and uses increasingly sophisticated weaponry leading to large scale devastation. India is one of the most terrorism-troubled countries in the world. The case of India is unique in comparison to many other countries of the world as it is the country with the greatest number of indigenous, home-grown terror groups along with a substantial presence of transnational terrorist entities on its soil and in neighboring countries, posing a constant threat to its security. This paper has discussed the effectiveness of the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 in dealing with offenses related to terrorism. This paper also includes an overview of the current Anti-Terrorism legislations in India and an analysis of the same."

"August 28, 2010","Recruitment and retention constitute fundamental requirements for any organization. For a rebel group engaged in armed conflict with the state, recruitment and retention of personnel can constitute the difference between life and death for the leadership of such organizations and the organizations themselves. Utilizing a principal-agent analysis of participation and incentive compatibility constraints, we develop a formal model of recruitment and retention in a rebel group with and without contestation. The model better accounts for positive utility from fighting, and is therefore useful for understanding recruitment and retention in a wider set of rebel groups, ranging from loot-seeking organizations motivated by private benefits on the one hand, to groups driven by individuals motivated by communal benefits or highly ideological or religious principles on the other."
"August 28, 2010","The paper I am proposing draws on my earlier analysis of hard borders, violence, fluid identities and political space. Given our contemporary landscapes of mobility and immobility, failing sovereigns and competing ethnocrats, new global actors, and modes interaction, we need to be rethinking our notions of political association beyond container states and fixed territorial spaces. The practices of fixing identities into differential political statuses and arbitrary geographic borders are particularly dangerous as responses to “crises.” While many pundits suggest that it is the lack of defined or secure borders that encourages violent conflicts, facilitates terror-bent incursions, and tempts traffickers to defy border guards, I argue that it is the proliferation of hard borders (symbolic, legal, and material walls, fences, and frontiers) that incites violence, provides mechanisms for domination, and undermines opportunities for peaceful and sustainable political association. In the face of “hard times,” this is not a utopian argument for world government, but an attempt to rethink the relationship of borders, violence, and space."
"August 28, 2010","The relationship between transitional justice and economic development has recently attracted the attention of academics and policymakers.  An emerging literature highlights the tension between the forward-looking economic goals of growth, development, and investment, and the backward-looking trials and truth commissions.  Current research focuses on states’ ability to compete for international assistance or on underdeveloped countries’ efforts toward economic reconstruction following periods of civil war and authoritarianism.  This paper broadens the scope of the study of the political economy of transitional justice by examining the effect of transitional justice mechanisms (trials, truth commissions, and amnesties) on the perceptions of private investors.  Specifically, using time-series data for Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Spain, we explore how stock markets have responded to efforts to uncover information about past human rights abuses and to prosecute those responsible.  The paper draws on a range of data on transitional justice events, and utilizes daily stock market data."
"August 28, 2010","Based on personal experience as imprisoned anti-war draft board raider the role of war in American culture and the Christian tradition is explored.

"August 27, 2010","According to a bedrock principle of international law, the rules regulating the recourse to war and the rules regulating conduct during war must be kept conceptually and legally distinct. The purported independence of the two domains – the ‘separation principle’ – remains unstable despite its historic pedigree. This essay explores recent developments that threaten to erode the separation. The author analyzes, in particular, doctrinal innovations that result in the regulation of the recourse to war through alterations of jus in bello. International and national institutions have incentivized states to pursue particular paths to war by tailoring the rules that regulate conduct in armed conflict. Some warpaths are accordingly rewarded, and others are penalized. The article then explores potential consequences, first, on state behavior involving the use of force and, second, on state behavior involving the conduct of warfare. One significant conclusion is that these recent developments channel state behavior and justifications for using force toward security-based and strategic rationales. These efforts – whether intended or not – risk suppressing ‘desirable wars’ and inspiring ‘undesirable wars.’ These recent developments also undercut humanitarian protections by undermining the mechanisms for compliance with legal norms on the battlefield."
"August 27, 2010","Charles Tilly (2006) provides a usual framework of intergroup dynamics and tension. Tilly classifies the existing scholarship into three alternate approaches: ‘behavioural’, ‘ideas’ and ‘relational’. The ‘relational approach’ elevates the influence of ‘conversational transactions’ between people and groups, such that “collective violence therefore amounts to a kind of conversation”. To relational people then, much is stored in the interactions, motives, impulses and opportunities inherent in social relations to explaining the variability of violence over time. The ‘ideas approach’  emphasises the ideas and actions of the individual in instigating and maintaining violent incidents such that targeted, aggressive policies might “suppress or eliminate destructive ideas”. The ‘behavioural approach’ stresses the role of the individual; factors such as the primal instincts inherent within masculinity, the pursuit of respect from peers and a sense of belonging are considered as core drivers of collective violence. This study continues along relational lines, focusing on the social interactions that cause variations in the tension between and within the communities."
"August 27, 2010","Left-wing extremist movements in the form of Maoist rebellion in Nepal and India, though guided by same motivation and goal of revolutionary change have differed extensively in political outcomes. Why does a similar political movement give rise to different outcomes? It has been largely traced to historical, cultural and institutional variance. However, embedded within the macro-processes are strategic interactions between individuals as rational decision-making units that channels the movement in particular direction. In this paper, I argue that the sequence of interactions between the rebels and the state is important in understanding the differing outcomes of this violent political movement. The division of the Maoist rebellion in India(particularly West Bengal) and Nepal by the Nepal-India border provides an ideal ground to conduct a natural experiment for comparing the dynamics of an identical left-wing movement in different settings. Through comparative case studies, this paper examines the link between repression and dissent and locates it within the spiral action-repression-action cycle. The paper further contends that the differing dynamics of the strategic dimensions at two levels- target selection by the rebels and the use of violence is crucial in determining the outcome of the movement."

"August 27, 2010","The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, headed by King Hussein, has proven itself to be a leader in the recent Middle East peace negotiations. Since the end of the Gulf War, Jordan has diligently tried to regain its previous status with the United States Department of State and the White House. The conscious decision to side with Iraq was a carefully administered plan to reconcile past legitimacy problems and maintain a sense of balance in the Middle East while weathering a global conflict. Considering the dynamics of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and its gains in autonomy, the region in general, and Jordan in specific will predictably see new circumstances. These situations will require a more liberal and modern version of government. Although there is a large Palestinian population, stability is dependent on King Hussein's ability to extend his legitimacy beyond personal ties to include a structural base."
"August 26, 2010","Business and economic ethicists have long resisted focusing their attention on armaments traders. Three unique characteristics of this modern form of economic activity have combined to afford its participants a higher degree of protection: First, perceptions over the industry's national security function; Second, the significant role of the State in providing subsidies and sanctioning trade deals; And third, ethical concerns with the nature of the product being traded. I contend that the study of international relations has much to contribute to the business and economics literature, particularly that critical discourse of international relations which challenges traditional notions of state sovereignty and sources of power. By focusing on a small number of Arab-Israeli conflicts between 1987 and 2008, my doctorate seeks to determine the ways in which, if at all, market actors – including both corporations and asset owners – were constrained in their ability to trade with parties to the conflict.  In handling literature that asks 'what ought to be' however, it is necessary to first establish 'what is'. Thus my research has begun mapping the national and international law relevant to the trade of arms in the said conflicts in order to test the hypothesis that the constraints were weak and few, and that for me to ever contribute to them becoming firmer and more cohesive, the challenging task of interdisciplinary research is before me."
"August 26, 2010","Inter-regional conflict of laws within China under the doctrine of ""one country, two systems"" has given rise to much discussion and controversy. This article first considers the current position of the conflict of laws between mainland China and Hong Kong and undertakes a preliminary theoretical exploration of this subject. Thereafter, the general principles applicable to Hong Kong-related cases under Chinese law are considered. Finally, the article focuses on the practice of judicial assistance between the Mainland and Hong Kong before and after the 1997 handover, and offers some practical suggestions on the evolving framework of conflict of laws between the two jurisdictions. In view of the wide scope of judicial assistance and the complexity of the issue, the discussion is confined to civil and commercial matters, leaving criminal matters aside."

"August 26, 2010","Is there a distinctive American approach to intervention? Contemporary explanations of the causes of intervention focus either on power politics or normative commitments to protect human rights. This paper proposes political culture as an under explored variable in explaining intervention. More specifically, we argue that American political culture, as found in its history and ideology, explains both why the United States intervenes and, crucially, how it intervenes. Building on recent approaches which highlight the illiberal dimensions of American foreign policy (Monten 2005 and Desch 2008), our hypothesis is that American liberalism produces a distinctively illiberal form of intervention, which largely explains why so many American interventions fail. American interventions are characterized by 1) conflicts between professed aims of constructing liberal governments and actual creation of illiberal polities; 2) punitive discourses that focus on individual leaders and regimes; 3) strong aversion to casualties. These three characteristics can be explained, in part, by 1) institutional conflict between the American executive and legislature, leading to a need for grand ideological and threat based justifications that have less basis in local needs 2) ideological assumptions about the natural harmony of political and economic interests both within target states and within the larger international order; 3) an American political identity that assumes ethnic and religious differences can be reconciled through the creation of a democratic constitutional orders. The paper will explore these hypotheses through the following 19th and 20th century American military interventions: Cuba (1898, 1906); Mexico (1914-1918); Vietnam (1959-1975); Panama (1989); and Somalia (1992-1993)."
"August 25, 2010","The quest for a sub-regional standby force for the Horn of Africa was not only timely but also indicative of the willingness of the international community to invest in regional organizations with a view to enhancing their role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The Eastern Africa Standby Brigade (EASBRIG) was established as a component of an African standby military capability. The implications of such military cooperation for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in the sub-region cannot be overstated. This essay presents a cautious defence of regional efforts to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts. If EASBRIG is adequately supported by the international community and the will of sub-regional countries, it has the potential to create and enhance intergovernmental response to conflicts, thereby contributing to regional peace, and to the promotion and protection of human rights."
"August 25, 2010","This project is committed to the notion that an aesthetic engagement with politics can both increase public awareness and offer alternate insights that complement more traditional ways of examining the political. The belief is that aesthetic politics brings a reflective understanding to the mimetic 'reality' often associated with photojournalism and to academic inquiry disciplines in which the project  proposer have been educated and employed. We will employ the aesthetic art of photography to accompany a narrative essay in order to explore the effect of land mines on the everyday lives of civilians and their natural environment. By capturing images of land mines in various states of activity (unexploded, exploded and exploding) in populated, lived areas of Egypt, the project intends to examine whether the success of achieving a total landmine ban in 1997 has significantly impacted the lives of waiting for the mines to be cleared. The project will culminate in an international exhibition as well as the publication of a book titled, Remnants of War: The landmines of Egypt."

"August 24, 2010","On entering the White House, US President Barack Obama aimed to put the war in Afghanistan at the forefront of his security agenda following eight years of neglect by a Bush administration preoccupied by the war in Iraq. The Obama administration spent nearly a year reviewing the situation in Afghanistan and vetting war options amid protracted interagency deliberation and partisan debate. By the end of 2009, President Obama affirmed his administration’s commitment to degrading the capabilities of terrorist groups ensconced in Afghanistan and Pakistan and announced that, by the end of July 2011, the US would begin a conditions-based transfer of responsibility to the Afghan government and security forces, enabling the United States to diminish its kinetic military activities in favour of a more “typical” presence with Washington continuing to providing development and economic assistance, plus training for military and civilian personnel. Thus the counter-insurgency mantra of “clear, hold and build” became, under Obama, “clear, hold, build and transfer.” This paper evaluates the viability of the “clear, hold, build and transfer” approach in light of the structural challenges to each element and the pressure to deliver results in a short time-frame amid difficult security conditions."
"August 24, 2010","This article examines advances in preventing children from participating in armed conflict. It references international human rights treaties, UN Security Council resolutions and jurisprudence from international courts to chart the course by which recruiting child soldiers became an international crime.

"August 24, 2010","How effective is repression relative to more conciliatory counterterrorist policies? The literature on counterterrorism identifies multiple different expectations about the relationship between repression and terrorist attacks. On the one hand, some scholars argue that repression reduces terrorism. Others argue that repressive policies exacerbate grievances that motivate people to use terrorism. Still others expect more complex effects, with certain types of selective repression achieving reductions in terrorist violence. These contradictory findings may result from several key problems with existing counterterrorism data. In this study, we discuss these problems and introduce an original data set of Israeli counterterrorist tactics from 1987-2004 designed to overcome them. The data set, developed using automated machine coding, identifies daily events data on a full range of counterterrorism tactics and policies from 1987 through 2004. This data will allow us to assess the relative effects of the different policies on the trajectory of terrorism against Israel. Although our results are preliminary and descriptive, we conclude by identifying the scholarly and policy implications of our research."
"August 24, 2010","The most prominent of the few stated criteria by which the Supreme Court decides to hear a case is the existence of a conflict among the lower courts. However, a lower court split does not automatically lead the Supreme Court to review a case, and the justices have often allowed lower court splits - and thereby the application of different legal standards across the country - to stand for long periods of time. What explains the Court's tolerance of  conflict, and its eventual decision to resolve it?  We model the Supreme Court's decision to intervene in a conflict as an optimal stopping problem. The Court faces a strategic trade-off between allowing conflict to continue while it learns about the implications of the possible policy choices and intervening to end a costly conflict between the lower courts. Our model provides the first theoretical framework for understanding when and how the Court decides to resolve lower court conflict."
"August 24, 2010","Current literature on the conflict in the eastern provinces of The Democratic of Congo (DRC) tends to focus on the Hobbesian aspects of a decade long war and the impacts on state and society.

"August 23, 2010","The purpose of this chapter is to identify the moral norms applicable to killing in armed conflict and determine whether and to what extent the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and international criminal law (ICL) track these moral norms, justifiably depart from them, or unjustifiably depart from them. Part I explores the moral and legal norms governing the killing of civilians not directly participating in hostilities, both as an intended means and as a foreseen side-effect, and defends one account of these norms against important philosophical challenges by Thomas Scanlon, Victor Tadros, Frances Kamm, and Jeff McMahan. I argue that these moral norms are best understood and defended using the distinctions drawn in criminal law theory between wrongdoing, justifiability, and justification. The LOAC tracks these moral norms quite closely. By contrast, ICL departs from these moral norms in ways that are difficult to defend, in part because ICL seems to mistakenly assign intention a wrong-making rather than a wrong-justifying function."

"August 22, 2010","States, while agreeing to use outer space for peaceful purposes in principle, interpret its use in divergent manners, particularly with regard to non-militarization and non-aggression. The non-militarization interpretation has become completely outdated. Consequently, efforts to prevent space weaponization by the doctrine are fruitless. On the other hand, non-aggression cannot provide justification for space weaponization either. The lack of a specific prohibition does not mean space weaponization is permitted under international law. Relying on the Lotus principle would undermine the international legal framework and instigate a laissez-faire attitude in the international community."
"August 22, 2010","Using the global commons for “peaceful purposes” is agreed upon among states in principle but disputed in substance. While non-militarization has been superceded by the doctrine of non-aggression, the latter, as a necessary rather than sufficient condition for “peaceful purposes”, is tested to its limit by the pressing issue of space weaponization. An international treaty to plug the gaps of the Outer Space Treaty should be negotiated. This would require the prohibition of both weapons in outer space and antisatellite weapons on Earth. The Draft Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects, proposed by Russia and China at the Conference on Disarmament, is an effort in this direction. However, divided views are held on several issues arising from the draft treaty, e.g. the efficiency of the current regime of outer space law, definitions of “weapons in space” and “threat or use of force”, and verification. A primary reason for US opposition to the draft treaty are security concerns over its space assets. However, exercising the right of self-defense is excluded from the obligations of disarmament and this is explicitly affirmed in the draft treaty."
"August 22, 2010","The 2008 Russia-China proposal to the Conference on Disarmament on preventing space weapons has attracted wide attention. Lengthy debates have been made on the need for such a treaty and for two of its most disputed elements, namely prohibition of ground-based anti-satellite weapons and verification. This article argues that, regardless of verifiability, such a treaty is urgently needed for the benefit of international peace and security, and for the security interests of space-faring countries. But in order to serve these purposes effectively, the treaty should at least explicitly prohibit testing, deployment and use of space-based weapons and ground-based anti-satellite weapons. Given the necessary political will, it is feasible to “adequately verify” these constraints. The verification regime should permit the incorporation of new measures in the future, combine international technical means and national technical means, combine remote-sensing technologies and on-site inspections, and be complemented by transparency and confidence-building measures."
"August 21, 2010","One of the most promising emerging levers of coercive statecraft is the ‘reputational’ financial sanction.  These sanctions, recently employed by the United States against Iranian and North Korean banks, aim to chill investment into these countries by threatening the financial reputations of legitimate institutions in an interconnected world.  Yet much about these sanctions remain unknown.  What are the causal mechanisms by which they operate?  How effective are they?  Do they have blowback effects? Using interviews with senior U.S. and European officials, this research systematically addresses these issues with a view to both ground these new sanctions in the traditional debates over the efficacy of such economic statecraft and provide policymakers a better understanding of how the United States and other leading states can use these new levers of coercive statecraft. We find that these sanctions, under a more limited set of circumstances, can be more effective than either comprehensive or targeted sanctions.  Yet even under these ideal circumstances this form of coercive pressure can become problematically disaggregated from diplomatic strategies."

But to what extent is this characteristic reflected in the EU’s civil-military organisation? The EU is clearly not a state, but it does embody certain non-intergovernmental characteristics that set it beyond a “normal” inter-state organisation or alliance, the expansion of the role of the administrative level being one of them. The development of a well-functioning civil-military organisation is important in this regard, but appropriate benchmarks for what such an organisation would look like are missing from the current EU debate. A problem is that, when focusing on the novelty and uniqueness of the EU’s comprehensive approach, institutional change is often treated as a good in itself. However, by contrasting and using two classical models for organising civil-military relations – Samuel Huntington’s so-called “normal”, or separated model, and Morris Janowitz’ “constabulary”, or integrated model – as benchmarks, the article shows that institutional innovations have largely sustained a separation of the civil-military interface, despite the stated objective of developing an EU “culture of coordination”. This situation reflects the inherent tension between a traditional civil-military culture with deep roots in the Member States, on the one hand, and an evolving “in-house” civil-military culture within the Council Secretariat, on the other. When it comes to ESDP/CSDP, certain Member States have used institutional reform as a way to push through national agendas, producing frequent but often ineffective institutional change. At the same time, there has been a lack of attention inside the Council Secretariat paid to effective measures for breaking down professional and cultural barriers between military officers and civilian personnel."

"August 21, 2010","Bennett (2008) introduced an agent-based simulation of insurgencies and governments which modeled the interactions of civilians, insurgents, and soldiers (government forces).  That simulation allowed insurgents to attack government (military) targets, and in turn be attacked and captured or killed by government forces.  When government forces inflicted collateral damage, it risked creating new insurgents.  This paper expands the initial model by adding the option for insurgents to recruit supporters rather than undertake a military attack, and adding the option for soldiers to “counter-recruit” by doing “good works” in the community.  I find that recruitment by both insurgents and soldiers dominates undertaking military action unless government soldiers are both relatively ineffective and inaccurate when responding.  But when soldiers are ineffective and inaccurate, we can see a variety of strategic interactions between insurgents and the government."
"August 20, 2010","We examine how natural resource location, rent sharing and fighting capacities of different groups matter for ethnic conflict. A new type of bargaining failure due to multiple types of potential conflicts (and hence multiple threat points) is identified. The theory predicts conflict to be more likely when the geographical distribution of natural resources is uneven and when a minority group has better chances to win a secessionist rather than a centrist conflict. For sharing rents, resource proportionality is salient in avoiding secessions and strength proportionality in avoiding centrist civil wars. We present empirical evidence that is consistent with the model."
"August 20, 2010","The state parties to the 2010 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference (RevCon) have unanimously drawn Israel into the negotiation phase of a denuclearized Middle East following three decades of 'pre-negotiations'. In preparation for an extraordinary conference to be held in 2012, and in order to obtain universal and meaningful participation of all states, including Israel, this paper seeks to identify which actors and issues are most likely to stymie progress, and which actors or coalition of actors are integral to ensuring the conference is as effective as possible. A review of the international policy discourse leading up to and during the 2010 RevCon suggests that resolving the positions of regional leaders – Egypt, Iran and Israel – is critical to any agreement being reached, and that the coalition necessary to overcome them will involve state parties from outside of the region, as well as international and inter-governmental organizations and civil society. Hence it is argued that a strategic approach in line with existing efforts to ban landmines or that which formed the International Criminal Court will ensure the conference eschews the absurd, for the negotiation of a safer, denuclearized Middle East."
"August 20, 2010","The risk of nuclear terrorism is hyped by some as possible and high consequence (Allison 2006) while others dismiss the strategy as too difficult and too risky for terrorist organizations (Jenkins 2008). However, analysts have no data from which to directly analyze the probability of terrorist acquisition and use. One methodological solution is to extend the range analysis to include analogous cases: private military corporations (PMCs) are one class of non-state actors (NSAs) who may possess the capacity and autonomy to pose a risk of nuclear terrorism for their state masters. I find that the while the technical and military capabilities of PMCs may be greater than those of terrorist organizations with respect to nuclear weapon construction or delivery, they are still be insufficient (and PMCs must also somehow acquire fissile materials). Also, PMCs benefit from agency slack, as demonstrated by Blackwater’s performance in Iraq, but this autonomy does not appear sufficient to carry out an illicit nuclear plot. Therefore, PMCs may be more capable than most terrorist organizations if they sought to acquire nuclear weapons but they are still unlikely to succeed."
"August 20, 2010","From the 1960s, a raft of ‘youth subcultural fashions’ emerged that defy any compelling sociological explanation. Of these subcultures, football hooliganism is one of the most heavily researched yet perhaps least understood.  By redefining football as a violent ritual triggered by similar processes to international conflict, I pose two questions that often plague students of collective violence: what causes variations in the level and form of violence over time, and how and why do participants vacillate between peaceful and violent social interactions? Adopting a relational approach, I argue that a small number of causal mechanisms activate ‘us-them’ boundaries which create, escalate and sustain variations in violence in a variety of settings. Given its social transformation following the Second World War, nationalism is presented as the primary causal mechanism that has informed the violent expressions of football hooligans over time. By refocusing on the social interactions of hooligans rather than their identity, this paper aims to complement existing explanations of collective violence, thereby providing a framework for future cross-national, comparative research."
"August 20, 2010","In this article we approach the functioning of bureaucracy in European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) from a governance perspective that also focuses on informal patterns of interaction between the relevant bureaucratic actors. Following the governance and related network governance approaches, the interplay between formal and informal patterns of interaction can help to overcome deadlock in policy-making and to procure effective problem-solving. This perspective is applied to security sector reform (SSR) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). SSR is one of the major emerging fields of activity within the civilian crisis management dimension of ESDP, that also in the DRC became a focal point in the EU’s new security and defence policy since its inception. However, as the EU involvement in the Congolese security sector reform policies illustrates, coordination and negotiation among European actors to overcome deadlock and produce effective problem-solving is not self-evident or even desirable for all actors. In the case of the EU’s SSR policies in Congo, coordination indeed occurs between the actors that are dependent upon each other in terms of resources and have the willingness to jointly tackle the problems related to the SSR in the DRC. However, it is also often undermined by actors that prefer to engage bilaterally because they possess the resources to do so and the personal relationships with the Congolese authorities to act more efficiently and effectively."
"August 20, 2010","The recruitment of children in Colombia is a war crime contained in national legislation and the Statute of the ICC, of undeniable severity due to the nature of the rights that are affected with the commission. Minors lose their dignity and guarantees, forcing them to participate in armed conflicts, becoming the easiest targets of the fighting. The revictimization of children recruited and the unrecorded crime are common characteristics to such crimes; it is therefore important to strengthen not only the investigation and punishment of those responsible, but also the measures of prevention and resocialization of the minors victims of this crime."
"August 19, 2010","The Coalition Provisional Authority and its administrator, L.Paul Bremer, governed Iraq from May 2003 until June of the following year. During these fourteen months the CPA restored Iraq’s essential public services to near or beyond their prewar levels, instituted reforms in the Iraqi judiciary and penal sytems, drastically reduced inflation and boosted economic growth, began reform the civil service and promoted the most liberal constitution in the Middle East, but failed to prevent the countries decent into bloody civil war. How is this experianc to be evaluated, and what lessons may be drawn for future efforts at post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction."
"August 19, 2010","The more important governmental cooperation and bureaucratic involvement become in ESDP, the more pressing becomes the issue of democratic control of executive cooperation. This article starts from the argument that parliamentary involvement in decision-making is of central importance for ensuring the democratic quality of European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). It uses the notion of a multilevel parliamentary field to examine how parliaments at different levels are currently involved in ESDP. It turns out that during the past two decades or so no clear-cut privileged channel of parliamentary involvement has evolved in this field. Although national parliaments are of central importance due to the intergovernmental nature of decision-making, even they face severe problems in controlling executive decisions as their powers vary widely and both international cooperation among executive actors and military integration pose severe problems to control procedures at the national level. The European Parliament and various forms of inter-parliamentary cooperation complement the work of member state parliaments. While they provide opportunities for public scrutiny of European security policies and for information sharing, working relations among parliaments in the field are not without frictions. The more executive decision-making departs from the purely intergovernmental model, the more problematic the existing arrangements for parliamentary involvement will become. There will be no easy remedy as adjustments in parliamentary control will require careful attention to the relations of the different elements in the parliamentary field."
"August 18, 2010","This article argues that American actions in the Middle East designed to advance democracy and/or ‘moderation’ tend to yield perverse outcomes that frustrate the aspirations of local actors while undermining the values purportedly being promoted by the U.S. In order to explain these contradictions, we emphasize the linkage between policies of democracy promotion and long-standing American commitments both to millennialism and geographical omnipresence. As a result of these policies and geopolitical vision, we argue that ‘democracy promotion’ often devolves into a simple defense of American interest – by producing electoral outcomes designed to strengthen local agents seen as compliant with U.S. regional priorities. In this context, the shift from democracy promotion to a policy of pursuing ‘moderation’ in the region, understood as support for American policies, is entirely coherent.  Commentators tend to present this shift (particularly in the wake of the Iraq War) as recognition by U.S. political actors of the imperial overtones embedded in more heavy-handed approaches to regime change. Yet, the call for moderation is itself profoundly intertwined with American millennial aspirations, while remaining remarkably devoid of clear content and thus equally amenable to manipulation for strategic ends. By way of conclusion, we suggest an alternative basis for a less intrusive American position in the region, one that rejects the need for an overstretched territorial presence and that is grounded in a substantive respect for local self-determination."
"August 18, 2010","If there is one designation that has come to symbolize the complexity of characterizing the struggle against international terrorism as an armed conflict, it is “unlawful enemy combatant.”  For the U.S. military and the al Qaeda and Taliban operatives it detained following September 11th, the characterization defined a group subdued enemy personnel who would be detained to prevent their return to hostilities, but who would also be denied the legal status of prisoner of war and the accordant protections of the Third Geneva Convention.  Operating as a “combatant” without privilege (President Obama has substituted the term “unprivileged belligerent” for these detainees) deprives the individual of legal and moral equivalency with his privileged opponent: state actors.  As a result, the rules established by international law to protect these “privileged” combatants must be denied to the unprivileged counterpart."
"August 18, 2010","A lively debate in the comparative ethnic conflict literature pits those who argue that ethnic fractionalization is linked to civil conflict against those, most famously Fearon and Laitin (2003), who claim that ethnic diversity is not associated with violent civil conflict. The latter perspective is a staple of the mainstream instrumentalist school of ethnic politics, which seeks economic and political explanations for ethnic conflict. Drawing largely on Fearon and Laitin's (2003) data, we instead claim that while ethnolinguistic fractionalization (ELF) does not significantly predict conflict onset, it does indeed predict the incidence - i.e. presence - of civil conflict. This is because indigenous ethnic diversity, i.e. ELF, is relatively static over time, but varies across countries. Conflict onsets, by contrast, are more dependent on short-run changes over time. Little wonder the two are not associated. However, conflict incidents, like ELF, better reflect spatially-grounded conditioning factors and are thus significantly associated. Finally, we note that violent ethnic rebellion is confined to indigenous, or primary, ethnic groups while violent secession is the preserve of politically-conscious national ethnic groups. These findings are more consistent with perennialist than instrumentalist arguments. But this also exposes the limits of the perennialist paradigm: while it can help us identify contextual conditions for conflict in cross-sectional space, it cannot predict when violence will occur."
"August 17, 2010","According to the diversionary theory of war, unpopular leaders generate foreign policy crises to both divert the public’s attention away from the discontent with their rule and bolster their political fortunes through a rally around the flag effect. I argue that the puzzling lack of clear empirical support for the theory may be due to the underspecification of the theoretical mechanism through which the public reacts to the particular issue at the center of the diversionary “crisis.” Because people tend to react to territorial issues intensely, the embattled leader could attempt to manipulate and exploit this proclivity by launching specifically a territorial conflict. By linking government unpopularity with the initiation of militarized territorial conflicts and crises in a global sample of countries, this territorial diversion argument receives strong empirical support. The initiation of fatal militarized disputes over territory is, in addition, linked to economic underperformance."
"August 16, 2010","The recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision on Kosovo marked a watershed in International Law on the legality of a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) and given the present state of armed conflicts and civil wars in Africa offers a perspective on the impact of International Law on resolving these disputes. This paper aims to discuss the ICJ advisory opinion given the background of African intra states conflicts."
"August 16, 2010","Foreign policy choices are dependent both on expected international outcomes and on the factors shaping the power and behavior of the domestic opposition, including institutional rules. Kenneth Schultz’s model of domestic political competition and international crisis bargaining (2001) posits that an opposition's policy positions send credible signals of the government's intentions to adversarial target states. This paper builds on Schultz’s theory, but relaxes his assumption that oppositions have no influence over foreign policy. Instead, we assume that oppositions control some political resources and attempt to influence the government's policy decisions. We find that opposition behavior is predicted to be different than previous models, but is still informative to the target state."
"August 16, 2010","Over the past two decades, international human rights law has provided an increasingly useful framework for interpreting key criteria of the definition of a refugee.  A human rights-based approach to analyzing refugee status helps to increase consistency and uniformity in decision making by state parties regarding who qualifies for international protection."
"August 15, 2010","In the landmark article by Richard Delgado and his co-authors, Fairness and Formality: Minimizing the Risk of Prejudice in Alternative Dispute Resolution, 1985 Wisc. L. Rev. 1359, the authors attacked the increasing use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to resolve disputes because of the risks of prejudice. Using social science research, the authors argued that the informality of these methods of dispute resolution had a negative impact on persons of color. This paper looks at the impact of ADR in the workplace as a method to resolve employment discrimination claims and re-examines the concerns espoused by the Delgado article which has reached its twenty-five year anniversary. In particular, the paper compares the opportunities for formalized resolution of employment discrimination disputes through the courts with the informalized resolution of employment discrimination disputes under ADR.  Using the Supreme Court's analysis in two recent cases, Ricci v. DeStefano and 14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, as a framework for understanding purported post-racial analysis of employment discrimination dispute resolution, the author's thesis asserts that a balance of both informal and formal dispute resolution processes would represent the best possibilities for employees of color seeking racial justice in today's workplace. To achieve this balance, the author focuses on developing workplace arbitration and mediation processes that offer workers of color a fair opportunity for voice and resolution. With this focus, the author searches for racial justice opportunities that will allow employers, employees, and unions to converge their interests to support a comprehensive dispute resolution system."
"August 15, 2010","Exceptionally not grounded on the rhetorical penetration of the great theoretical schemes of international relations’ and foreign policy areas of academic knowledge, but relying, instead, on the juxtaposition of the new Obama Administration’s main electoral promises on foreign policy issues with a series of empirical data on the current state of the world, the aim of these remarks - written in the eve of the Presidential Election of November 2008 - is that of providing the non-specialist with a down-to-Earth introductory background to the future of US’ foreign policy during Obama's presidency."
"August 15, 2010","The aim of this article is to reevaluate some elements of literature on Central Asian regionalism through the prism of contemporary regionalism theories elaborated by international epistemic community of regional scholars. Firstly, it will briefly present contemporary regionalism as a phenomenon and a discipline. It will then advance an analytical framework of regional order. The second part will give a short introduction of post-Soviet and Central Asian regionalisms. It will then argue that the analytical framework presented on the first section should be applied to Central Asian case to make sense of regionalism processes there. As a conclusion, I will argue that we should move from “Central Asian regional integration debate” to discussions around “Eurasian integration space.”"
"August 13, 2010","This is a review of Beau Breslin's book, ""From Words to Worlds: Exploring Constitutional Functionality"" (Johns Hopkins, 2009).  As an antidote to what he believes to be scholarly marginalization of the ""unique"" aspects of a written constitution, Breslin focuses attention on seven functions of such a legal text: transforming existing orders, conveying collective aspirations, designing institutions, mediating conflict, recognizing claims of subnational communities, empowering social actors, and constraining governmental authority.  This review briefly critiques Breslin's functional approach and discusses two of the more pressing goals of modern constitutionalism: managing social conflict and preserving cultural heritage."
"August 13, 2010","I seek to examine the impact of the above-mentioned resolution in bringing about a shift in the security discourse. The Security Council Resolution 1373 has given rise to a ‘national security trumps all’ discourse that has encouraged states to enact extraordinary laws to tackle terrorism. National security and liberty/human rights are placed at opposing ends of the conceptual spectrum within this discourse where rights and liberties of individuals may be surrendered in order to preserve liberal democracy. Taking India as an example, I shall examine how Resolution 1373 has been used by the Indian government to put in place a stringent and regressive anti-terror regime and how these laws consistently undermine civil liberties, even justify it, in the name of national security."

"August 12, 2010","Historically, U.S. asylum policy has reflected both an effort to provide safe haven for deserving asylum seekers as well the intent to promote national security and domestic policy priorities. A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that asylum outcomes, at least in the aggregate, have been weighted more heavily by foreign policy considerations than humanitarian concerns. Since the mid 1990s, the United States government has reformed the asylum system in response to concerns of abuse by economic migrants, burgeoning caseloads, and national security threats. While as Davergne (2008) points out “the most reviled of asylum seekers of the global era is the ‘economic refugee,’ under suspicion of fleeing poverty and poor prospects in search of a better life” rather than fleeing because of the fear of persecution (65), following terrorist attacks on the United States in 1993 and 2001, the fears of economic opportunists abusing the system combined with a broader fear of potential terrorists gaining legal entry into the country through an overburdened asylum system.  Since 1995, Congress has passed two major acts to reform the asylum process in reaction to these fears.  Both the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the 2005 Real ID act were passed to prevent economic migrants and individuals who may pose security risks from entering the country on false claims of asylum. Following September 11th the U.S. government has pursued prosecution for documents fraud among asylum applicants and aggressively enforced safe third-country requirements. And like our European counterparts, the United States has increasing taken more deterrent and preventative actions to discourage asylum applicants from choosing it as a target for asylum and to prevent potential applicants from reaching its ports of entry.  Critics fear that the draconian measures taken in response to these fears are overly broad and worry that worthy applicants have been turned away at the border or denied asylum with increasing frequency, thus, facing the real possibility of torture and other forms of persecution.  In this essay, we examine changes in U.S. asylum policy and whether the heightened security concerns after September 11th have significantly influenced the U.S. asylum process and outcomes in U.S. immigration courts."
"August 11, 2010","Although a truly successful immunization program prevents a pandemic which may or may not happen, lack of government action leads to public outcry.  This paradox adds to the difficult decision many governments must make when facing a possible pandemic: how does a country prepare for something so uncertain?"
"August 11, 2010","States have limited fiscal resources and are forced to find additional revenue sources to pay for wars. With access to inexpensive credit, states can finance wars without overburdening their economies or constituents, and face relatively small short term conflict costs compared to states that have to borrow expensive credit or extract resources directly from society. As a result, states with a credit access advantage will be more likely to win a war against a state with a poor credit rating, ceteris paribus. This paper seeks to generalize previous credit access theories to determine how a state's credit access will affect its prospects in war. To empirically validate this hypothesis, this paper uses binomial logistic and multinomial logistic ordered probit analysis."
"August 11, 2010","One of the most established approaches to explain attitudes towards immigration is group conflict theory. However, even though the theory was originally articulated in dynamic terms, previous research has almost exclusively tested it through cross-sectional analyses. Our aim in this paper is to disentangle the dynamic and context-dependent character of ethnic competition from more permanent and structural perceptions of ethnic threat. We do this by estimating fixed and randomeffects logistic regression using the German Socio-Economic Panel. Our findings suggest that a remarkable variance of anti-immigrant attitudes, attributed in previous research to structural positions of social-economic vulnerability, almost vanishes when temporal within-individual variance is modelled. More specifically, a real (rather than expected) and involuntary economic shock like becoming unemployed and being fired has a strong effect on concerns over immigration. Moreover, this effect does not differ across social class."
"August 11, 2010","Given that international military interventions provide both the opportunity and willingness for the adoption of transnational terrorist tactics, these military encroachments provide an ideal environment in which terrorism can flourish. However, military interventions’ exacerbating effect on terrorism should depend on the intensity - perceived in terms of troop size - of the intervention in question.  In particular, very low-scale and very high-scale military interventions should have little or no effect on transnational terrorism, while interventions of intermediate intensity should have a statistically significant positive effect. The reasoning for this hypothesis is drawn from resource-mobilization theory in which it is posited that the potential for political violence results from a group’s ability to mobilize resources in support of collective action. A cross-sectional, time-series data analysis of 165 countries from 1968 to 2005 reveals that, when military interventions are categorized according to intensity, only those with moderate numbers of troops are consistent, positive predictors of terrorism.  n policy terms, these findings suggest that transnational terrorist violence may be mitigated through a policy of military restraint or overwhelming military force."
"August 11, 2010","Without understanding a politics of mourning, it is difficult to understand why some deaths lead to political change while others do not. Of the hundreds of black men lynched in Mississippi, Emmett Till’s death stands out. Why? The context of a long history of extralegal violence and the political uncertainty generated by Brown v. Board combined with a still-inchoate civil rights movement that publicized and capitalized on Till’s death to generate a nationally-significant moment of mourning that drew formerly reluctant observers into the fray. Although Till’s killers and the jury that acquitted them meant to quell these anxieties, their actions clarified the rest of the nation’s resolve to address them."
"August 11, 2010","Political science students face the difficult challenge of understanding the obstacles to resolving intrastate conflict. Often, instructors will use negotiation-based role-playing simulations to model arduous discussions between the warring groups and intervening parties. However, the long-term challenges of directing peacebuilding and ensuring security are equally important parts of intrastate conflict resolution that remain unaddressed in current simulations. The design of simulations with board game-like rules for teaching about intrastate conflict has also been unexplored. This paper lays out a new type of simulation with board game-like rules that present realistic obstacles to students as they try to balance the various needs of their assigned state. A detailed discussion of the significance of each of the game rules and potential applications of the simulation are included."
"August 11, 2010","This paper has two major parts. First, the work of a Review Committee appointed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) to evaluate the CIA's estimates of Soviet military spending is evaluated. The Review Committee's criticisms are presented in detail and, in general, they expressed “… serious reservations about certain methodologies and reporting styles …” which resulted in CIA estimates of Soviet military spending that were too high. The Review Committee's criticisms, while in the right direction, were deemed to be too lenient.In the second part of the paper, it was argued that the CIA's exaggerated estimates of Soviet military spending led to excessive military spending by the United States. An attempt was made to show that over the 1979–1988 decade, we spend between $500 and $800 billion dollars more than was warranted. Moreover, in 1988, budgeted military expenditures were about $80 billion higher than was warranted and stockpiles of materiel were similarly excessive. Under these circumstances, and in light of the ending of the cold war, the case for sharp cuts in military expenditures should have been overwhelming."
"August 11, 2010","These last twenty years, from 1989 until 2009, the number of major armed conflicts has been declining significantly. Interstate wars and civil wars have been lower in number across the period and, despite their brutality, these conflicts have killed fewer people compared with major conventional wars. Why? Why is it that wars at the beginning of the Twenty-First century have been comparatively more limited and restrained? Taking as a starting point the key Clausewitzian insight that the conduct war is shaped in part by the domestic societal and political make-up of polities, I explore the idea that the wars and strategies of the last twenty years, from 1989 until 2009, have been affected by the overall decline of popular participation in politics and in war."
"August 11, 2010","The United States has had economic sanctions in place against Cuba for over fifty years.  During that time, Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba has received substantial amounts of trade and assistance from a diverse array of third parties, including: the Soviet Union, China, Spain, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and Venezuela.  Despite all the works that have addressed to the issue of sanctions efficacy, few have examined why spoiler states emerge and the role they play in affecting sanctions’ outcomes.  Thus, no explanation really exists for why all these states deliberately undermined the United States’ sanctions against Cuba.  This study conducts a comparative analysis of the more than ten states that engaged in extensive sanctions-busting trade on Cuba’s behalf from 1960-1974 and 1991-2006.  It seeks to uncover why some sanctions busters were profit-driven, while others provided Cuba with costly assistance.  The analysis indicates that states’ political ideology can motivate them to engage in costly sanctions-busting, which constitutes a causally distinct explanation for sanctions-busting than the profit-driven account.  The study also reveals major shortcomings with how previous analyses have accounted for the effects of third party assistance and how third party behaviors change over time.  The results suggest that U.S. policymakers should abandon their sanctions against Cuba, as they are unlikely to ever obtain their objectives."
"August 11, 2010","How do some small, proto-insurgent groups grow to become large revolutionary organizations composed of thousands of members while others are easily destroyed by government counterinsurgency (COIN) campaigns?  I argue that the development or decline of proto-insurgencies is largely dependent on the intersection of the strategic choices made by both governments and nascent rebel groups. In my framework, both governments and proto-insurgent organizations can choose between three primary strategies intended to advance their interests: The first is a hearts-and-minds campaign intended to obtain popular support through political reform and the provision of public goods to citizens. The second is a targeted military campaign, in which armed soldiers from one side target only their adversary’s armed combatants. Finally, either or both combatants can employ a terrorist campaign by threatening or attacking innocent civilians in order to deter them from supporting the other side or to coerce them into providing tactical intelligence or material assistance. A new data-set compiled for this inquiry maps the strategy alterations used by more than 150 governments and proto-insurgencies. It also tracks the change in size of these groups and suggests that they generally grow as the result of two types of strategic intersection:1) When rebels select a hearts-and-minds strategy and governments respond with a strategy of terrorism; 2) When rebels select a strategy of terrorism and governments respond with a hearts-and minds strategy."
"August 11, 2010","The Obama administration decided in December of 2009 to commit 30,000 additional troops to the war in Afghanistan. The decision was apparently inspired to some extent by the apparent success of the surge (and COIN) strategy in the war in Iraq adopted in 2007. Foreign policy decision makers seem with some regularity to base decisions in important part on historical precedents and analogies."
"August 11, 2010","Few leaders worry about the status of their honor; they do worry, at times obsessively, about their credibility.  The “credibility imperative” has occupied a central position in every major U.S. foreign policy debate in the last fifty years.  It affects discourse and decisions in predictable – and deeply pathological – ways.  This paper examines the continuing importance of honor in modern U.S. foreign policy.  It first discusses the traditional importance of honor in international and interpersonal politics, and explains of the central role it plays in the construction of security in any system that lacks a central authority.  Second, it describes the predictable, consistent effects that honor has on state behavior in general, and U.S. foreign policy in particular.  Third, it argues that the lingering concern for honor is pathological, for a couple of reasons:  There is no evidence that it helps states attain their goals, and it certainly has no relevance in those systems (like today’s international) where no existential threats to member security exist.  The paper then speculates about the genesis of the honor pathology, and why it continues to have such salience in the new century.  Honor as a motivation for action seems as anachronistic today as horse-drawn carriages, alchemy and the duel.  But it persists, if under different guises; and to the extent that it persists, it pathologizes."
"August 10, 2010","This article compares the conflicts in Colombia and the North Caucasus. This  article argues that there are similarities in the nature of the conflicts. The  Colombian period of La Violencia began with two parties to the conflict. After  La Violencia, new groups, guerrillas, entered the conflict which prompted a response from the Colombian military. In turn, these dynamics gave rise to the  paramilitary organisations. In the North Caucasus, the First Chechen War was fought between two parties: the Chechen government and the Russian Federation. This conflict also evolved to include warlords, terrorists, separatists and insurgents. Both conflicts experience circular violence and in both instances, there is a strong degree of state clientelism present, which hampers the installation of effective rule of law."
"August 10, 2010","The US, as a champion of human rights abroad, has often been skeptical and even critical when other states have granted de facto amnesty allowing impunity for gross violations of human rights. Nonetheless, some now argue that the US should turn a blind eye to the evidence indicating that under the Bush Administration US government officials formulated and implemented a policy of torture. Naturally, arguments about US national security have been central to the debate. The CIA’s own reports insist that enhanced interrogation techniques have been effective in yielding valuable information vital to the national security of the United States, but the utility of torture, is subject to question."
"August 09, 2010","Do attacks against nuclear programs delay the target state’s ability to acquire nuclear weapons?  If so, how are they effective? The standard account of military strikes against suspected proliferators’ nuclear installations presents a stark picture: they either work or do not.  History tells a far more complex story. In this study of all 16 attacks against nuclear programs since 1942, we find that strikes are neither as uniformly fruitless as the skeptics would suggest, nor as historically successful as advocates have claimed. As this analysis shows, strikes can sometimes buy time for the attacking state by (1) destroying facilities that are crucial to weapons development; (2) causing a shift in the target’s strategy to acquiring the bomb; (3) reducing the willingness of foreign suppliers to offer assistance; and (4) subjecting the target state to more comprehensive international inspections.  However, over half of the historical attempts have ended in failure either because of inadequate intelligence or operational failure. Moreover, the circumstances in which force might buy time are increasingly restricted because target states learn from previous attacks and take precautions that make them less vulnerable to future strikes."
"August 08, 2010","States increasingly rely on self-defence to justify forcible measures against terrorists. It seems agreed that when so doing, they must comply with the traditional conditions of necessity and proportionality. The application of these two principles to anti-terrorist self-defence raises a number of complex issues. drawing on a detailed examination of case studies, the present paper addresses these issues and suggests how necessity and proportionality can be applied meaningfully."
"August 06, 2010","International companies and law firms increasingly look to the Middle East to invest and conduct business. Arbitration is often an excellent way to resolve disputes for these types of investments, but many investors feel anxious about the legal structure and application of local arbitration laws. This article addresses some of the most prominent national laws, demonstrating their differences and roots in Arab and Islamic history."
"August 06, 2010","Efforts to contain piracy in the Gulf of Aden, a spot of bother for shipping lines and many other stakeholders in maritime trade due to the high number of pirate attacks in the strategic waterway, have been lauded as much as criticized. The presence of multinational forces in the area, under the ‘blessing’ of a United Nations resolution to fight piracy in the Gulf, can potentially trigger new strategic and geopolitical dynamics that may affect other similar sea lanes. Concerns are also growing if the ‘vigilante’ approach of the foreign navies to confront the threat of piracy in the waters will just address the symptom and not the root cause of the problem. This paper discusses these issues and calls for a holistic approach to effectively neutralize the threat by addressing the land-based issues that have created political chaos in Somalia and the socioeconomic factors driving people to take to the sea and carry out their dirty deeds."
"August 06, 2010","Previous research assumes that the factors influencing settlement are largely fixed at filing: once the complaint is before a particular judge, the die is cast.  We relax that assumption and investigate how the parties actively participate in the process by which they come to understand their cases and agree to private resolutions. Using federal district court docket-level data, we find that the mere filing of a motion speeds case settlement, granted motions are more immediately important to the settlement rate than motions denied, and plaintiff victories are more important than defendant victories.  We also test a variety of case-specific effects.  These results open up a new area of research into the pro-social effects of litigation."
"August 06, 2010","This century has witnessed a lot of Muslim terrorist acts. Therefore, lots of articles and books have been written on the topic. Hundreds of debates have also been aired on radio and television. This paper is yet another source of information on the subject - Muslim terrorism worldwide. The paper intends to show that we can indeed increase our perception of the terrorists when we read such works. True, all these writings are different but they add to our knowledge of Muslim terrorism that we are facing in this new century and enable us to try to understand who are the terrorists and why they decide at a certain point in time in their lives to commit such drastic acts."
"August 05, 2010","Counter-terrorism measures offer a compelling example of how a fearful public, nervous politicians and exceptional events can combine to create alchemies ill-suited to the process of effective policy development. Given recent events, experts and legislators can expect to face these dynamics as people call for tighter remittance regulations. In the wake of Faisal Shahzad’s arrest in connection with the foiled plot to bomb New York’s Times Square, this article suggests there should be no new regulations as a number of fundamental problems remain unaddressed."
"August 05, 2010","Despite the significance of the Taiwan issue to US-China relations as well as regional stability in the Asia-Pacific, one could hardly find a comprehensive and thorough study of China's Taiwan policy. This book aims to make up for the deficit by providing a systematic and in-depth analysis of the evolution of China's Taiwan policy over the past six decades, against the backdrop of a three-player game involving Beijing, Washington and Taipei. The intention is to show that despite Beijing's uncompromising adherence to the One-China principle, China's leaders have maintained remarkable flexibility in interpreting and implementing it. Moreover, while domestic factors (e.g., nationalistic sentiment, political stability, and economic development) do affect Beijing's calculus, China's Taiwan policy invariably accords with the ups and downs in its international environment, especially the complexities of the US-China relations."
"August 05, 2010","Frederich Nottebohm was the subject of a famous 1956 International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision that still has resonance today. The story of how Mr. Nottebohm, a wealthy German-born businessman living in Guatemala, came to be the subject of a case before the world court exposes a little known program run by the United States during World War II in which the United States pressured Latin American countries like Guatemala to identify persons of German nationality or ancestry and turn them over to the United States for internment for the duration of the war. Many of these persons were assumed to be Nazi sympathizers and were arrested and detained for lengthy periods of time on the basis of mere accusations unsupported by any real investigation or evidence. Sadly, as with the Japanese-Americans who were forced into detention camps during World War II, U.S. law at the time allowed these arrests and detentions of persons with German connections with little or no proof of Nazi sympathies, much less subversive activities."
"August 04, 2010","In the aftermath of the horrific Mumbai terror attacks and resultant siege in the heart of India’s commercial capital in November 2008, the ruling UPA government quickly pushed through two significant pieces of legislation. First, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2008 (UAPA) and second, the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (NIA). For a start it is debatable whether such new laws were necessary to stop eleven odd men from making their way through naval and coast guard patrolled waters in a dinghy. Presumably, the entities that are meant to guard the waters and the hotels that had apparently been warned about a possible strike, do not need legislation to follow intelligence briefings."
"August 04, 2010","This monograph, a sequel to the author's highly successfull “A Mathematical Treatment of Economic Cooperation and Competition Among Nations: With Nigeria, USA, UK, China and Middle East Examples” (Academic Press, 2005), extends the study to all member states of the United Nations. It derives the equations of the key economic variables of gross domestic product, interest rate, employment value of capital stock prices (inflation) and cumulative balance of payment. The derivation is based on the differential market principle of supply and demand and on the rational expectation principle. The models are validated using economic time series of each country and MATLAB programs. The emerging dynamics is a differential game of pursuit which is converted to a hereditary control system for a single nation. Following the same method we derive the full hereditary economic model of all members of the United Nations joined together by external trade, investment capital flow consumption employment and governments' economic intervention - all mirrored by interacting gross domestic products. The system is validated with IMF and World Bank data."
"August 03, 2010","Two female American citizens, Colleen LaRose, a.k.a. “Jihad Jane” and Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, whose appearance and passports allow them to blend into Western society, currently represent “one of the worst fears” of intelligence and FBI analysts who work to identify terrorist threats. On both sides of the Atlantic, similar problems exist of homegrown terrorism and radicalization, and the internet has a huge impact on these issues."
"August 03, 2010","Partition of India in 1947 was a tragedy of grave proportion which left a permanent scar on our minds and hearts. It was the result of very complex political problems involving several actors and stakeholders. However, as the dispute was between sections of two communities and ideologies, matters were simplified in communal propoganda and one community was held responsible for partition, which is far from true. Political leaders, intellectuals and sensible citizens from both the communities opposed partition and articulated their views. Maulana Azad was not only a senior Congress leader but also a great scholar of Islam and statesman of great vision. He opposed the partition and very well understood its long-term implications, which he spelt out in his seminal work India Wins Freedom. This paper is based on his views."
"August 03, 2010","Plastic Power introduces a new, post-cartesian view of the theory of international politics. In the quest to overcome the tradition of rational-materialistic philosophical politics, inherited from intellectuals such as Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli and Morgenthau, the recent incorporations of post-positive thinking gives birth to a symbolic non-materialistic tradition.  Plastic Power analyses the material and symbolic dimensions of human life in pursuit of the ultimate essence of power."
"August 03, 2010","State failure is not a new phenomenon, but the prevention and the overcoming of state failure have just only recently become a concern of the international community. The worst case scenario, a total state collapse, remains the exception, but if it does occur, it has grave consequences not only for the local population, it also poses a serious security threat for neighbouring countries. Since 9/11, monitoring of fragile states has also become an imperative to prevent private entities from utilizing the domestic power vacuum for their own criminal aims, e.g. transnational organized crime or international terrorism. From the international law perspective, preventive measures of well-meaning third states do not take place in a legal vacuum: the sovereign equality of states and the principle of non-intervention limit the imposition of preventive state-building measures upon fragile states, and reconstruction efforts after a state has collapsed have to comply with the law of occupation and the people’s right of internal political self-determination. However, a balanced view is required as to the principle of self-determination, so as to avoid legal “birth defects” of a revived state sowing the seed of the next state failure."
"August 03, 2010","The partition of India is one among the top ten tragedies in the homo-sapien history. Partition of India wobbled from communal to economic edges, translated itself into geographical boundaries from geographical distances, moved from sensitive to the strategic factors. It divided not only the Hindus and Muslims living together for ages, not only struck the cultures and caused the greatest migration ever, but this ‘divide and relinquish’ policy led to the endless boundary disputes. The Radcliffe Line devised by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, which equitably divided 175,000 sq miles of territory among 88 million people, became the border between India and Pakistan. It managed to provide international entity to the two countries - India and Pakistan, but it failed to draw a geo-politically sound line, though it made a perfect line as a political cover, it had long lasting repercussions with regard to mass violence and frequent conflicts. Apart from the tremendous dislocation of inhabitants of the two nations, there is a watermark of dispute in the partition history. Since the boundaries were made without any understanding of impact of resource partition, this led to the fact that water issue has stoked tensions between the two nations. The watermarks of partition are too deep and intense to remove the conflict between the two nations and so it is essential to understand all linkages with water. The paper aims at understanding the footprints of the past and suggesting the strategies for future."

"August 02, 2010","Macedonia experienced a short conflict between the Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA) and the Macedonian security forces, which took place between February and August of 2001. The following examination of the outcome of the international intervention encompasses the issues of democracy, state capacity, and security."
"August 02, 2010","The republic of Yemen born in 1990 from the union of the South and the North is threatened by a multidimensional internal struggle for power, dramatized by the increasing involvement of al-Qaeda and Iran. In this struggle, the tribes have so far succeeded to prevail on the central government, making of their occult alliances to radical Islamists and the kidnapping of foreigners the core of a merchant-like bargaining with the government. In this article, the author shows how this behavior has settled new rules in the political and social life of this country and how it may grow to threaten the state itself and undermine its supports, if the “law” of the tribe is allowed to dwarf the state."
"August 01, 2010","This paper attempts to examine the impacts of the extent of the external debt problem and its sustainability on the government’s efforts to reduce poverty and sustain growth and peace in the Sudan. It starts with defining the concepts of external debt and types of loans and then examines the details of the external debt profile, magnitude, composition and sources by creditors. It also lists the causes (both external and internal) of the debt problem in the Sudan. A major section of this paper is devoted to investigate the relationship between growth, debt and peace in the Sudan in order to generate some policy based recommendations to deal with the issues of poverty and growth in the country. The remaining sections discuss various issues pertaining to debt burden indicators, debt sustainability, the Sudan debt relief strategy for solving the problem of external debt in the 1980s, and the new borrowing and investment policies. The final section gives some conclusions and policy recommendations."
"August 01, 2010","This article reviews a series of recent international legal regimes in post-conflict countries that conferred upon international officials executive authorities to override countries’ domestic institutions. The focus is on the regimes in the Balkans (Bosnia and Kosovo) but Cambodia, East Timor and Iraq are also considered. The levels of probity and wisdom with which such powers have been exercised are very mixed. The model these offices have followed is one of military government, by its nature absolutist, and so far these powers have not been subject to effective check or review. This has undermined international law, as civil rights are eroded or international mandates spin out of control. The article concludes with tentative suggestions for a review mechanism of the decisions of such officials."
"July 31, 2010","When violence has ceased it is often assumed that from this very moment peace has been restored. Definitions of peace and war have influenced earlier peace building interventions which in turn constituted the simple act of putting the weapons down as sufficient. Only recently have attempts to incorporate wider angles of facilitating peace and development been utilised. Critical approaches enhancing the perception of peace are put forward by Peace Theory scholars such as Johan Galtung and actual lessons learned serve to counter prevailing criticsm from Realist perspectives on peace. This paper demonstrates a rationale and case for supporting a more promising as well as more realistic view of peace and conflict management offered by peace theoretical considerations and approaches."
"July 30, 2010","Since the late 1980s to 2006, the northern region of Uganda underwent an armed conflict between the government of Uganda and the rebel group led by Joseph Kony. The conflict displaced virtually the entire population in the region, and by 1990 people were living in Internally Displaced peoples’ camps. As the war winds up, many people have left the camps returning to their former villages. The journey back home has not been easy, however. For women in particular, many are facing a lot of challenges especially related to access, ownership and use of land. Using data that was qualitatively gathered in two IDP camps in Gulu district, northern Uganda, the paper examines these challenges. It argues however that despite the challenges, opportunities do exist that can be exploited, if there is commitment by various stakeholders, to ensure that women access, own and use land in the return process."
"July 30, 2010","Based on in-depth interviews with former child soldiers in Colombia, this article presents the findings from fieldwork conducted among demobilized child soldiers in Colombia. The findings add to the state of knowledge by going in-depth into the circumstances surrounding the processes and mechanisms of recruitment of children and adolescents into armed groups. The former child soldiers had generally joined the armed groups voluntarily. However; one of the challenges with a strong division between ‘voluntary’ and ‘coerced’ recruitment, is that it indicates a sharp dichotomy between two very different situations. This article argues that most cases of recruitment takes place in the grey zone between voluntary and coerced recruitment. However, the demobilization policies work under the assumption that even when the children classify themselves as voluntarily recruited it is considered force due to children’s inability to make a free or conscious choice. This indicates that demobilization programs are based on an assumption that is incorrect. The former child soldiers, both girls and boys, were affected by their involvement in the conflict. They did not, however, constitute a homogeneous group of passive victims, but rather a group of vital agents each one with their choices shaped by their particular experiences and circumstances."
"July 30, 2010","The conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, opposing Armenia and Azerbaijan, is the longest conflict in the OSCE area and a fundamental security threat to the South Caucasus and surrounding regions, preventing full and inclusive economic development and constraining regional relations. This chapter takes the ENP as a conflict transformation tool and looks at how the EU has used this initiative to reach civil society organisations (CSOs) and improve their performance as peace-builders in this protracted conflict. Building on the theoretical framework presented by Tocci (2008), the chapter assesses EU involvement in the civil society domain, mapping the types of organisations privileged by the EU and the potential impact of their activities on the conflict. It puts forward relevant arguments regarding the suitability of the EU’s goals and instruments to the dynamics on the ground and concludes with a categorisation of the EU’s approach according to three hypotheses: The Liberal Peace, the Leftist Critique and the Realist hypothesis. It is argues that work with civil society is a crucial part of the EU’s approach, despite the difficulties of making such engagement a central part of its peace-building and conflict transformation activities."
"July 30, 2010","Indian reserved water rights have a strong legal foundation buttressed by powerful moral principles.  As explained more fully below, the Supreme Court has found implied reserved rights when construing treaties and other legal instruments recognizing or creating tribal reservations when access to water is necessary to fulfill the purposes behind establishing the reservation. The precise scope and extent of these rights in any treaty are unknown until quantified by a court ruling or an agreement ratified by Congress. When litigation is the quantification tool, tribal claims are generally caught up in massive general-stream adjudications. These adjudications are massive because to obtain jurisdiction over the Indian water rights (and over the United States as trustee to the tribes), states must adjudicate all claims to a given river system; they may not engage in piecemeal litigation of only the Indian and federal claims. The result can be that there are thousands of state water right holders who must be joined as parties to exceedingly complex litigation that takes too long and costs too much. Moreover, even when such adjudications are litigated to a conclusion and tribes win a decreed water right, such a “paper right” may do little to advance tribal needs without the financial ability or the infrastructure to put the water to use.  At the same time, the general failure of the United States to assert and protect tribal rights until the 1970s, along with its zealous advancement of competing non-Indian uses, created expectations among non-Indians that their state-law water rights were secure. In fact, many non-Indian rights are far from secure."
"July 29, 2010","As is well known, the amount of aid given by international donors both to Israel and to the occupied Palestinian Territories (oPt) is unparalleled in the world, but the fact that people can turn violent against their own CSOs trying to promote reconciliation speaks abundantly about the resentment that external aid can generate. Studying the nexus EU-civil society-Palestinian-Israeli conflict cannot therefore be done without a general overview of the particular setting in which aid for conflict transformation takes place. This report is articulated in four parts. The paper first briefly discusses the nature of the conflict and recent trends in its development, affecting, inter alia, the domestic context in which civil society operates. It then looks at the EU’s involvement in the conflict and presents the tools that the EU uses in its support for civil society. Moving on, it analyses the impact and effectiveness of Israeli and Palestinian civil societies (with a view on CSO typologies and activities) and suggests why the effectiveness of civil society has remained limited. Finally the paper deals with the EU’s impact and the role of EU-funded programmes supporting civil society involvement in conflict transformation, testing the different hypotheses outlined in the guiding report issued for this work package."
"July 29, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to address some problems that derive from the economic analysis of negotiations between governments and terrorists (or terrorist organisations). The analysis demonstrates three things. First, a government’s concessions cannot unambiguously decrease the terrorist organisation’s risk aversion. Second, a government’s concession of immunity from prosecution can unambiguously decrease the terrorist organisation’s risk aversion. Third, the incentive structures imposed by the terrorist organisation can influence the risk preferences of its agents and may act to offset or reinforce the incentives or concessions offered by governments during negotiations. In addition, the paper presents a novel theoretical-analytical framework that facilitates the generation of a number of new insights into terrorist behaviour. This is a ‘contingent claims’ framework."
"July 29, 2010","This paper is the first study that analyzes the drivers of political protest using longitudinal data from a critical revolution that changed – at least temporarily – the political landscape in a transition country. We make use of a rich dataset consisting of panel data collected before and after the so called “Orange” revolution in Ukraine. Our empirical approach tackles two different – and equally interesting – features of the revolution: the determinants of participation (both in the protests and counter-protests) and the “selection” of participants into different levels of involvement (i.e. intensity of participation). We consider different drivers of participation, from traditional proxies for opportunities and grievances, but we also analyze the role of political and economic preferences, risk tolerance, life satisfaction, and indicators of network connectivity. What emerges from this study is a more nuanced pattern of participation that does not link uniquely to a single theoretical model."
"July 29, 2010","We examine the impact of leadership change after a coup d’etat on economic growth. We consider successful coup attempts as our treatment group and use failed coup attempts as controls to condition on political instability. To take account of selection bias, we control for the determinants of coup success. Our main finding is that leadership changes after a coup d’état have a positive effect on economic growth in the least developed countries, but have a negative effect in other developing countries."
"July 29, 2010","This book consists of the author's writings on China's perspective and policy with regard to its foreign relations and engagement of regional and global affairs. It covers issues ranging from the post-Cold War world order, China-US relations, the significance of China's rise, the North Korean nuclear crisis and China's policy, and China's relations with its neighbors in a new context. Rising China and World Order provides insights into China's interests and policy from an eminent Chinese scholar."
"July 29, 2010","This paper deals with the role of the EU in supporting civil society in the case of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. It analyses the patterns of development of civil society actors that played a direct or indirect role in the development of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. In the case of Georgia the paper focuses on NGOs representing the interests of internally displaced persons and civil society players involved in promoting dialogue with the Abkhaz. In the case of Abkhazia, the paper focuses on the development of Abkhaz civil society, the relative strength of which is a mini-phenomenon in itself, as well as the Abkhaz approaches to dialogue with Georgia. The paper then outlines the main EU activities vis-à-vis the civil society actors on both sides of the conflict. The paper concludes that in the absence of strong EU political engagement in conflict-resolution, EU assistance to civil society could not prevent the re-escalation of the conflict and the radicalisation of the Abkhaz and Georgian societies. However EU assistance to civil society contributed to the (parallel and separate) strengthening of civil society on both sides of the conflict lines, which can be considered an achievement in itself, however modest."
"July 29, 2010","With the formulation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2003-2004 and the signature of the EU-Moldova Action Plan in 2005, the EU became a more active player in Moldova, including on solving the Transnistrian conflict. This report sets out to analyze the EU’s engagement with local civil society organizations (CSOs) in their efforts to transform the conflict and also to assess their impact and effectiveness in doing so. In the first section, the report provides a brief outline of the conflict. Next, the report considers the domestic environment in which CSOs operate in Moldova/Transnistria, which provides a first insight into the potential for effectiveness and impact in transforming the conflict. The third section looks at the EU’s policies towards Moldova/Transnistria and in particular at its involvement in the resolution of the conflict. In the fourth section the EU’s engagement with civil society in Moldova is analyzed (in particular the EU’s ability to change the structure in which CSOs operate). In the fifth section 16 CSOs (8 from Moldova and 8 from Transnistria) are studied in terms of their activities, impact and effectiveness relating to conflict transformation. The sixth section tests the three hypotheses (the liberal peace paradigm, the leftist critique and the realist critique). The conclusion provides a synthesis of the three hypotheses and is followed by a series of policy recommendations. The paper argues that support for civil society activities appears to offer more possibilities to change the conflict’s status quo than mediation efforts, especially considering the growing consolidation of civil society in Moldova."
"July 29, 2010","The protracted Western Sahara dispute, which has for over three decades pitted Morocco against the Sahrawi independentistas of the Polisario Front, epitomises the impotence of state-led conflict resolution efforts. The European Union (EU) has voluntarily remained withdrawn from the processes of transformation of this southern neighbourhood conflict, unable to surpass the politics of its inherent inter-governmentalism. This paper examines the alternative role played by local civil society organisations (CSO) in the transformation of the Western Sahara conflict. It analyses the input of a methodologically-informed selection of Moroccan and Sahrawi CSOs with a view to identifying the potential of more effectual EU involvement in the dispute, notably through cooperation with the relevant CSOs. The findings of this study point to the overwhelmingly fuelling role played by local CSOs in this particular conflict, but identify ways in which more peace-building civil actors could be empowered by the EU. These CSOs are often of grass-root origins with little or no links to the establishments on both sides of the conflict."
"July 28, 2010","In this paper, we study the impact of transnational terrorism diffusion on security and trade. We set up a simple theoretical model predicting that the closer a country is to a source of terrorism, the higher the negative spillovers on its trade. The idea is that security measures, which impede trade, are directed both against the source country of terror and its neighbor countries where terrorism may diffuse. In contrast, we demonstrate that countries located far from terror could benefit from an increase in security by trading more. Taken to the test, we empirically document these predictions. We find (1) a direct negative impact of transnational terrorism on trade; (2) an indirect negative impact emanating from terrorism of neighbor countries; and (3) that trade is increasing with remoteness to terror. These results are robust to various definitions of the neighboring relationships among countries."
"July 28, 2010","This paper seeks to understand from a regional perspective the causes of the civil war of 1876-1877 in the Northeastern Colombian Andes. An approximation is made to the urban hierarchy in the current Colombian departments of Santander and Norte de Santander between 1853 and 1875. The conditions leading to conflict and the change in that hierarchy are presented. In addition, intervening players and the location of the events of the war are identified. It concludes that the group that fell in urban hierarchy was the one that started the war and that this hierarchical change was one of the causes of the war."
"July 28, 2010","Bangladesh earned her independence from Pakistan in 1971 after a bloody war that continued for nine months. By December 16 of 1971, the day Bangladesh declared victory, an estimated 30 million people died and 200,000 women reported sexual violence by the Pakistani Army and their Bengali accomplices. Known as one of the worst genocides in history, the systematic killing of Bengalis included a chilling attempt to exterminate the intellectuals from within Bangladeshi society. A published report claims that by April 19, 1975, 752 were convicted of war crimes. The episode after that is a bit hasty and the punishment for war criminals never took off. After the assassination of the country’s first Prime Minister and leader of the independence movement Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August, 1975 the issue of war crimes against Pakistanis and their Bengali accomplices took a back seat. Military dictatorships tortured the soul of the nation and created a financial elite class whose only motivation was to reach for the riches. As people’s revolution toppled the worst of the lot, General Ershad in 1990 democracy flourished and so did the free will of the people. With the exception of 2006, the topic of war crimes Tribunal returned in the nation’s memory and preparation began to form such platform. By 2008, the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee published a list of 1,597 criminals which included names of influential ministers, parliamentarians and political figures from two major political parties. In 2009 the Government led by the Awami League, the same political party that led Bangladesh to independence announced its plan to hold a war crimes Tribunal for the 1971 criminals under the International Was Crimes (Tribunal) Act, 1973."

"July 27, 2010","We present an explanation of the causes that have determined geopolitical changes derived from the armed confrontation between the state force and paraestatal groupings in Valle del Cauca (Colombia). This paper is the first part of a project encompassing three central components of the armed conflict and its regional impact: (a) the relevance of geography to understand political and economic transformations arising from local war; (b) the economic and financial structure supporting the formation and survival of irregular armies within a determined geographic region; (c) the strategic correlations that differentiate and assimilate the groups fighting for predominance in the regional geography. We restricted the research to the first of the three components. A later work should show us the correlations between paraestatal associations, their new identities and geopolitical impact within the whole Colombian geography."
"July 27, 2010","Given the complexities inherent in conventional counterproliferation strategies, there is some value in rethinking models of deterrence in the world after 9/11. New threats require new methods of deterrence. The traditional theory of deterrence, and its application, has atrophied since the demise of the Soviet nuclear threat. The idea that deterrence is dead has moved beyond the academy to become fairly accepted political orthodoxy. At the same time, international law scholars generally have walked away from the idea of deterrence, which is predicated on the threat of retaliation, as prohibited by Article 2, Paragraphs 3 and 4, of the U.N. Charter. These views are important because they drive not only how we look at deterrence (and what we signal to our adversaries), but also how we address other issues such as preemptive war and missile defense. One important caveat is that motivation of retaliation must be calibrated based on deterrence of future acts rather than punishment for previous acts. If deterrence does not work or cannot work, then we are more likely to find preemptive war and missile defense attractive responses to catastrophic terrorist attack."
"July 26, 2010","Years of strategic missteps in oceans policy, naval strategy and a force structure in decline set the stage for U.S. defeat at sea in 2015. After decades of double-digit budget increases, the People’s Liberation Army (Navy) was operating some of the most impressive systems in the world, including a medium-range ballistic missile that could hit a moving aircraft carrier and a super-quiet diesel electric submarine that was stealthier than U.S. nuclear submarines. Coupling this new asymmetric naval force to visionary maritime strategy and oceans policy, China ensured that all elements of national power promoted its goal of dominating the East China Sea. The United States, in contrast, had a declining naval force structured around 10 aircraft carriers spread thinly throughout the globe. With a maritime strategy focused on lower order partnerships,and a national oceans policy that devalued strategic interests in freedom of navigation, the stage was set for defeat at sea. This article recounts how China destroyed the USS George Washington in the East China Sea in 2015. The political fallout from the disaster ended 75 years of U.S. dominance in the Pacific Ocean and cemented China’s position as the Asian hegemon."
"July 26, 2010","This interpretive essay provides a socio-cultural explanation of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute based on the rich narrative account of the conflict by Benedek (1999). A macro-level of analysis is taken so as to identify the general trends of the conflict. SPITCEROW, the acronym for a simple analytical instrument, is used to identify the main components of the overall conflict. Finally an analytical section explains the conflict through the use of the Social Identity Theory and supports it by using a broad cultural approach. The paper concludes that identity needs were at the core of the conflict and that once those issues were addressed and satisfactorily resolved, secondary issues were amicably negotiated and a settlement was reached."

Mattel, Inc., the Court found that parties to an arbitration agreement could not supplement, by contract, the statutory grounds for challenging an arbitration award. Unfortunately, the Court called into doubt a long line of cases holding that a party could seek to vacate an arbitration decision where the arbitrator exhibited a manifest disregard for the law."

"July 25, 2010","In the realm of adults, name-calling is often a fact of life that one simply brushes off like water rolls off a duck’s back. At some point, however, racial slurs and ethnic epithets hurled at employees constitute actionable discrimination rooted in palpable and entrenched stereotypes. In the case of Muslims, Arabs, and South Asians, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks not only caused an upsurge in hatred, violence, and discrimination, but also entrenched preexisting negative stereotypes. Targeted law enforcement efforts and media images stereotyping dark-skinned, bearded males with Arabic-sounding names as representing the primary threat to the national  security of the United States contribute to racial, national origin, and religious harassment in the workplace."
"July 25, 2010","Several incidents involving U.S. contractors, most famously Blackwater Worldwide, have highlighted the difficulty in providing consistent overseas criminal jurisdiction for U.S. citizens serving overseas.  Congress has attempted fill a jurisdictional void with the passage of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) and an amendment to the Uniform Code of Military Justice which could be interpreted to subject contractors to trial by military courts-martial.  However, both these efforts have serious shortcomings in that MEJA narrowly defines who qualifies as a “contractor”, and the assertion of criminal jurisdiction over U.S. civilians raises constitutional questions."
"July 25, 2010","On December 4, 2001, federal agents raided the offices of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, arrested the organization’s officers, and froze $5 million worth of assets. Ten days later on December 14, 2001, the Global Relief Fund suffered the same fate when its assets were seized, and its co-founder Rabih Haddad was arrested. That same day Benevolence International’s assets were also frozen, and its U.S. citizen president, Enaam Arnaout, was arrested and taken into custody on charges of providing material support to terrorism. Prior to their effective closure, the three organizations were the largest Islamic charities in the United States. Although each charitable organization had been operating for more than a decade, all three were systematically raided and shut down soon after the federal government’s post-9/11 official declaration of its war on terrorism - a war that includes prosecuting anyone who provides material support to designated terrorist organizations. By February 2003, the Department of Justice proudly announced its completion of 70 similar investigations into terrorism financing, designating 36 entities as terrorist organizations, and freezing over $113 million in financial assets of 62 organizations allegedly supporting terrorism. The fact that almost every criminal terrorism case filed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks has included a charge of providing material support to a terrorist organization reveals the significance of material support laws as the linchpin of the ongoing war on terrorism."
"July 25, 2010","The rules governing states’ conduct in times of war have always been the topic of heated discussion during, or in the wake of, major international conflicts. Such was the case, for example, following the increasingly “modern” and destructive wars of the late nineteenth century (which were followed by the adoption of the Hague Conventions) and after World War II (which led to the Geneva Conventions). In the midst of the current “war on terror” - which is characterized by the emergence of non-state entities as key protagonists - calls are heard, yet again, to reconsider the rules governing warfare."

"July 24, 2010","The scholarship that partition of India has generated is as varied and contested as the outcome of the event itself. Partition which was viewed as a mode of easy exit by the colonial powers from the Indian subcontinent became synonymous with the violence that broke out with the partition itself. Among the violence victims, women have been most vulnerable. In spite of an avalanche of modern Indian history researches centering around partition of India and decolonization, the tales of women experiences have been recent entries in these narratives. Women who have been the worst victims of the process, suffering in silence, found their voices silenced in most decolonization narratives, which were written by man and for ‘mankind’. While each of these partition narratives were efforts to informally memorialize the event, women’s sufferings found no space in such memorials, till recent times. But, apart from most of these studies being socially non-inclusive, they suffered from geographical myopia as well. Their obsessions with Punjab initially, and then a grudging accommodation of Bengal in the partition has failed to include Assam, which in spite of being the ‘other’ site of ‘partition of India’ remained absent from their scholarly ‘gaze’. If Assam represented the marginal in partition discourse, its women represented the marginal within the marginal, or twice marginalized. This study is an attempt to highlight the voices of these ‘twice marginalized’ in the Indian partition discourse."
"July 24, 2010","The paper demolishes the lingering viewpoint that partition of Indian subcontinent was caused by religious animosity between the Muslims and the Hindus, and substantiates that unequal exchange of material and mental amenities among the people belonging to sensitive social groups leads to the formation and fragmentation of nation-states along the march of the process-structure - process syndrome in extant society."
"July 24, 2010","The right to judicial review of the legality of a person’s detention, commonly known as the right to habeas corpus, serves as a critical safeguard of personal liberty.   This right, which has long been considered fundamental in diverse legal systems around the world, received renewed attention in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  The detention of suspected terrorists around the globe in response to the attacks has sparked a vigorous debate about the extent to which habeas corpus should be available in cases where the government invokes national security concerns."
"July 24, 2010","This paper looks at partition theory as regards South Asia and claims that the Bengal partition differed significantly from the Punjab model. It argues that the Punjab partition cannot be seen as a universal model. Moreover, the paper does not regard the partition of 1947 as the sole partition in Bengal, but looks at Bengal’s partition history as part of a process starting in 1905 and culminating in 1971 when East Pakistan became Bangladesh. Finally, the paper emphasizes regionalism as an important component of the Bengal partitions. The paper pays attention to the physical map of partition: the delta, its rivers, ports and cities and their respective hinterlands all have their ‘own’ histories which were reoriented after the partition of 1947. Moreover, a new geographical and political category, the enclaves that emerged post-1947, is also studied. Today, soon after the signing of the New Delhi-Dhaka bilateral agreement, this revisiting of Bengal’s partition history, and the physical map of the two Bengals, is especially significant."
"July 24, 2010","What do appeals of administrative decisions tell us about the processes that give rise to them? Bid protests of Department of Defense source selections are illustrative. Rejected bidders can appeal to the Government Accountability Office. GAO sustains protests – few, but costly and growing – on grounds of procedural irregularity. Applying concepts from organizational economics, conflict management, and dispute systems design, we explore misalignments among management practices within agencies that can contribute to procedural errors and, thereby, to appeals. A conflict management audit, including interviews with participants in the process and analysis of GAO’s bid protest decisions, identifies sources of conflict in misalignments among strategy, structure, human resources, policies and procedures, and monitoring. Strategically adjusting the decisions to contract out, expanding authority and responsibility for risk management, creating professional development opportunities, revisiting policies on bundling and duration of contracts, and using performance information to incentivize the workforce can mitigate bid protests."
"July 24, 2010","This contribution offers a comprehensive empirical analysis of the effects of education on terrorism for 118 countries for the period 1984 to 2007. We find that education and terrorism are not directly linked, so that education neither fosters nor retards terrorism on its own. Rather, our results suggest that education may fuel terrorist activity in the presence of poor political and socio-economic conditions, whereas better education in combination with favorable conditions decreases terrorism. Thus, the precise effect of education on terrorism depends on country-specific conditions. A successful anti-terrorism strategy should therefore focus on a country's political and socio-economic development, in addition to educational attainment."

"July 23, 2010","Throughout the so-called Third Wave of democratization, transitional justice became a prominent issue as democratizing polities frequently wrestled with addressing human rights violations perpetrated under the prior regime. Up until recently, the Middle East has been impervious from this trend. However, questions of transitional justice have recently become salient issues across the region. Morocco, Iraq, and Afghanistan are among those that are in the process of constructing or conducting some form of transitional justice experiment or have recently completed their effort. This paper takes stock of the Middle Eastern transitional justice experience. After providing an overview of what has gone on, I make provisional conclusions as to what outcomes we might expect and, for those that have run their course, identify what effects these experiments have had on their respective societies. I also prognosticate as to the viability of further exporting transitional justice models across the region should future opportunities arise."
"July 23, 2010","Little has been written about partition and its aftermath with respect to the neighboring Punjabi cities of Lahore and Amritsar. Both were profoundly affected by the legacies of violence, mass migration and their emergence as new border towns. Lahore was eventually able to recover from the economic setbacks, but Amritsar faced long-standing problems. This paper seeks to bring a comparative approach to the understanding of the impact of partition on the two localities. It focuses on four major themes: first, the characteristics of the partition-related violence in the cities; secondly, the differential class and community experiences of violence, migration and resettlement; thirdly, the ways in which memory and national historical discourses impact upon each other with respect to the cities remembered past; finally, the extent to which Lahore and Amritsar became refugee-dominated cities and the degree to which migrants and locals competed and cooperated with each other in the aftermath of partition."
"July 23, 2010","This chapter considers how concepts designed to regulate state-to-state interaction apply to conflicts involving nonstate actors - be they guerilla groups, terrorist organizations, or private military contractors. The “principle of distinction” holds that civilians and combatants are clearly distinguishable protagonists on or near the battlefield. “Reciprocity” in international law refers to the expectation by a belligerent state that other state parties to a conflict will respect similar legal and behavioral norms - non-use of prohibited weaponry, minimization of collateral damage, and humane treatment of prisoners of war. I focus on reciprocity and distinction because they constitute meta-issues whose resolution determines the applicability of accepted legal principles to virtually all modern conflicts. A close examination of these topics suggests that reciprocity and the principle of distinction are of central importance in conflicts involving nonstate actors.  On the issue of distinction, I argue for a more expansive understanding of the notion of combatant - an understanding that allows for the greater application of international humanitarian law to nonstate actors, an easier implementation of the principle of distinction, and improved protection of civilian populations. On the issue of reciprocity, I argue that most of international humanitarian law is binding in most conflicts on most actors (whether or not the parties behave reciprocally). The only situation in which a state may not be bound by all of humanitarian law is when an opposing nonstate party repeatedly violates international humanitarian law in an international armed conflict."
"July 23, 2010","As the United States works toward a drawdown of combat forces in Iraq by this August, and a withdrawal of all troops by 2011, military commanders and diplomats are scrambling to make sure that the Iraqi government will be ready to take over. Recent discussions have focused on the real, short-term challenges of finalizing national elections and forming a new government. But these talks have often deferred or overlooked the one underlying issue that has become the elephant in the room: Kurdistan."
"July 23, 2010","The partition of India in 1947 resulted in displacement of approximately 18 million people in Punjab and Bengal and killing of thousands. For Bengal, the refugee exodus continued for years after partition. It is important to note that while the Partition of Punjab was a one-time event with carnage and forced migration, however restricted primarily to first few years, the Partition of Bengal has turned out to be a continuing process. It would be important to observe that how these people struggled to reconstruct their lives, and to what extent their new environment posed a challenge to their existence and culture. What was their attitude towards the government policies of relief and rehabilitation? The government policy to resettle these migrants requires a critical appraisal. For a proper analysis and critique of the government policy, we need to depend upon the government sources, especially of the Ministry of Refugee, Relief and Rehabilitation of Government of West Bengal and those of the Department of Rehabilitation, Government of India, and the Lok Sabha Debates and West Bengal State Legislative Assembly Debates, Report of the Indian Planning Commission etc., along with other sources."
"July 23, 2010","This chapter considers what Brazil might gain from creating a truth commission to examine human rights abuses that occurred more than twenty years ago. Considering the myriad goals attributed to truth commissions, the 2004 UN report suggests that they have the potential to uncover information, promote human rights, strengthen democracy, encourage victim healing, and promote reconciliation. Below, I consider the prognosis for a truth commission contributing to each of these ends in Brazil and the policy choices that may be necessary in order to achieve these ends. Brazilians should not expect too much from a truth commission and there may be unpleasant compromises necessary to achieve some of these goals. Nonetheless, on balance, a truth commission would be a positive step."
"July 22, 2010","The firing of a commanding general in time of war differs significantly from other major presidential decisions.  These episodes illuminate and alter the President’s relationship with the military that he commands.  They affect the conduct of the war and quite possibly its outcome.  And they have long-term implications for the armed services.  This paper examines three of the most notable cases in order to draw some conclusions about this high-stakes gambit.  In particular, it will study Abraham Lincoln’s 1862 removal of George B. McClellan, Harry Truman’s 1951 relief of Douglas MacArthur, and Barack Obama’s recent decision to accept the resignation of Stanley A. McChrystal.  It will offer insights and recommendations for future leaders facing the kind of situation that might lead a president to relieve a general of his command."
"July 22, 2010","This paper examines the interplay between warfare and taxation in nineteenth-century Italy, from the end of the Napoleonic era in 1815 to unification in 1861. The institutional variety at the regional level makes the Italian peninsula a unique testing ground for comparative study. Using a new database, we argue that pre-unitary states pursued different fiscal policies in response to diverse domestic and external political environments. Our long-run empirical analysis complements recent theoretical works about state capacity. By emphasizing public finances, we also uncover novel insights into the process of state formation in Italy."
"July 21, 2010","Foreign direct investment can play an important role in promoting economic growth in post-conflict states. In order to attract the benefits of foreign investment, a host country must ensure foreign investors that they can safely invest there. In post-conflict economies, the physical safety concerns, combined with a general distrust of post-conflict governments, are among the key considerations for foreign investors.  However, foreign investors also recognize that new and untapped opportunities become available in a post-conflict context. This article first seeks to identify certain issues relating to foreign investment that, from the perspective of the international lawyer, both post-conflict governments and potential investors in those countries should consider.   The second part of this article illustrates some of these issues in practice by considering the specific case study of Iraq."
"July 21, 2010","Is the type, duration, and intensity of political repression a prelude to civil war? This study assesses the role political repression plays in civil war initiation and duration? Specifically, do repressive governments risk civil war with extended repression? Furthermore, is the type, duration, or intensity of repression the most important factor in creating the conditions for civil war? Civil war is characterized by violence on the part of two parties, while political repression is the use of violence by the government. The greed hypothesis of civil war sees acquisition of resources as the motivating factor in conflict, while the grievance hypothesis emphasizes grievances as the basis for conflict initiation. Tests of these hypotheses have proven difficult and given mixed results. We attempt to bridge the divide between the more political based grievance hypothesis and the economic based greed hypothesis by assessing political repression and its effects on civil war initiation and duration within a large-N statistical model. Our attempt is similar to the insurgency model suggested by Davenport et al. (2008). We apply Granger causality testing to determine the theoretical causal direction of the relationship of repression and civil war in our models. This allows increased precision in assessing the impact of repression in our models and hypothesis testing. This paper engages the literature with a unique examination of the conflict processes involved in civil war and provides rigorous testing."

"July 19, 2010","What effect, if any, does democracy have on outcomes of counterinsurgencies? Contrary to theoretical predictions, empirical studies have found little evidence that regime type affects government’s performance in such conflicts. I argue that to evaluate the role of regime type in determining the outcomes of such conflicts we have to examine which governments face insurgencies and why. Using a new dataset that includes also insurgencies that fall short of the civil war threshold I find that certain aspects of regime type affect which governments are selected into such conflicts. Furthermore, this selection explains why we do not observe the effect of regime type on counterinsurgency performance of those governments that end up fighting insurgents. Additionally, I show that public goods provision reduces the likelihood of insurgencies, whereas institutional constraints do not make democracies less successful counterinsurgents."
"July 19, 2010","This paper assesses the claim that present day individuals can be said to have inherited either rights or duties of compensation as a result of historic injustice. It does this by developing a theoretical understanding of relations between past and present, which is located within a particular approach to international distributive justice, which I term “international libertarianism”. This understanding is applied to a specific case study: the systematic policy of sexual slavery perpetrated by the Japanese army during World War II, often referred to as the “comfort women” system. I argue both that the Japanese people as a whole possess compensatory duties to victims of this system in the present day, and that the class of “victims” can be meaningfully expanded to include not only the women themselves, but also their descendants, who can plausibly be said to have inherited rights to compensation from their mothers."
"July 19, 2010","The paper starts from the assumption that OC is a specific type of system oriented towards an authoritative allocation of resources and that, as such, cannot survive without a territory where its power can be exerted through a mechanism of extortion and protection. The introduction states firstly that the cradle of OC is in the city, where it embodies the most unconventional and violent face of the capitalist accumulation of resources. Secondly, it asserts that it is necessary to take a closer look at the relationship between the city and the state in the nation-building process. The OC is, in fact, a direct consequence of the attempt, on the part of the central government, to reduce the cost of the process of the monopolization of force by co-opting local potentates instead of defeating them. The paper then compares Palermo and Ciudad Juárez, by looking at the two different paradigmatic models of OC that originated in these two cities: the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and the maras. Besides, Italy and Mexico share many political and social variables in their historical evolution: the late formation of a unified state in the second half of the 1850s; the strategic even if peripheral role in the international politics, thanks to their peculiar relationships with the US; but also the Spanish legacy (in Italy, mainly in Southern regions), which probably helps us to explain other cultural similarities (e.g. family and religion). The first section shortly reconstructs the history of Cosa nostra, emphasizing how its process of institutionalization and entrenchment in the Palermitan society results in one of the most striking example of political Mafia. The second section analyzes the role of OC after the end of Cold War, when old hierarchies of scale, based on nation-states, became destabilized, and when the historic dependence on the center of so many peripheries in the international system was replaced by the center’s growing subjugation to the peripheries. The third section analyzes Ciudad Juárez both comparing it with other Latin American cities that gave birth to some of the most famous cartels of narco-trafficking, and stressing its peculiarities that concur to define the assembled crime paradigm. The conclusion, finally, challenges the widely accepted assumption that state violence – i.e. war on drugs – can be the right strategy to combat OC. On the contrary, social scientists should revisit and develop Tilly’s idea of trust networks to find at least a theoretically plausible answer to OC."
"July 19, 2010","A number of studies have claimed variously that democracies are effective in mobilizing to defend perceived national interests or to seek redress against perceived injustices committed by non-democracies. This paper examines the question of whether the need of regimes to respond to the preferences of democratic publics makes democracies more likely than other states to engage in hostilities."
"July 19, 2010","Recent research demonstrates that leader change during war significantly increases the probability of war termination. However, leader changes caused by assassinations or by elec- tions are likely to have very different effects on the possibility of bringing war to an end. This paper explores the effect of regular and irregular leader transitions on the likelihood of war ter- mination. To get around the simultaneity problem between war termination and leader change, the paper estimates a competing risks bivariate survival model. The evidence shows that leader change –regardless of its type– in large coalition systems never increases the probability of war termination, while leader change –regardless of its type– in small coalition systems never reduces the probability of war termination. In short, leader transitions in autocratic systems are more likely to bring interstate war to an end than leader transitions in democratic ones. The study also shows that, as war progresses, the effect of leader change fades away."

"July 19, 2010","The choice to pursue international arbitration and adjudication is part of a political bargaining process. Since bargaining over contentious issues in international relations occurs in the shadow of potential military conflict, the outcomes of negotiations often reflect the balance of power between states. In a game theoretic model, we show that states will only jointly agree to arbitration or adjudication when the expected outcome of such a process does not diverge significantly from a division based upon the balance of power between the disputing states. Our analysis implies that the possibility of war in the anarchic international system constrains the ability of states to use legal means to resolve their disputes."
"July 19, 2010","There is widespread agreement among scholars and practitioners that the counterterrorism literature suffers from a lack of primary-source field research. The absence of solid ethnographic research has yielded studies that suffer from a lack of rigorous analysis and often result in opinion masquerading as analysis. The lack of field research is also due to a failure to integrate ethnographic research into modeling efforts, as well as a failure more broadly to appreciate the significance of ethnographically valid data in human, social, cultural, and behavioral studies in a systematic investigation of terrorist behavior. The project briefly outlined in this paper seeks to redress this deficiency by combining the strengths of ethnographic field research (collected by social scientists at Penn State) with the sophisticated modeling capabilities of computer scientists (at Carnegie Mellon University). Specifically, we are analyzing data from interview transcripts, news reports, and other open sources concerning the militant activist group Al-Muhajiroun and the terrorist groups Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Using competitive adaptation as a comparative organizational framework, this project focuses on the process by which adversaries learn from each other in complex adaptive systems and tailor their activities to achieve their organizational goals in light of their opponents‟ actions. Ultimately, we will develop a meso-level model of militant networks that combines insights from political science, organizational theory, psychology, network science, and computational modeling."
"July 19, 2010","The people of Afghanistan have endured over thirty years of continuous war. Starting in 1979 with the Soviet invasion, the war ravaged nation has been subjected to the challenges of internal strife and external intrusion that spans the spectrum of conflict. As U.S. and NATO (ISAF) forces seek a clear end to involvement in counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan, the current state is at best only slightly more stable than when the Soviets departed in 1989. Assessing Afghanistan with more candor the current situation is stark - after nine years of hard campaigning in Afghanistan, the situation is as dire and uncertain as ever."
"July 19, 2010","Can weak actors defeat strong ones in nonviolent settings, and if so, how? If power generally leads to preferred outcomes in international relations, and if power asymmetry has been the defining characteristic of US relations with Latin America, what explains the recurrent US difficulty in shaping inter-American relations against Latin American wishes? This paper builds on recent work on asymmetric conflict, derives new hypotheses about nonviolent asymmetric interactions, and tests these through rigorous process-tracing with primary documents in a least-likely case: the origins of the Alliance for Progress. My central argument is that weak states have the motivation and ability to shape the regional policy agenda during noncrisis periods; thus, because great powers in crisis situations select options from this agenda, our historical knowledge of relations between regional powers and their weaker neighbors dramatically overstates the influence of hegemony and understates the autonomous agency of weaker states."

"July 19, 2010","The implementation of post-conflict transitional justice in Northern Ireland has been an extremely contentious part of the tenuous peace. Indeed, issues of accountability and culpability frequently trouble countries in times of transition and post-conflict reconstruction.  Following more than thirty years of civil war, Northern Ireland now struggles with how to remember, reconcile and recover from the violence. Yet parties to the conflict fail to agree on the simple dichotomy of who are the victims and who were the perpetrators. Through an analysis of 40 in-depth interviews conducted with ordinary people who suffered violence, this paper examines the variations in violence experienced during the Troubles and how this variation is affecting justice claims in the post-conflict period. The future of peace in Northern Ireland has yet to be determined, but it is certain that issues of justice and accountability will be central in the healing and political reconstruction of the country."
"July 19, 2010","In this paper, I argue that the phenomenon of footloose nuclear scientific workers is much less dangerous than has generally been assumed, because the mere availability of foreign scientific talent does not give states a simple shortcut to bypass the difficulties of successfully managing nuclear weapons projects.  In fact, identifying, successfully recruiting, and then inducing hard work out of top-flight foreign scientific workers requires even more managerial finesse than is needed when dealing with domestic ones.  Therefore, while I acknowledge that highly institutionalized states with well-organized nuclear programs can benefit from the contributions of émigré nuclear scientific workers, I stress that low-institutionalized states with poorly organized nuclear programs — which is probably the modal case among developing countries — cannot benefit nearly as much from such foreign help, and indeed their progress may even be substantially retarded by it."
"July 19, 2010","This paper is a first cut at the analysis of a new (and as of this writing) incomplete database on bombing and territorial control in the Vietnam War. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the logic of attrition in insurgencies at the village level. More specifically, I address two questions. First, how did the very extensive US aerial bombing of South Vietnam affect the population growth (or depopulation) of villages? Second, what consequences did bombing and population change have on the ability of the Viet Cong to control villages? Did attrition via bombing tend to flip villages to South Vietnamese government control or did it undermine counterinsurgency efforts?"
"July 19, 2010","A recent study has shown that the democratic peace—the observation that democratic nations rarely, if ever, fight each other—may be spurious: a capitalist contract-intensive economy appears to account for both democracy and the democratic peace (Mousseau 2009). Since then several defenses of the democratic peace have emerged, including the point that if an unusually high standard of democracy (Polity2 = 10) is employed on analyses of fatal militarized interstate disputes, then it is not possible to differentiate which factor causes the peace, capitalism or democracy. This study re-examines the capitalism and democracy issue by reviewing all theories of capitalist peace, addressing all the defenses of the democratic peace, and reporting new analyses of all (fatal and non-fatal) militarized interstate disputes. The results are clear and clean: on a sample of most nations from 1961 to 2001 even the highest measure of democracy is insignificant once one single variable, contract-intensive economy, is considered, and contract-intensive economy is shown to be a powerful force for peace. While other capitalist peace variables do not overturn the democratic peace, they are shown to be robust, indicating that capitalism is a multidimensional force for peace. It is suggested that the capitalist peace may be considered a modification or emendation of the democratic peace research program rather than a direct challenge to it."
"July 19, 2010","The concept of cause is closely linked to that of power, and power is related to our sense of who or what is responsible for outcomes.  In a complex world, such attributions are difficult.  As Stephen Krasner has shown, the apparent agents of power and responsibility may not be the crucial ones.  This topic is explored first through examining sufficient causation and the problems created by multiple sufficient causation.  This is followed by a discussion of the parallel problems that appear when we look at necessary conditions.  I then turn to complexities created by chronology, which include the fact that the choices actors confront may be structured by the actions and power of others, and the need to choose a starting point in the interaction, which can be both arbitrary and crucial."
"July 19, 2010","Gendered norms about women’s behavior include that of nurturers, caregivers and peacemakers. In fact, in times of intra- and interstate conflict, women often make a conscious choice to work for peace as a form of political activism. Sometimes these actions are driven by feminist goals, defined as promoting political, social and economic equality of women and men, and sometimes they are the result of more basic and traditional ideas, specifically, as a wife and/or mother who want peace in her society.  Often the goal of women’s activism is not only to bring about peace, but to change the circumstances that contributed to the violence in the first place, or, as Johann Galtung refers to this, structural violence. As we and others have noted, changing the social structure to eliminate the attributes that contributed to the onset of violence is more characteristic of women’s approaches to peacemaking and conflict resolution than of men’s."
"July 19, 2010","In this paper we develop a multilateral (k-adic) empirical framework for analyzing the flow of terrorist activity across state borders.  Building on Poast’s (2010) k-adic framework for analyzing multilateral alliance behavior, we have created a directional k-adic design that allows us to track the flow of terrorist violence from multiple potential base states toward another target state.  Our analysis of transnational terrorist activity from 2000-2007 demonstrates that flow of transnational terrorist activity is a function of the opportunity and willingness to use terrorist tactics.  Specifically, we find that the opportunity to launch terrorist attacks is primarily a function of distance and accessibility and relative power.  On the other hand, we find that he willingness of non-state groups to use violence against civilians in other states is primarily a function of conflicting interests between the host and target states, and differences in ethnic and religious identity."
"July 19, 2010","This paper analyzes the uses of force in two successful counterinsurgency (COIN) campaigns to delineate under what conditions the use of military force serves the state’s strategic ends, and under what conditions it hinders them. The conventional wisdom prescribes the strictly limited use of force in COIN. Historically, however, successful states have used considerable force, including massive force and including the targeting of civilians. I argue that successful counterinsurgency requires using force selectively: to punish and deter, for denial, and to show resolve. Further, I sketch the conditions under which each type of force is likely to achieve state political ends, and under what conditions it is not. The cases are the British-led campaign in Dhofar, Oman, 1965-1976, and the U.S.-backed campaign in El Salvador, 1979-1992."
"July 19, 2010","This paper argues that Russia’s international behavior can be conceptualized by understanding how events in the late 20th and early 21st centuries shaped the country’s views on sovereignty. The central research question is the following: how have perceptions of sovereignty shaped Russian foreign policy in the post-communist period? And how does Moscow reconcile its vigorous opposition to Kosovo’s independence with support for the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, when the two situations are roughly comparable? This study analyzes how competing views of sovereignty have shaped Russian foreign policy by drawing on two events in post-communist era: NATO’s defense of Kosovo and the bombing of Yugoslavia, with the subsequent recognition of the latter as an independent state; and the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, with Moscow’s subsequent recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Each case highlights fundamental security issues for both Russia and Europe, and each presents a rich body of material for assessing varying conceptions of sovereignty and how these affect international relations."
"July 19, 2010","The prospects of politically violent non-state actors utilizing chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons has captured the imaginations of not only public officials and the news media, but also a sizeable group of scholars who have sought to better define and characterize this apparent threat. Yet little of this work is quantitative in nature and global in scope. This study presents an analysis of the decision to pursue CBRN weapons that leverages data from the Monterey Weapons of Mass Destruction dataset and the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT). Our findings suggest that organizations embedded in alliance structures and based in authoritarian countries with relatively strong connections to a globalized world are more likely to seek to develop or acquire CBRN weapons. Contrary to previous studies, we failed to find a significant relationship between CBRN pursuit and either religious ideology or two measures of organizational capabilities."
"July 19, 2010","In this paper I advance an explanation of the social origins of cocaine trafficking in Colombia in which two thresholds are distinguish. The first threshold occurs when the knowledge and the willingness for a specific criminal activity reproduce faster than the enforcement capacity of the authorities, and the second one, at a more advanced stage of diffusion of crime in society, when the state is forced to consider the political demands of criminal organizations. This explanation aims to explore an aspect of crime that is usually neglected by the specialized literature: the role of crime in the political structure and eventually in the process of state making. My argument here is that in order to acquire political power crime has to experience a process of diffusion into the social order to the extent of redefining the relationships, the values, and the hierarchies of a large part of the society."
"July 19, 2010","I analyze a bargaining model where two states,  one of which consists of a government and an opposition, may either negotiate or fight a war whose length is determined endogenously. Four key results emerge. First, the foreign state is often unable to learn the democratic state lacks resolve by observing the opposition's prewar position. Second, short wars can be caused by the opposition initially supporting the use of force, then after a period of fighting, opposing continuing the war. Third, the opposition sometimes causes long wars that end poorly by supporting the war initially then quickly turning against it even when the war would not have occurred at all had they advocated peace initially. Finally, the opposition sometimes causes long wars that end poorly by unwaveringly advocating their continuation when the government would have been willing to quit earlier had the opposition called on them to do so."
"July 19, 2010","In 2001, the United States demanded that the Taliban government of Afghanistan extradite Osama bin Laden to face trial for the 9-11 attacks. After first refusing the demand, the Taliban offered to try him according to sharia law in Afghanistan, should the US provide them with evidence of his crime. The US rejected this counter-offer, and began the military campaign threatened in their ultimatum. The Taliban behavior in this case is curious. Even if they believed that they could eventually beat the Americans, it was clear that it would be a long, difficult, and costly fight. Stranger still was their counter offer: if their rejection was really rooted in ideology, why not reject the demand outright? The Taliban’s concern for their honor seems to have driven their behavior. Most observers agree that Afghan, and particularly Pastun, culture is thoroughly concerned with honor. Years before, then bin Laden had entered Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, he had been welcomed as a guest. According to the dictates of the pashtunwali honor culture, guests must be protected from outsiders. This relationship was further deepened when bin Laden gave Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban, his bayat, his oath of allegiance. In these circumstances, for the Taliban to hand bin Laden over to the Americans would have been gravely dishonorable. To try him themselves, for violations of their own law, was the most that they could have done without dishonoring themselves. For these men, a long and difficult war, though perhaps tragic, was better than dishonor."
"July 19, 2010","As candidate for President, Barack Obama pledged to renew American leadership in the world in the wake of the ‘tragically misguided’ thinking of the Bush administration.1 Yet the strategic issues that animated the candidate were subsumed by the financial crisis that was ultimately crucial in handing victory to Obama, so that upon assuming office the world that his predecessor had bequeathed to him was one of a far more profound crisis of American ideology and power than simply the fallout from the Bush administration’s war on terror. Still, the National Security Strategy issued by the administration in May 2010 was explicitly “focused on renewing American leadership”."
"July 19, 2010","Jean Guilleman (MIT 2007) establishes the Bush Administration’s logic of national security for biological weapons as dichotomous between their choice of a self-governed code of “right” behavior and “effective” legal restraints.  A compromise system resulted after the cold war that delivered responsibility for the operation of the system to state-based and international scientific academies and organizations.  Scientific procedures to create transparency in research for the purpose of preventing applications to bioweaponry and bioterror is a rational activity and should have high utility as implemented by rational actors within rational scientific organizations.  However, a major concern is the empirical record of scientists acting in past events as if in a moral vacuum – where research and engineering were achieved for human destruction and state weapons and terror.  Guilleman argues that rational methods of codes of behavior must be combined with transparency in open research communities that do not morph into closed enclaves over time.  We seek to add to this logic by investigating a further dimension within this particular scientific community.  What is the level of ethical knowledge and moral training for the bioscientist in a specific community that is now pursuing an open policy of transparent biosecurity?  The International Gene Synthesis Consortium announced in November 2009 is now engaged in the implementation of a gene sequencing screening protocol toward the prevention of doing work that would aid and abet biological weapons developers and/or terrorists.  Using survey instruments and in-depth interviews – we seek to utilize the openness of these companies to elucidate the level of ethical knowledge within their scientific ranks and to provide an analysis as to whether or not this adds value to the code of behavior model of biosecurity that Guilleman puts forth as best effort at the end of the Bush Administration."
"July 19, 2010","The observation that life experiences shape an individual’s future behavior constitutes a central assumption in fields such as psychology and sociology. While many political scientists may intuitively grasp this insight, for the most part it has escaped careful and systematic analysis. However, three short anecdotes demonstrate the potential power of life experience in explaining the behavior and policy choices of political leaders. First, while many factors shaped the 2008 campaign for President in the United States, one prominent factor was the comparison between Barack Obama’s background as a community organizer versus John McCain’s background as a decorated fighter pilot. Pundits and voters wondered whether Obama’s lack of military experience should count against him, just as they had with regards to Bill Clinton in 1992. The question of military service and candidate backgrounds in general nearly always plays a role in US presidential campaigns. In the 2004 election, John Kerry’s military service became a source of strength to his supporters and a target for fierce criticism by his detractors. Kerry and his handlers suggested that his combat experience in Vietnam provided him with insight that would prove helpful in the War on Terrorism if the public were to elect him.3 Across the Atlantic in 2003, some commentators discussing the French position opposing the American led invasion of Iraq linked the life experiences and political behavior of the French president Jacques Chirac, arguing that Chirac’s military service in Algeria in the 1950s powerfully influenced the way he calculated the costs and benefits of armed conflict.4 Finally, when Hu Jintao rose to power in China in 2002, some argued that his status as the first leader of China since 1949 lacking revolutionary experience and military education would profoundly affect the People’s Republic of China’s foreign policy."
"July 19, 2010","This paper considers the efficacy of sanctions and inducements in achieving proliferation objectives vis-à-vis North Korea, with a particular emphasis on US strategy. Two structural constraints operate on both instruments of economic statecraft: North Korea’s particularly repressive state, with a narrowing governing coalition; and the country’s changing economic relations. As an empirical matter, there is little evidence that sanctions had effect, or did so only in conjunction with inducements. However, inducements did not yield significant progress either, in part because of profound credibility problems in the negotiations."
"July 19, 2010","During the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in both funds spent and troops sent on peacekeeping operations (PKOs). At present, however, little analysis on the efficacy of PKOs have been carried out. To ameliorate this, this paper specifies a statistical model to estimate the efficacy of UN PKOs in preventing the onset, escalation, continuation, and recurrence of internal armed conflict. The model is a dynamic multinomial logit model on a 1970 {2008 cross-sectional dataset of changes between no armed conflict, minor conflict, and major conflict. We employ a new dataset detailing interalia the budgets and mandates of PKOs to study how the efficacy of PKOs depends on these factors. Core exogenous explanatory variables in the estimation model are population size, infant mortality rates, demographic composition, neighborhood characteristics, and education levels. We combine the results from the statistical model with a simulation/prediction procedure to explore a set of questions related to PKOs: What is the long-term effect of PKOs? In what type of countries should PKO efforts be concentrated? Is it possible to identify an optimal budget for a PKO? Predictions of how PKOs affect future conflict levels are obtained through simulating the behavior of the conflict variable as implied by the estimates from the statistical model, using projections of demographic and education-related variables from the UN and the IIASA. We use out-of-sample validation of prediction performance to identify the best statistical model and to evaluate its predictive performance."
"July 19, 2010","Reporting results from a nationwide public opinion survey and an survey-based experiment, this paper explores how and whether accounts of contemporary threats - whether presented as fact (news) or fiction - influence judgments about how to respond to the real world security environment. The survey reveals a variety of striking correlations between the consumption of non-factual, entertainment media (television and film) and beliefs about US national security policy and the country’s technological and operational capabilities. In the experiment, subjects (N=190) read either no story or excerpts from one of two narratives - one presented as factual and one fictional - about the smuggling potential terrorists across the US-Mexican border and establishment of sleeper cells in the US. Results showed that both factual and fictional accounts influenced subjects’ assessments of the threats posed by terrorism and illegal immigration in the United States and about the urgency with which policymakers should address these issues. How and why explicitly fictional narratives may influence real world attitudes and perception of threats is also discussed."
"July 19, 2010","This paper argues that the relationship between Muslim immigrants and left political parties in Western Europe is more complex than current research suggests.  While left parties endorse economic and social policies that appeal generally to immigrants, they frequently take positions that conflict with the specific interests of Muslims.  It is difficult to predict when and where the left will oppose policies that concern Islam because politicians from the same party may oppose a policy in one location and not in another, or reject policies that other party members endorsed.  To validate these claims, this paper presents original data on the policymaking activities of left parties within two Berlin municipalities."
"July 19, 2010","Any “Russia watcher” will be aware that the year 2008 was full of significance for Russian domestic and foreign policy. This was the year of two key events with worldwide press resonance: the formal transfer of presidential power from Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin to his chosen successor Dmitrii Anatolievich Medvedev, and the unprecedented armed conflict in Georgia, where Russian tanks crossed the borders of a former Soviet Republic for the first time since the collapse of the USSR. At the same time, it is the contention of this paper that 2008 was also the year in which a third important event occurred, with the potential to tangibly influence Russian domestic politics; în December 5, 2008 Aleksii II, who had been the Orthodox patriarch of Moscow and All Rus for the entire post-Soviet period, passed away. The formal enthronement of his successor, Kirill I, took place two months later. Informally, Kirill began to exercise effective control over the administration of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) immediately after Aleksii’s death, when the Synod of Bishops named Kirill locum tenens and placed him in charge of organizing the Local Council (pomestnyi sobor) for the purpose of electing a new patriarch.1 Radically different from his predecessor in both the style and content of his administration of the ROC, Kirill I has already managed to move the church-state relationship in the Russian Federation in directions that were only imaginable under Alekseii II and what is more, appeared unrealistic while Vladimir Putin held the presidential office. This paper explores the ways in which the coincidence of the nearly coincidental changeovers in leadership in the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian secular state has already affected Russian federal politics, and speculates as to what it augurs for the future, both near and longterm. In part, the paper is concerned with the question of what the factor of Kirill I as an increasingly major political figure in the firmament of Russian politics means for the stability of the Putin-Medvedev diumvirate; it also asks questions about the long-term implications of the state’s adoption of certain policies promoted by the new patriarch. Because it is concerned with hitting a rapidly moving target, the paper is necessarily speculative in many ways, and does not pretend to be the last word on the subject; it should be read, rather, as an unabashed latter day exercise in Kremlinology that seeks to improve our understanding of the unstable Russian political configuration in the (post) Putin era by adding a perspective that has, to date, been little developed."
"July 19, 2010","This paper develops new theory about the clash of conservative and progressive networks over numerous global issues.  Focusing on the battle over sexual rights at the United Nations, the paper explores how opposing networks shape one another and how their conflict affects policy.  The conflict pits rights advocates, northern European states, and UN bureaucrats against conservative networks spanning the Christian Right, the Vatican, and Islamic states (the “Baptist-burqa” coalition). The broader hypotheses developed in the paper contribute to literatures on social movements, transnational activism, international policymaking, and globalization."
"July 19, 2010","Although we often mention who the leaders are when describing particular political parties, ruling groups, coalitions, administrations, terrorist groups, independence movements, and protest groups, little effort has gone into exploring why leadership might matter in understanding the decisions such entities make ranging from the use of repression and violence to engaging in compromise, accommodation, and consensus building. It is the intention of this paper to push beyond merely acknowledging who is in charge. We propose to examine how learning about leadership can help us gain access to knowledge about the processes occurring within political groups and organizations and their impact on the resulting decisions."
"July 19, 2010","This paper hypothesizes that the ruling elites’ decision to adopt non-violent means of conflict resolution, to militarize a dispute, or to initiate a war is a function of the domestic political context in a given state. More specifically, the degree to which force will be used internationally depends on two variables: (a) the intensity of intra- and/or inter-elite conflict and (b) the degree of elite cohesiveness. This paper proposes that the ruling elites will initiate a war when cohesive elites engage in highly intense inter-elite conflict. Alternatively, the ruling elites will resort to threats or limited use of force abroad when they are fragmented and are passing through a low-intensity intra-elite conflict. Conversely, fragmented elites passing through highly intense intra-elite conflict and cohesive elites passing through low-intensity inter-elite conflict will adopt domestic solutions (i.e., reform, repression, coup, revolution, etc) to address their problems. This hypothesis is examined in the light of two case studies: Chile during the War of the Pacific (1879-1883) and the Peru-Ecuador rivalry during the twentieth century."
"July 19, 2010","Does the promotion of education reduce the risk of the resumption of civil war? As several scholars have noted, civil wars often reoccur as a result of a 'conflict trap' poor countries are more susceptible to civil wars and conflict prone countries are likely to be poor. The promotion of education is seen by many as a way out of this 'conflict trap' First, education is linked with the promotion of civil society, reduces economic inequality, and improves the livelihood of the population (Walter 2004). Moreover, by promoting education, the government signals to the population that is it concerned with the citizens of the country (Thyne 2006). Further, the opportunity for education increases the opportunity costs for rebels to rebel, hence reducing the likelihood that former rebels will reinitiate a conflict (Collier and Hoeffler, 2005; Walter 2004). On the other hand, others have pointed out that education may contribute to conflict particularly if employment opportunities do not keep pace with educational attainment (World Bank 2005; Degu 2005). Despite the claims of a theoretical linkage between education and peace duration, most empirical studies have examined the effects of civil war on education, as opposed to the effects of education on the recurrence of civil conflict (Lai and Thyne 2006; World Bank 2005) or have focused largely on individual cases. In this paper, using hazard analysis, we empirically examine the relationship between increased education enrollments and the likelihood of civil war recurrence from 1990-2008."
"July 19, 2010","Conflict management benefits of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are well established in the international conflict literature. Yet, IGOs’ abilities to address conflicts within member countries are not all that well understood. This is an important omission as most recent conflicts are taking place within – as opposed to between – countries. This paper investigates how well IGOs can help mitigate the problem of armed domestic conflict by focusing specifically on the conflict phase in which low-level violence escalates to civil war. We argue that, despite a large and ever-growing number of IGOs, it is specifically those IGOs with high degrees of institutional depth that have the most impact on the evolution of domestic conflicts. These highly structured IGOs (HSIGOs) are typically most affected by domestic instability in member states, giving them an incentive to address the conflict early on and thus prevent its escalation to civil war. Furthermore, because HSIGOs tend to be more important to and have the leverage to influence member governments’ behavior, they have more ability to pressure the member governments to address grievances of potential rebel groups – lest the IGO sanction and deny privileges of membership to the state due to the conflict. Finally, facing external reputational and material costs for reneging, memberships in HSIGOs serve as credible commitment signals when governments bargain with the rebels to end the conflict. All these functions help reduce the likelihood of conflict escalation to civil war in member countries. Our expectations are confirmed with a series of tests on all domestic conflicts from 1945 to 2000."
"July 19, 2010","Contemporary research on civil war has largely dismissed the role of political and economic grievances, focusing instead on opportunities for conflict. However, these strong claims rest on questionable theoretical and empirical grounds. Previous research has examined primarily the relationship between individual inequality and conflict, and disregarded how the relationship between inequality and ethnic cleavages influence motivation and opportunities for collective action and mobilization. We argue that horizontal inequalities between ethnic groups and states at large can promote ethno-nationalist conflict. Spatial tests using new data on wealth and ethnic groups’ boundaries and political access indicate that those groups that are affluent and poor relative to the national average are both more likely to engage in conflict. Our results remain robust to a number of alternative sample definitions and specifications."
"July 19, 2010","China’s rise has become a defining political phenomenon of world politics in the 21st century. While most scholars debate over what will happen after China rises and how the United States should deal with China’s ascent, we focus on exploring China’s strategic choices in the course of ascent, i.e., how China can rise peacefully? Borrowing insights from the bargaining theory of international conflicts, we argue that China needs to alleviate the information and commitment problems if it intends to rise peacefully. Since 1990, China has conducted two major diplomatic strategies to ensure its peaceful rise: signaling its intentions across the Taiwan Strait and binding its economic and security commitments through various institutions. In the next 20 years, China needs to continue sending a credible signal to the outside world about its peaceful intentions. China should conduct its “core interest diplomacy” with great caution and the core-interest list should be limited and constrained in order to be credible and convincing. In addition, China should initiate a security-community- building process with its neighboring states to strengthen its peaceful rise commitments."
"July 19, 2010","Postconflict peacebuilding can best be described as a form of global governance that emerged during the early 1990s with the objective of ""bringing peace"" and stability to the developing world's war-torn societies that were viewed as increasingly detrimental to national, regional and international security. At its core, the objective of peacebuilding is to transform and remake states and societies into the image of a well-governed, strong state by addressing the governance failures caused by incessant conflict. Because war-torn states are inherently thought to be incapable to reconstructing themselves, international actors, including inter-governmental organizations like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, European Union, an array of international non-governmental organizations and a select group of global powers intervene in the governance and management of war-torn states until they are recognized as stable and able enough to govern themselves at which time they become a ""partner"" in the peacebuilding process. The objective of peacebuilding is focused on rehabilitating the sovereign authority of the state and rebuilding state institutions so that war-torn states have the renewed authority to establish or alter the rules, institutions and processes that govern political and economic decisions and structure state-society interactions. The logic of peacebuilding emphasizes the peace enhancing traits of both democracy and an economic system based on free markets and international trade, which are both believed to foster peace and reduce the risk of future conflict (Paris 2004)."
"July 19, 2010","Terrorist or paramilitary groups waging an armed campaign against the state face a number of important challenges. One of the most crucial is engaging in the tactical use of force without alienating their support base. This study asks what effects, if any, a paramilitary organization’s use of force has on its true support base. Drawing upon an original dataset which combines census, conflict-related violence, and local election data at the district electoral area level for the years 1982-2005 as well as qualitative sources for Northern Ireland, this paper examines the effects of IRA violence on Sinn Féin’s performance at the polls. I show that although the IRA’s use of violence often sparked international and internal condemnation even by moderate Nationalist voters, the organization’s use of violence had little effect on the organization’s genuine support base."
"July 19, 2010","Any electoral institution that aims to sustain peaceful and democratic government after a civil war must enable citizens to overcome two successive problems. First, it must make the distribution of benefits to potential spoilers proportionate to their relative bargaining power, where bargaining power is a function of capabilities to use violence. Second, it must adaptively reallocate spoils over time to accommodate fluctuations in the value of spoils and the violent capabilities of potential spoilers. We examine two polar-opposite kinds of post-conflict institutions – majoritarian electoral institutions and power-sharing institutions – to show how neither is robustly capable of solving the two problems in succession. We propose a “turn-taking” electoral institution that is designed to solve both problems. With this electoral mechanism, the whole executive term goes to a sufficiently inclusive supermajority coalition; if no coalition qualifies, major coalitions take short, alternating turns several times around before the next election. We use a game-theoretic model to formalize our claims about the barriers and pathways to achieving constitutional democracy after civil war."
"July 19, 2010","The paper explores the divergent U.S. integrationist and Chinese coexistence programs of international order. The U.S. program of international order is based on the aspiration to create a unison international order on the basis of the liberal concepts of civil rights, democracy and market economy which is implemented by means of the U.S. alignment system. The Chinese program of international order is based on the aspiration to establish a pluralistic international order on the basis of the concept of peaceful coexistence which is implemented by means of the UN network of multilateral security institutions at global and regional levels. The paper concludes that these programs of international order give rise to an international system without clear rules of the game. This system is unpredictable and expensive to operate in because it does not encompass permanent mechanisms of conflict resolution. However, the U.S., China and the secondary and small powers see this system as relatively beneficial for their interests and values. Consequently, this in between system of disjointed and intersecting practices of international conduct is likely to stay in place for most of the 21st century."
"July 19, 2010","When natural disasters occur in one or both states in an ongoing international rivalry, how does it aect the dynamics of conflict and cooperation between the states? In 1999, a series of earthquakes struck Turkey and and then Greece, coming in the context of decades-long competition and tension between the two states. Similarly, Pakistan and India have been a primary flashpoint of international tension since independence (and fought several wars), and have been disrupted a number of times in recent years by exogenous environmental crises - including the 2001 earthquake in India, the 2010 oods in Pakistan, and the 2005 earthquake in their disputed territory of Kashmir. Such natural disasters and environmental catastrophes are hugely disruptive events. They take lives, destroy resources, incur costs, and fundamentally threaten the security and prosperity of states and their citizens. In both the domestic and international context, this has the potential to greatly shift the relationships and interactions that make up previously stable political and societal equilibria, particularly when they occur in the context of some pre-existing tension."
"July 19, 2010","Why is expansionism absent from the Obama foreign policy agenda? The question seems bizarre precisely because expansionism is so completely absent from US policy discussions. In the modern world, the lack of great-power expansionism in the international system may be overdetermined, but the single strongest deterrent against twenty-first-century expansionism is likely the US commitment to oppose it. This commitment, repeatedly confirmed both through military actions like the Gulf War and consistent diplomatic rhetoric, is rooted in the commitment of the US to reject expansionism in its own foreign policy. It is therefore not a stretch to say that much of the stability of the current international system is the result of the US decision to forgo expansionism in its own foreign policy, a decision that represented a 180° turn from the aggressive expansionism of early US foreign policy (despite Jefferson‘s words quoted above). Obviously, this decision cannot be explained by the US‘ own deterrent power, but neither can it be fully explained by any of the other major arguments concerning the current stability in the modern literature. This paper offers an answer to the question of why expansionism faded from US foreign policy after its heyday in the early 1800s."
"July 19, 2010","This paper seeks to explain variation in state-building outcomes under foreign occupations. Why do some state-building missions produce long-lasting institutional transformation, while others leave a legacy of failed institutions? I explore this question through a comparative study of the American colonization of the Philippines (1898-1941) and the Japanese colonization of Taiwan (1895-1945), which produced contrasting state-building outcomes despite having similar background conditions. In contrast to recent work in post-conflict studies that emphasizes state-building intensity and institutional design, this paper focuses on process - the process through which foreign agents transform war-torn or traditional societies into modern states. I argue that two key factors affect the ability of occupiers to integrate new rules and organizational structures into the existing institutions of a target society to create a functional state: (i) the extent of discretionary authority granted to the occupational regime by its home government and (ii) the ability of native elites to interfere with the institution-building effort. The greater freedom foreign agents have to engage in on-the-ground experimentation, the more likely they are to successfully integrate new institutions into the native social order. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, the most effective institutions emerge when native elites possess the capacity to veto the institution-building program of foreign agents. Only when new institutions are undergirded by the self-serving interests of local powerholders do they become enforceable, for foreign occupiers lack both the manpower and the legitimacy necessary to compel widespread compliance to new rules."
"July 19, 2010","Insurgent operational claims in Iraq are analyzed from the perspective that such claims can help illuminate the internal structure of an insurgency, especially in situations of intense factional competition between rival groups. Our primary focus is on the types of target classes that different insurgent groups claim to attack and claims of joint operations between insurgent groups. The former allows us to construct a targeting policy variable and the latter enables us to construct a network of relationships between insurgent groups, particularly at the foot soldier level. We contend that variations in the claimed target classes should reflect differences in group composition. Correlations between targeting policy and the joint operations network structure support this hypothesis. We also present a model of insurgent cooperation with respect to joint operations.  In addition to a homophily process driven by targeting policy proximity, the model posits both a horizontal interaction mechanism – that foot soldier units can initiate joint operations with units from other insurgent groups – and a hierarchical one in which the network linking the leaderships of insurgent groups also plays a role. Simulation results indicate a good ability to match the structure of the observed networks."
"July 19, 2010","Our paper is motivated by the rationalism/constructivism contrast in the International Relations (IR) field. By reinterpreting this contrast we seek to redirect reflection about theoretical synthesis in the field. Our argument has four steps. First, we introduce a broader intellectual setting for the rationalism/constructivism contrast by situating it as a contemporary iteration of the economic/sociological contrast classically articulated throughout the history of the modern social sciences. Second, we pragmatically give concrete content to each side of this contrast in relation to recent IR. Engagement with Weber and Parsons helps us to subdivide the economic side into parametric vs. strategic variants, and the sociological in terms of traditional vs. value-rational action. Third, we argue that synthesis of economic and sociological approaches is both viable and desirable in concrete studies of strategic interaction. Fourth, to conclude, we compare our argument to recent efforts to promote analytic eclecticism in political science."
"July 19, 2010","Many states justify their use of technology and tactics as consistent with international law. These appeals to legitimacy suggest that legal norms serve some role in limiting the use of force, particularly in promoting discrimination between combatants and civilians. The United States justifies drone attacks as more efficient means than the use of troops to attack suspected terrorists. Many civilian and military leaders argue that these attacks are more moral than alternative tactics because they target the individuals directly responsible for attacks on the United States and its allies. However, these justifications assume that the military has accurate intelligence. However, in Afghanistan, the military has killed many civilians in misdirected attacks. Why do civilian and military leaders contend that they have accurate intelligence when the empirical record shows that often information is erroneous and leads to unnecessary destruction and civilian casualties?"
"July 19, 2010","Theories of international relations have often incorporated time horizons — a metaphor for the value actors’ place on the future relative to the present. However, they have rarely drawn from a growing body of experimental research that studies how human beings actually think about the future and how this affects their decision-making in the present. In this paper, we present relevant findings from psychology and behavioral economics, notably those of “construal level theory” (CLT), and explore these findings’ implications for three classic questions of international relations theory — cooperation, conflict, and compliance; preventive war; and coercion. We argue that experimental evidence regarding how people discount future value and construe future events challenges both neorealist and neoliberal approaches to international cooperation. We further maintain that CLT helps explain a longstanding puzzle about preventive wars — namely, why they are often initiated too late by declining powers but too soon by rising competitors. Finally, we rely on these empirical findings to explain who wins coercive contests and why compellence is often, but not always, harder than deterrence. We advise scholars of international relations and international security to pay closer attention to their assumptions about time horizons, and we suggest that these assumptions be grounded in what we know about actual human decision-making."
"July 19, 2010","What will we do once we withdraw from Gaza and find, as we inevitably will, that Arafat or his successors have stepped in and the squads of terrorists are again operating from there into Israel, murdering and destroying? What will we do when the Katyusha fire starts hitting Sderot… and Ashkelon… and Kiryat Gat…. Will the television pictures showing us shelling Gaza in return be more palatable than those as showed us in front of Beirut, or less upsetting than those of Israeli troops battling West Bank rioters?"
"July 19, 2010","In bargaining models of internal ethno-territorial conflicts, variation in leadership preferences has a significant impact on expected conflict outcomes. Relative power has an impact conditional on leadership preferences. Conflict among cost-conscious narrow nationalists is expected to be relatively peaceful and episodic - in a manner that is weakly but not perfectly correlated with variation in relative power. Conflict involving cost-flouting extremists is likely to be protracted, irrespective of relative power. Conflict involving power-seekers that care only about internal political effects of conflict may mimic either or both of the other two outcomes. Bargaining outcomes are further constrained by the relative indivisibility of contested homeland territory. A resulting four-fold typology of conflicts is then applied to case studies from Russia and the former Yugoslavia. The case studies illustrate the expected variation in conflict types - including the conditional effects of relative power differences."
"July 19, 2010","Which actions by governments stoke or pacify an insurgency? Scholarly research on the topic has often been relegated to the study of this question at the country level, comparing across large units and rarely looking inside the state.   Our research focuses on the primary actors in a contest for authority within a state: the government, dissidents, and the population. In contrast to much previous work, we tackle the difficult question of how population dynamics affect the rise and fall of insurgency. We investigate the question in the context of India and its states and territories. India is particularly well suited to this research as it presently experiences terrorism, insurgency, ethnic conflict, riots and other actions that threaten the stability of the state.  Using an agent-based model (ABM), geographic information systems (GIS), data on public sentiment, and events data, we address this question from a multidisciplinary approach. The agent-based model formalizes the interactions of states, dissidents, and the population, the GIS framework allows for actual demographic and geographic information to influence this interaction, and the events data and sentiment data allow us to test empirical implications from the model directly. As the NSF-Minerva grant is midstream, this paper reports initial work to couple the ABM and empirical analysis. We expect the results to have important implications for the study of political violence, order, and state-building. The approach is policy relevant, furthermore, and can be adapted to other regions and countries."

It will then provide a brief narrative history of the Clinton Administration’s relationship with the Taliban government, particularly as it pertains to diplomatic recognition.  Third, it will show how this decision fits into a classical realist model of recognition."
"July 19, 2010","In this paper we examine whether mutual optimism can be supported as a cause of war in models that permit the unilateral use of force. Previous work (Fey and Ramsay, 2007) has demonstrated that war cannot occur in any game in which both sides must agree in order to fight. With the more realistic assumption that either side can unilaterally use force, however, war is possible in equilibrium. But we show that mutual optimism is still not a valid explanation for war, because it is neither always necessary or sufficient for war in a wide range of models. In particular, we show that this is true for a broad class of models with unilateral force as well as bargaining models."
"July 19, 2010","This paper investigates to which degree political parties in the fifteen old EU member states have mobilized Euroscepticism. Contrary to the prevailing view, neither national politics, nor orientations regarding Europe are one-dimensional. From this perspective, the EU-issue does not necessarily crosscut national lines of conflict. Rather, economic and cultural forms of Euroscepticism map quite nicely onto the state-market cleavage and the new cultural dimension structuring party systems in Western Europe. In principle, therefore, the congruence of European and national preference spaces favors the representation of differing preferences over Europe. Furthermore, the empirical analysis based on individual-level data from the European Value Study shows that a potential for parties to differentiate their appeals with respect to Europe exists throughout the continent."
"July 19, 2010","Although scholars have been dissecting the Cuban missile crisis for almost half a century, this paper argues that we have learned the wrong intelligence lessons and neglected many important ones. Organizations explain why. Ever since Graham Allison’s Essence of Decision, scholars have concentrated on the pitfalls of individual perception and cognition while paying little attention to organizational weaknesses in intelligence. As a result, researchers have considered the crisis a stunning intelligence success instead of a stunning intelligence warning failure. And they have overlooked the silent but deadly organizational weaknesses that led analysts to make the wrong call."
"July 19, 2010","Existing scholarship has characterized the severity of and mechanisms behind the problem of conflict contagion, in which armed conflict perpetuates further conflict in neighboring states. Although studies of peacekeeping have demonstrated that it can prevent conflict recurrence, we know little about whether international actors can also help prevent conflict from spreading. Using event history analysis that incorporates information from neighboring observations, the empirical findings indicate that the risk of contagion decreases by about 80% in the presence of peacekeeping. Moreover, both lighter and more substantial peacekeeping deployments can prevent conflict spread. One of the key means by which peacekeeping helps contain conflict is through restricting external harboring of and support for transnational insurgencies."
"July 19, 2010","Something certainly appears to have changed in Thai politics. The country once noted for its contented citizenry and “politically inert social groups” (Anek 1988) is awash in a sea of red and yellow shirts, and teetering, many fear, on the brink of civil war. Since the end of 2005 Thailand has been the poster-child for political instability, with 4 elections (with a fifth likely by year’s end), 3 constitutions, 4 forced party dissolutions (with a fifth threatening), and 6 different heads of government. Explanations of the recent turmoil tend to emphasize the effect of new levels of mass mobilization, the gap between rich and poor, urban and rural, the changing nature of the monarchy, or personality conflicts. These all play a role, to be sure. However, the catalyst that has turned long-simmering tensions into an increasingly intractable political conflict is a change to the Thai party system. Specifically, in contrast to the partisan dealignment or realignment in much of the world, we have witnessed the nascent development of partisan identities among Thai voters over the past decade. This mass partisan alignment, as much as anything, has upset the equilibrium of Thai politics — transforming what was once an inefficient but modest-stakes game of political horse-trading into a zero sum game with extremely high stakes."
"July 19, 2010","The long and uneasy relationship between Ahmadiyah and mainstream Muslims took a turn during the period between 1980 and 2005 when the MUI (Indonesian Ulama Council) issued edicts (fatwa) on the heresy of Ahmadiyah. After these consecutive edicts were publicly declared, the Ahmadis became the major target of persecution, and violent attacks. In Lombok in particular Ahamadi followers were forced to leave their destroyed houses, mosques and schools to live as refugees in a public shelter. This paper is a study of the Ahmadiyah sect and the basis of its beliefs. It also traces the origin and development of the sect in Indonesia and the subsequent debates and controversy which led to the religious group being “de-legitimized” by the state. This paper argues that government interference in the definition of officially acceptable religion has heightened religious violence. The research also reveals how government treats Ahmadiyah refugees who for so long have become the victims or the silent majority of this conflict."
"July 19, 2010","During the first decade of the 21st century, politics in Taiwan became increasing polarized over the strongly interlinked issues of national identity and cross-Strait relations. Given the balance of power that existed during the 2000-2008 period, between the Pan-Green coalition led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that controlled the Executive branch under President Chen Shui-bian and the Pan-Blue coalition led by the Kuomintang (KMT) that controlled the legislature, this produced policy gridlock and increasingly vicious politics. This situation, in turn, created serious problems for Taiwan as it faced “hard times” at the dawn of the new century in two distinct areas. First, it made responding to China’s challenge to Taiwan’s sovereignty difficult because of the intense partisan dispute over what policy toward the PRC should be. Similarly, Taiwan’s growing economic integration with China over the last two decades meant that any discussion of economic policy, which became vital at the time of the Great Recession of 2008-10, quickly became inflamed with the emotional battle over national identity. Yet, the vicious polarization over national identity does not appear to have been preordained as the central dynamic in Taiwan politics. Indeed, the “median” voter appears to be in a moderate middle on this issue rather than falling into two bipolar extremes. This paper, then, examines the strident debate over national identity."
"July 19, 2010","During the millennium 250 B.C. to 750 A.D., China’s long-run economic performance was characterized by a self-sufficient agrarian economy with per-capita GDP and population remaining more or less constant. In the mid-8th century AD, a major civil war initiated a transition away from a self-sufficient agrarian economy towards industrialization. Throughout China, local commercial markets appeared, developed and interconnected, creating national markets for some goods. Commerce and industry appeared on an unprecedented scale and the pace of technological innovation increased. These developments continued and accelerated during the 1000 – 1300 A.D. period, during which time per-capita GDP and population roughly doubled and China emerged as the world’s technological leader. This raises an important question in political economy: “What gave rise to China’s early Industrial Revolution of 1000 – 1300?” I argue that from the civil war period (755 – 763 A.D.) the political acceptance of regional military governors throughout China changed the power structure of Chinese society. This led to an important change in the property right system, protecting commercial and industrial interests, which gave rise to China’s early Industrial Revolution."
"July 19, 2010","Between the 1898 and 1941 American foreign policy was much more restrained than other great powers and rising powers of this era despite the fact that the USA had the largest economy and highest rate of economic growth among the great powers. Therein lies a puzzle of considerable historical and theoretical significance. Classical/neoclassical and offensive realists would expect a rising power to be especially expansionist in its foreign policy, and yet the U.S. never even matched the imperialism of tiny Belgium. Defensive realists expect states to expand to meet emerging threats, yet the U.S. retrenched in the face of great power aggression. Constructivists would expect an emerging power to conform to the norms of the system, in this case great power imperialism, but clearly the U.S. did not. Liberal theories focusing on economic interests fail to convincingly demonstrate that American foreign policy conforms to the interests of any specific economic group. The anomalous behavior of the United States from 1898 to 1941 suggests the need for greater attention to variables not included in the dominant approaches to international relations. To explain this anomaly, I utilize a liberal-institutional theory of foreign policy, which argues that a fragmented, decentralized, “liberal” state structure will tend to pursue a policy of relative strategic restraint. More specific to the case under study, separation of powers and a geographically decentralized electoral system restrained American expansion during the initial drive for imperialism and fostered rollback of the limited expansion that did occur. This essay shows that domestic institutions and liberal norms fostered strategic restraint in American foreign policy during the height of American imperialism from 1904 to 1912."
"July 19, 2010","How does the United States relate to the West? We tend, in the IR literature, to think about it in terms of the “ordering” of the West: Is it a civilization, an empire, a strategic bargain, a security community, or something else? Will the West hold together or break apart, and — putting the same question in a different form — can the United States continue to exercise leadership of the West? Much of our thinking about these questions is based on the assumptions that there is a coherent, singular West, and that the US relates to that western community in a coherent, singular way. But as Peter Katzenstein has argued, the West is both plural and pluralist, and the United States “fits” into the West in a variety of different ways, revealing many different sides of itself in the process. We begin here with the expectation that closer, comparative examination of the way that the US relates to specific partners can help us to untangle some of these complexities and contradictions."
"July 19, 2010","Rebel groups exhibit significant variation in their treatment of civilians, with profound humanitarian consequences. This paper proposes a new theory of rebel group behavior based on resources and delegation within rebel organizations. Rebel leaders have incentives to maintain order in their territories but are constrained in their ability to control group members. Leaders establish control through spot payments and promises of future rewards to top commanders. The leader's ability to offer these incentives  is determined by the group's partnerships with external patrons. The theory's implications are examined through a spatial analysis of Liberia's civil war using an original dataset derived through remote sensing methods."
"July 19, 2010","This paper draws on the concepts of omnibalancing and counterbalancing to explain how and why states develop and use nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, also called weapons of mass destruction (WMD), for regime security purposes. According to omnibalancing, leaders of developing states use alliances with outside powers to balance against not only external threats, but also internal threats to their rule. According to counterbalancing, authoritarian states design their military and security forces to ensure regime survival instead of maximizing their effectiveness on the battlefield against foreign enemies. This project uses insights from these two concepts, and the broader school of neoclassical realism, to evaluate the role of regime security in a state’s development of WMD.  Chemical and biological weapons programs have played a greater role than commonly realized in safeguarding regimes against internal threats. Chemical and biological weapon programs have been used to conduct counterinsurgency operations, carry out assassinations, bolster coup-proofing mechanisms, and to protect the leadership from assassination. By describing a new variable that influences a state’s WMD decision-making process, this research contributes to a better understanding of why states develop, use, and retain these weapons. Omission of regime security as a motive for WMD proliferation may lead to the overestimation of the importance of other causal variables. An improved understanding of incentives for proliferation is a prerequisite to designing effective nonproliferation strategies."
"July 19, 2010","Since the Japanese defeat in WWII, the strategic relationship between Japan and the United States has evolved slowly and erratically toward a more assertive Japanese posture vis-a-vie its partner. Thus, providing an interesting case study of evolving alliance behavior when the subordinate state changes its views and, in doing so, changes the dynamics between the partners. Space activities provide a distinct window into that evolving relationship because it combines security, economic and global status questions. Japanese space activities were long constrained due to constitutional proscriptions against military activities of which the dual Use aspect of space technologies was considered a prime example. In 1969, the Diet passed legislation prohibiting any defense force Use of space technologies. Thus, Japan depended on the U.S. for its external security while space activities were initially restricted to space activities starting in 1955. After Sputnik, the U.S. established a dominant position relative to Japanese space activities outside of space science. Efforts by Japan to establish an independent status in space activities were successfully blocked through licensing agreements regarding space launchers and restrictions on how Japanese communications satellites were marketed, both kept Japan subordinate to the U.S. This situation endured until the 1990s when Japan embarked on development of its H-II rocket, a direct challenge to American dominance over space launch. Furthermore, in 1998, the trauma of a failed North Korean “satellite launch” over Japan forced re-evaluation of its posture regarding space activities and by extension its relationship with the U.S."
"July 19, 2010","The goal of Korean reunification, enshrined in South Korea's constitution, could in principle be achieved in one of two ways: a confederation agreement between the South Korean government and the North Korean regime that preserves Northern elites, and a unilateral absorption of the North in which the North's population and territory would be directly incorporated into the South Korean political system. We posit a general theory of national reunification agreements that begins with the assumption that two regimes - one secure and one insecure - bargain over both a potential political settlement as well as for direct control of resources, and that this bargaining continues if the regimes merge via a confederation but ends if one absorbs the other. Confederation, which occurs when one regime offers a bargain and the other accepts it, both results from bargaining and shapes future bargaining. Our theory has several observable implications: reunification happens via confederation when the divided regimes are both stable, when they have similar political systems, when reunification would not change the weaker regime's ties to an outside ally, and when the stronger regime has a history of credible commitments to previous agreements with the weaker regime. Our theoretical logic explains why South Korea began to propose a confederation to the North from 1989 and why a confederation agreement will be unlikely to be made between the two sides. We conclude that the current South Korean approach appears moving from a policy of seeking confederation to one of preparing for absorption, but that absorption is a dangerous strategy. Therefore, the fundamental dilemma that South Korean governments have faced is the discrepancy between envisioning reunification and choosing available policy options."

"July 19, 2010","Abstract: The future of international politics hinges on the behavior of the rising powers. Today, all eyes are on non-Western rising powers, most notably China and India. When the rising powers are examined as a class of states, two empirical trends emerge. First, these states are not pursuing a balancing strategy; second, they are pursuing a strategy of integration into the Western liberal order. Realist unipolar theory explains the ‘missing balance.’ But unipolar theory is not helpful in explaining why rising powers have pursued a bonding strategy, or institutional and economic integration. This article seeks to explain the bonding behavior of rising powers by developing a liberal systemic theory."

"July 19, 2010","The paper examines the impact of the global economic crisis on the development of Russia’s security policy in Asia. In the final years of Vladimir Putin's presidency (2007-08), the Russian leadership made a dramatic reassessment of major global trends, sources of power, security threats, and the roles of key actors in the changing international environment. On the doctrinal level, the contours of the Kremlin’s new eastern policy has been consistent during the tenure of Dmitri Medvedev, Putin’s successor in the Kremlin. Three major developments predetermined the strengthening of the “Asian component” of Russian foreign and security strategy. Firstly, Russia’s “new globalist” approach to world politics which links national interest to the restoration of Russia’s global competitiveness and a great power status. Secondly, the imperative of modernization which requires Russia’s imminent integration into the global economic space filled with multiple geoeconomic risks and security threats. Thirdly, domestic political issues in the spheres of political control, administrative efficiency and development, critical for the interpretation of national security priorities by ruling political and business elites, especially prior to the new electoral cycle in 2011-12. The paper overviews these three groups of factors, demonstrating their impact on the Kremlin leadership and its policies aimed at Russia’s adjustment to the dynamic Asian security environment."

Through an investigation of the relationship between service and sacrifice on the one hand and civic membership on the other, readers will be better situated to think through the meaning of sacrifice in the current set of military engagements and how this builds on a long tradition in American history. The paper critically questions the relationship between civic status and civic performance."
"July 19, 2010","Providing assurances about security to another state or states is a potentially useful technique for achieving defense and foreign policy goals. Security assurances play an especially prominent role in the nuclear nonproliferation regime. Empirical research remains limited, however, on the conditions that affect the effectiveness of security assurances. This paper seeks to clarify the different forms of assurance and to present preliminary hypotheses on the factors that affect how successful assurance strategies will be in promoting nonproliferation."
"July 19, 2010","The objective of this paper is to analyze the conditions necessary for an external actor to successfully help establish security between a government and an opposition group during or post- conflict. The paper focuses on determining what combination of mechanisms it takes for an external actor, particularly states or international government organizations, to help facilitate stability that lasts after the external actor leaves. For this end, the paper uses a game theoretic model to help develop a theory of self-enforcing stability, and provides preliminary quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of this theory based on a case study analysis of the US involvement in Iraq between 2006 and 2008."
"July 19, 2010","Several scholars have tried to import arguments about selection effects from the literature on deterrence crises into the context of studies of economic sanctions. They claim that datasets of economic sanctions episodes oversample highly motivated target states, because less motivated targets should be expected to concede invisibly at the threat stage, before sanctions are imposed. As a result, they claim that sanctions are really more effective than they appear. However, the structure of the strategic interaction in economic sanctions cases does not exactly mirror the structure in deterrence crises, so we should not expect to find the same selection effect. This article explains the differences and their implications for empirical studies of economic sanctions effectiveness."
"July 19, 2010","In the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the study of separatist conflict has been dominated both geographically and theoretically by post-communist cases (see for example Hale 2008; Jenne 2007; Roeder 2007; Toft 2003). Frequently, however, the efforts to extend arguments based on the post-communist experience to the post-colonial world come up short. I argue in this essay that the lack of fit is due largely to the mechanisms by which coherent, durable ethnic identities emerged and were contested inside and outside the communist bloc. Inside the communist bloc, ethno-federalism combined with heavy-handed direct rule generated or reinforced ethnic identities at the titular republican level. On the contrary, ethno-federalism in the post-colonial world (i.e. India and Ethiopia) has generally been a post-colonial state response to early separatist mobilization rather than a cause of it. Moreover, the same early post-colonial rebellions against direct rule have catalyzed long-term trajectories of contentious ethnic politics, but did so only in the context of vertical ethnic ties that enabled collective action in the absence of political organizations. Drawing on two different global datasets and a number of original variables, I show a modest cross-regional difference in the role of past rebellion in shaping separatism and a strong cross-regional difference in the effect of ethno-federalism on nation-state crisis inside and outside the former communist bloc. Where prominent post-Soviet studies find ethno-federal institutions to be at the “front” of their explanations, I suggest that, in the post-colonial world, such institutions have nearly always been endogenous to nationalist mobilization."
"July 19, 2010","Existing conceptions of the liberal peace tend to emphasize the marginal effect of democracy, and assume that democracy has a homogeneous effect, independent of other attributes of states or dyads. We argue that a more meaningful assessment of the potential role of liberalism in international politics must consider net effects, taking into account differences in other features affecting state behavior, and how the effects of liberal factors may differ for small and large states. We show that common mechanisms highlighted in research on the liberal peace are unlikely to apply with equal force to large and small states. Large states are likely to be more insular, with a much higher capacity for unilateral action, and generally less interested in international cooperation. We show empirically that whereas standard liberal peace claims about the effects of democracy may characterize small democracies, large democracies tend to fight much more than the average for non-democracies."
"July 19, 2010","The end of the Cold War led to predictions that a new balance of power would soon emerge to counter the dominance of the United States. When that expected balancing behavior did not materialize, explanations of the enduring unipolar situation arose, including the benign nature of American hegemony and the centrality of the public goods that it provides, or the massive gap in capabilities between the United States and any combination of potential challengers that essentially precludes balancing. After the US-led invasion of Iraq, however, some argued that the long-anticipated return of balance of power was at hand in the form of “soft balancing.”  Soft balancing is distinct from traditional balancing behavior in that it does not seek to openly balance through alliance formation or an increase in military capabilities aimed against the predominant power. Instead, soft balancing is comprised of a range of activities designed to frustrate the ability of the predominant power to act with impunity, in particular by using international institutions to deny it international legitimacy for its actions. The actions of the United States in the wake of September 11th are said to have accelerated this trend toward soft balancing by weakening confidence in its image as a benign hegemon, thus generating soft balancing by states such as France, Germany, Russia and China."
"July 19, 2010","We provide the first experimental results on a two-stage model of militarized conflict based on the ubiquitous ultimatum bargaining game that dominates much of the theoretical analysis of international relations.  We illustrate how data from experimental trials deviate from the equilibrium predictions from both a complete information version of the model and the quantal response version of the model.  We discuss how the results from the experiments can inform future theoretical, empirical, and experimental work on bargaining theories of war."

"July 19, 2010","In his Nobel acceptance speech on December 10th, President Obama stated firmly: “. . . make no mistake: evil does exist in the world.”  And no matter what they came to think of his ‘axis of evil” policies, very few Americans disagreed with President Bush on the night of 9/11 when he told us: “Today, our nation saw evil.”  These instances of politicians on the world stage freely using the term “evil” suggest a near universal acceptance of the existence of evil in the world. Yet, political science rarely examines the role of evil in politics and political science classes rarely deal with the subject. If we accept the existence of such a phenomenon, and leave the debate over the root of evil to the theologians, political scientists are left to answer a very important question: what is the impact of evil on the collective actions of humans in the political realm? Through the use of a case study this paper explores the creation of a class in political science that aims to engage students in answering this question."
"July 19, 2010","What is the relationship between civil war and terrorism? Recent attempts to unpack the similarities between these types of political violence have either focused on creating actor-based categories (terrorists vs. insurgents) and elucidating the different reasons for being one or the other or comparing and contrasting each to discern whether they have similar etiologies. In contrast to previous approaches, we use geo-referenced terror event data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to show where and when terror happens and whether it occurs inside or outside of civil war zones. We investigate in detail six separate violent campaigns to illustrate some of the patterns in terrorism and civil war events. While the study of terrorism and civil war mostly occurs in separate scholarly communities, we argue for more work that incorporates insights from each research program, and we offer an exciting possibility for future research by merging geo-referenced terror and civil war data."
"July 19, 2010","How can we best understand the role of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in international politics? In contrast to much of the current literature in international relations, which focuses on the role of ideas in international politics, I argue that the material characteristics of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons are a fundamental determinant of the role played by these weapons in international politics. In particular, this paper argues that structural realism, with its focus on military utility, offers a better explanation of state use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons than do explanations that focus on norms. The focus is on explaining the pattern of use of these weapons on the battlefield or as a strategic deterrent, not on explaining individual cases. In addition, I compare across chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in order to increase the number of cases and generate variation in military utility and norms."
"July 19, 2010","Although democracy may survive in Iraq and Afghanistan after the departure of American troops, the bureaucratic infrastructure of both states remains in a questionable state at best. To what extent should competent bureaucracy-building, rather than democracy promotion, figure into plans to peacefully reintegrate these and other similarly broken societies? The original American focus on democracy-building was premised on the findings of Democratic Peace theory. According to the causal logic presented by various forms of Democratic Peace theory, democracies possess unique information-generation advantages in international bargaining. This allows them to achieve bargains with other states peaceably. However, a key element has been missing from these existing theories: what explains whether the high-quality information signalled by democracies will be correctly understood? The existing literature assumes that the generation of dependable signals is problematic, while their reception is not. I construct a theory of information reception premised on the intuition that states possessing high-quality bureaucracies will be better able to read the signalled intentions of other states. I expect that states with meritocratic and efficient bureaucratic structures to read signals more accurately than states with weakly professionalized bureaucracies. The end result is that states with effective bureaucracies will be in a position to read credible signals accurately and thereby avoid the crisis bargaining deadlock associated with outbreaks of interstate violence. I explore my theory quantitatively by modeling Militarized Interstate Dispute initiation in a dataset of all Directed-Dyad Years from 1950-2000. In the end, I find that the addition of a bureaucratic ""information processing"" element to Oneal & Russett's (2001) canonical model of the Democratic Peace yields substantively interesting significant results. However, these results cast a dark cloud on the possible futures of post-occupation Iraq and Afghanistan."
"July 19, 2010","The world has adopted democratization as the prescription for peace in intrastate conflicts, but democratization often leads to more war instead. One reason might be difficulty in developing a politically engaged constituency for peace that is ready to guide and pressure political leaders towards a consolidated peace. In less democratic and less developed societies, peace-oriented civil society may take considerable time to develop the capacity for political influence. How does political engagement for peace develop in democratizing societies? Is its speed or nature affected by the level of democratization? Supposing political engagement in private is less risky than in public, is it more likely to begin in private in less democratic societies? And do peace groups use private political engagement as a stepping stone to public political engagement, or does public political engagement require a different set of peace groups to develop? How do political opportunity structure, societal and organizational resources, and organizational legitimacy and ideology affect private and public political engagement in democratizing societies?"
"July 19, 2010","The discursive landscape in Ecuador is marked, on the one hand, by an antagonistic and dialogic interaction between official claims and the critical discourses of a variety of distinct but overlapping social movements, namely the environmental, anti-mining, anti-oil and indigenous movements. On the other hand, these same dialogic encounters manifest themselves between different elements of the state itself, generating a politically productive ambiguity around what constitutes the official position on resource extraction and environmental policy. Both the increasingly tense conflict between movements and the state, most recently in the form of the heightened criminalization of protest, and the discursive ambivalence of the Correa administration, point to the centrality of language and meaning as sites of political contestation, as the uneven terrain of domination and resistance. That the positions that constitute this terrain are not only fundamentally relational, but dynamic, is demonstrated by the unforeseen and inventive uses of both official and critical discourses. Formulations that originated as critiques of the state find themselves unexpectedly incorporated into the latter’s repertoire of justification. At the same time, social movement organizations continually reclassify and redescribing state activities, shifting the site of conflict to a new set of terms: thus the neoliberal state becomes the extractive state and ‘sustainability’ is revealed as a codeword for the expansion of mining activity. This rewriting of the terms of debate is a continually unfolding process that coalesces around salient terms, and that at certain conjunctures erupts into physical confrontations, arrests, roadblocks, and paramilitary deployments. These latter serve as a new ground for political conflict, a new economy of stakes and risks, of possibilities and defeats, and demands a new language to render the emerging array of forces intelligible."
"July 19, 2010","Civil wars are more frequent and longer than interstate wars. While these differences have held across the last 200 years, since World War II, they have become much more profound. We develop a formal model to explain how actions by the international community can prevent violent conflict. Our model focuses on the impact of international intervention — in particular, interventions that are much more powerful than the capabilities of the actors involved. When those interventions become more likely, actors see less advantage from fighting and so conflict does not happen. We argue that this level of intervention explains the decrease in the incidence of interstate wars, relative to civil wars, and also can explain when interstate wars do happen and when civil wars do not."

"July 19, 2010","Counterinsurgency and peacekeeping, despite their obvious differences, share many similarities.  This paper argues that those similarities are due in large part to the demands of attaining legitimacy for the interveners themselves and for the government or post-war political system they are trying to support.  At the same time, that government is an independent actor which may be acting in ways that undermine the legitimacy of both it and the interveners.  These pressures lead each of the military operations to certain shared similarities.  A brief examination of this argument, in light of the use of force, is presented."
"July 19, 2010","The manner in which a country gains independence has been shown to affect conflict propensity. Maoz (1989, 1996) provides evidence that revolutionary state formation is associated with militarized interstate violence. This paper builds upon previous studies on state formation in two ways. First, it attempts to replicate findings on state formation affecting interstate disputes. Second, it argues that violent state formation can also affect foreign interventions and civil war onsets. Neither of these two topics had received much attention theoretically or empirically despite the fact that there is considerable anecdotal evidence that many of the countries that were formed violently have experienced more than their fair share of civil wars and interventions. Considerable amount of empirical support is found for the argument that state formation affects violence in all but one situation."
"July 19, 2010","In contrast to the theme of this conference, this paper argues that international crisis is not sufficient to explain the U.S. Army’s recent acceptance of counterinsurgency warfare and nation building as core capabilities.  I contend instead that this change in Army thinking would not have been possible without a long-term erosion of the Army’s dominant discourse, which held that the military’s responsibility was to fight wars, not to transform politics and society.  This process was decades in the making. Only after substantial shifts in the language officers and soldiers used to describe the Army’s mission was a group of officers and experts from inside and outside the government able to institutionalize a new discourse effacing the barrier between war and politics."

The paper argues that American use of force is the result of a balance of interests and accessibility, both emerging from geopolitical theory."

There has been little discernible movement in this direction; to the contrary, the United States has pursued a consistent grand strategy of primacy since at least the end of the cold war.  To advise that America should adopt restraint implies that it can do so.  I argue that as a result of the lack of powerful structural pressures on the United States, as well as the alignment of domestic foreign policy inputs within it, Washington is unlikely to adopt a grand strategy of restraint.  Ironically, structural realists should pay more attention to the structure of domestic politics if they seek dramatic changes in U.S. grand strategy."
"July 19, 2010","We use original survey data and administrative data from post-war Liberia to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping's well-documented association with more durable peace.  We identify local impacts of deployment bases by exploiting the fact that peacekeepers had limited information when selecting base localities, using coarsened exact matching to identify sets of communities that should have been equally likely to receive bases, and then using regression to clean up residual imbalances."
"July 19, 2010","The notion that war can be explained in terms of bargaining breakdown has led to many interesting insights into the causes of war. A separate strand of literature in comparative politics argues that variations in the domestic tax contract shape domestic regime stability. Our paper combines these insights in a model of domestic fiscal policy-making and international bargaining. Our model shows how the sustainability of each of these bargains – the domestic tax contract between state and society and the implicit negotiated international settlement over the global distribution of territory and economic wealth – is jointly determined. Governments’ international negotiations are tied to their revenue raising strategies and those strategies in turn may be shaped by external security concerns. We find that conditions that loosen fiscal constraints on the government may result in commitment problem driven wars, particularly when one adversary still faces substantial fiscal constraints on its ability to fund military expenditure. Our theory has implications for reinterpreting domestic and international relations in several historical eras, including the periods immediately before and after World War I and the onset and conclusion of the Cold War. We discuss these cases and explain how the logic of our model sheds new light on existing interpretations of these historical events."

"July 19, 2010","The United States maintains two distinct armies: an active duty, or force under federal control, and a National Guard nominally under state control with the option of being federalized. This bifurcation of the American military remains largely unchanged since the nation’s founding. Given the inclination of policymakers to centralize power under conditions of existential threat or disaster, this continued division of the armed forces is puzzling. What explains the durability of the two armies and their ability to adapt to new or qualitatively different roles over time? This paper develops a conceptual framework that seeks to explain agency adaptation and durability. I theorize that when faced with new or qualitatively different demands from policymakers, agencies bargain with their overseers for resources and institutional changes that facilitate adaptation and mitigate stressors. The agency’s political environment, particularly institutional arrangements and ideational factors, mediates agency adaptation by expanding or curtailing an agency’s range of response, further influencing the nature of the principal-agent bargain. I briefly consider cases that illustrate this conceptual framework as it relates to the durability of the two armies and propose avenues for future research."
"July 19, 2010","This article seeks to generate a more precise understanding of the emergence and perpetuation of warlords.  First, it offers a simple, intuitive, and empirically grounded conceptual definition of warlordism.  Second, it argues that the primary factor contributing to the success of warlords is the ability to take advantage of a price differential for political, economic, and cultural goods across terrains — in a word, to engage in arbitrage.  Third, it illustrates this model with a case study of Khun Sa (1934-2007), the self-proclaimed Shan freedom-fighter and “king” of Burma’s heroin trade.  Finally, it suggests that the international community rethink its commitment to the norm of sovereignty in order to combat the proliferation of such non-state violence-wielders."
"July 19, 2010","The concepts of sovereignty and power provide a leitmotif in Krasner’s contributions to international relations. The incisive and original insights of sovereignty as “organized hypocrisy” have helped illuminate important dilemmas in world politics. But how states manage dilemmas of sovereignty also hold important implications for power. Power, in turn, influences the repertoire of responses to dilemmas of sovereignty. I explore the reciprocal relationship between sovereignty compromises and power by zooming in and out of three different scenes of contemporary international relations: the ascent of China as a great power, variants of regionalism, and the evolving non-proliferation regime. These three realms are particularly suitable for a volume addressing Krasner’s contributions: they offer fruitful arenas for investigating two master variables in Krasner’s work; they have attracted considerable attention in the study and praxis of international relations, both of which have been weaved in his own work; and they address various levels of analysis -- domestic structures, rulers, states, entire regions, and international regimes -- relevant to his contributions.1 Scene 1 focuses on a single state, China’s shifting sovereignty compromises in tandem with its ascent to power. Scene 2 turns to the regional level to illuminate divergent sovereignty compromises in the Middle East and East Asia, with attendant consequences for aggregate regional power. Scene 3 explores how both vastly compromised sovereignty and power relations influenced the evolution of the international non-proliferation regime."
"July 19, 2010","One quarter of all interstate conflicts are multilateral, with the majority of these having a coalition of states fighting on at least one side. However, current theories of war outcome are dominated by dyadic explanations which ignore the contribution of coalitions. While popular opinion views coalitions as ineffective in waging war, these criticisms overlook many advantages to fighting as part of a coalition. While coalitions often do have problems, the strengths of fighting together outweigh the cost, making coalitions more likely to win wars. Empirical examination of war outcomes between 1816 and 1997 confirms this hypothesis; coalitions are almost three times more likely to win the wars they fight when compared to states fighting outside of a coalition. Further, as command and control becomes more centralized, allowing greater coordination between coalition members, the odds of victory greatly increase."
"July 19, 2010","The U.S is committed to supporting democracy in the Arab world during the Bush administration after the failure in the Iraqi war. This interest changed during Obama years who put Arab – Israeli conflict as priority for his administration. The U.S also has other agendas, most notably the security aspects of the so-called “war on terror”. When these agendas collide, however, the U.S’s democracy commitments are perceived to suffer. The author presents recommendations for an improved relationship between the U.S and the Arab world, with a focus on a long-term, flexible and credible support for democracy building, emphasizing the need not to let democracy and human rights objectives be subordinated to other agendas, not least because the different sets of objectives are mutually supportive."
"July 19, 2010","This paper asks whether US energy security can be improved through the adoption of two clean technologies that require resources in which the US is not abundant and will likely import.  It shows that energy interdependence can succeed in enhancing US energy security where policies of self-sufficiency have failed.  However, this largely depends on the nature of the energy resource being traded as well as who the US is procuring it from.  Interdependence doesn't necessarily bring about peace between two nations, particularly when energy is traded.  Thus, it's important for the US to diversify its types of fuel as well as its suppliers in order to minimize costs as well as its exposure to economic and geopolitical shocks in the global energy market.  The US can measure whether diversification is being done effectively through the total cost and total risk of its energy portfolio.  The two clean technologies examined, nuclear power and lithium-ion batteries for next-generation hybrid and electric cars, yield positive diversification effects on the US energy portfolio and enhance its energy security."
"July 19, 2010","This paper will engage a certain kind of self-corrective processes that mature, yet imperfectly just democracies sometimes undergo. The main aim will be to theorise the nature and functions of state apologies for past injustice as a particular kind of political act. My inquiry will be guided by two questions. First, how can we think of states as apologisers? Philosophers have theorised apology as inherently presupposing the experience of remorse and regret for the injustice committed. Since it would obviously be difficult to attribute emotional responses to states, I shall argue that we need to move beyond existing accounts of apology and offer a modified understanding of what it means when officials say ""sorry."" Second, what kind of functions can apologies serve? While not underestimating realists' emphasis on the strategic value of such state acts, I shall argue that official apologies can be understood as exemplary political judgments meant to provoke societal reflection on history and identity. As such, they are part of democratic efforts to closer and closer approximate guiding political principles in practice. Insights from the philosophy of judgment will be used to offer an account of the pedagogical and inspirational agenda public apologies can be brought to serve. By the end of the paper I hope to have argued that by rethinking public apologies as efforts to unsettle unjustly closed accounts we can have a better grasp of their catalytic role under non-ideal circumstances."
"July 19, 2010","Sacred time has shaped military effectiveness in modern conflicts, from the American Revolution, through both World Wars, the Vietnam War, and the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, to the ongoing insurgency in Iraq.  At times, initiators of conflict have timed their surprise attacks to coincide with significant dates in the religious calendars of their opponents in the hope of securing a tactical or strategic advantage.  At other times, holy days have influenced the ability or willingness of combatants to fight effectively.  I offer an investigation into the notion of sacred time, drawing on the sociology of religion, and examine the manner in which symbols and rituals associated with sacred time have influenced military responsiveness and skill.  I demonstrate statistical correlation between violence and sacred time in an empirical analysis of sectarian and insurgent attacks in contemporary Iraq.  I then examine testimonies from the 1973 Arab-Israeli War to show that Egyptian decision makers were mindful and explicit about the religious significance of Yom Kippur, the date on which they chose to launch their attack.  By exploring the pervasive effects of religious calendars on modern combat, I hope to redirect the focus of the study of religion and violence away from the narrow preoccupation with fundamentalism and terrorism and onto the much broader range of cases in which religion shapes secular conflict in multiple -- and often unexpected -- ways."
"July 19, 2010","I use original survey data from post-conflict Burundi to study transitional justice preferences during a democratic transition to peace after civil war.  I focus on preferences over punishing versus forgiving those who perpetrated human rights violations during war and pursuing a commonly accepted truth versus not doing so about such violations.  I accomplish three things in the paper.  First, I employ a specially-devised questioning method to minimize the potential for social desirability bias.  Using the method, I find that most Burundians take a rather moderate position on punishment and truth-seeking, somewhat contrary to the picture that one gets from the advocacy literature.   Second, I assess whether variation in support may be motivated by political concerns, insecurity, or lack of knowledge.  I find some support for all of these possibilities, although the evidence speaks most clearly in favor of the political motivations hypothesis. Finally, I use a deliberation experiment embedded in survey to study how responsive are people to attempts at persuading them to change their views.  I show that people are not very responsive to these efforts, and that if there is any reaction, it seems to be to that people become more resolved to maintain their position."
"July 19, 2010","Despite numerous studies explaining the onset of international mediation in conflicts, the literature offers surprisingly little insights into when we are likely to see “multi-party mediation,” i.e., mediation attempts that are conducted by a coalition of interveners. In order to address this shortcoming, the paper builds upon prior research on coalition formations and mediation, and examines the onset of multi-party mediation from a threefold perspective. First, there are demand-side influences. More specifically, the author argues that factors pertaining to the belligerents themselves such as the intensity of a dispute, the regime type of the warring parties, or their capabilities are likely to explain if disputes see multi-party mediation. Second, supply-side determinants, i.e., intervener incentives, have an impact on the likelihood of multi-party mediation. The research concentrates here on mediators’ economy, the accountability of their executive, and capabilities. Finally, the paper claims that ties between the antagonists and the mediator(s) are also likely to matter. Accordingly, this study measures the bias of the latter towards the former. Utilizing data from the Issues Correlates of War Project (ICOW) in 1950-2000, the theoretical model is empirically tested in a quantitative large-N research design. The results point to a disconnect between the factors that promote single-party mediation onset and those that promote multi-party mediations."
"July 18, 2010","This paper examines the relationship between rainfall, water, and socio-political unrest in Africa.  In particular, we are interested in how deviations from normal rainfall patterns, and extreme events such as flooding and drought, affect the propensity for individuals and groups to engage in disruptive activities such as demonstrations, riots, strikes, communal conflict, and anti-government violence.  In contrast to much of the environmental security literature, we use a much broader definition of conflict that includes, but is not is not limited to, organized rebellion.  Using a new database of over 6,000 instances of social conflict in the past 20 years - the Social Conflict in Africa Database (SCAD) - we examine the effect of deviations from normal rainfall patterns on various types of conflict.  Our results indicate that rainfall variability has a significant effect on both large-scale and smaller-scale instances of political conflict.  We find that rainfall is correlated with civil war and insurgency, although wetter years are more likely to suffer from violent events.  Extreme deviations in rainfall - particularly dry and wet years - are associated with all types of political conflict (violent and nonviolent, government-targeted and non/government-targeted), though the relationship is strongest with respect to violent events, which are more responsive to abundant rather than scarce rainfall.  By looking at a broader spectrum of social conflict, rather than limiting the analysis to civil war, we demonstrate a robust relationship between environmental shocks and violence."
"July 18, 2010","In Northern Uganda, a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony has been fighting the government since the mid-1980s in what has become Africa's longest civil war. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people have died in the civil war while others have had their lips, ears or limbs cut off and thousands of children have been abducted as fighters, laborers, and concubines. This violence, in turn, produced more than 1.8 million Internally Displaced Peoples Camps, throughout Northern Uganda. Many Northerners blame the Ugandan government for forcing them into inhumane camps and for failing to protect them from the marauding LRA."
"July 18, 2010","There is a common consensus about the argument that the events of September 11, 2001 changed the world completely. However, there is a wide disparity of views when it comes to initiations of the event, its analysis and the chain of consequences of this event."
"July 18, 2010","This paper questions the depiction of the liberal peace consensus as one constituted by a liberal-conservative, state-centric discourse and an emancipatory, socio-centric one. It contends that making a distinction between state-centrism and statism reveals a shared statist predisposition of conservative, liberal and emancipatory peacebuiding, while it sheds light on some aspects of the shift from peacebuilding to statebuilding. It also attributes emancipatory peacebuilding's “statist sociocentrism” to a Marxist-instrumentalist heritage, and caracterizes new critiques of liberal peace as proponents of either a post-liberal sociocentrism or a critical statecentrism."

"July 17, 2010","This paper uses a detailed database of political violence in Egypt to study European and US tourists' attitudes towards travelling to a conflict region. We use time series analysis to study the heterogeneous impacts of different dimensions of political violence and counter-violence on tourist flows to Egypt in the 1990s. We find that both US and EU tourists respond negatively to attacks on tourists, but do not appear to be influenced by casualties arising in confrontations between domestic groups. However, European tourists are sensitive to the counter-violence measures implemented by the Egyptian government. There is also evidence of tourism in Egypt being affected by the Israeli / Palestinian conflict, with arrivals of tourists into Egypt rising when fatalities in Israel increase."
"July 17, 2010","The recent government crackdown on opposition voices in Rwanda discussing the country’s 1994 genocide raises important questions about freedom of speech in a post-genocide society. Does a country have greater latitude to restrict speech in the aftermath of destabilizing conflict? Rwanda has enacted a controversial new law criminalized denying the genocide and inciting divisionism. Under that law, opposition leader Victoire Ingabire and American law professor Peter Erlinder were recently arrested for statements allegedly challenging the 1994 genocide. Their cases strike at the heart of the challenges post-conflict countries face balancing civil liberties and freedoms with establishing the rule of law and preventing a slide back into violence. Which considerations should it take into account in deciding whether and how to limit speech? How can a country struggling to establish the rule of law provide effective checks on the potential misuse of speech restrictions? This Article examines how Israel, Germany, and the United States have protected and limited speech and how their experiences could inform speech regulations in post-conflict societies. It argues for post-conflict countries taking a middle ground between Rwanda’s current overbroad genocide ideology law and the United State’s absolutist approach to address restrictions on speech."
"July 17, 2010","This chapter reviews current evidence of the impact of truth commissions on transitional and post-conflict society on several potential measures, including human rights and reconciliation among others. In many respects, the question of whether truth commissions do have a substantive impact and, if so, whether it is positive or negative, remains unanswered. The chapter then suggests that one reason for the rapid spread of truth commissions despite the uncertainty as to what they do is that a variety of international actors have become proponents of this form of transitional justice."

"July 17, 2010","In this paper we investigate the impact that judicial decisions relating to the recognition of aboriginal property rights have on long run resource industry and macroeconomic performance. We use four decisions handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada since 1973 to identify a range of economic consequences resulting from discontinuities in the formal, legal recognition of property rights. These consequences include the suppression of investment demand and supply incentives, reductions in resource industry profits, and reductions in real GDP per capita growth. To characterize the nature and importance of these effects we begin with a series of event studies which measure the impact that each court decision had on common share prices for firms engaged in the extraction and processing of Canada's forest resources. The share price effects reflect investors' perception of the decisions' impact on both the forestry firms' current access to resource stocks, and uncertainty surrounding the security of their property rights into the future. Stock access and uncertainty affect industry and macroeconomic performance in different ways. In the second stage of our investigation we use predictions drawn from finance theory and renewable resource theory to construct a partial equilibrium simulation model. With this model we quantify the impact that the stock access and uncertainty effects implied by the results of our event studies have on the forestry sector's economic fundamentals. In the third and final stage of our investigation we use the industry profit effects derived from the simulation model in a highly stylized general equilibrium model of the Canadian economy to estimate the impact that the Court's decisions had on real GDP per capita growth performance during the 1970-2005 period. Under certain circumstances the performance effects we measure can be substantial, but the cumulative impact varies widely depending on the combination of stock access and uncertainty implied by each of the Supreme Court decisions we study."

"July 17, 2010","Northeast India is beset with persisting assertions of ethnic nationalism against the Indian state.  Within the region there exist an intractable divide between the tribals, who mostly settle in the hill areas, and the non-tribal valley dwellers. Since the early days of the post-independence period there was a movement for the formation of the Eastern Hill State consisting of all the hill areas and the contiguous areas inhabited by people of the same racial stock in Assam. They emphasise their “difference from the plains people and blamed Assamese for trying to impose their culture and language on the hill-tribes and for attempts to dominate in legislature and services.”  These resulted in the ‘politics of negativism’ and the eventual demand for separate administrative units. The outcome of such policies was the eventual formation of the state of Meghalaya and Mizoram."

"July 16, 2010","We study ingroup bias -- the preferential treatment of members of one's group -- in naturally occurring data, where economically significant allocation decisions are made under a strong non-discriminatory norm. Data come from Israeli small claims courts during 2000-2004, where the assignment of a case to an Arab or Jewish judge is effectively random. We find robust evidence for judicial ingroup bias. Furthermore, this bias is strongly associated with terrorism intensity in the vicinity of the court in the year preceding the ruling. The results are consistent with theory and lab evidence according to which salience of group membership enhances social identification."
"July 15, 2010","Since there is no definition of “terrorism” upon which all the world nations agree, this article proposes to approach the phenomenon on the basis of normative concepts widely recognized by social scientists. We think the issue would be more manageable if we use terms like “deviance” and “dissent” to describe terrorism to those people who are suffering from its consequences (Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine, etc…), without alienating them: that would move the problem from the field of fear and passivity quite anchored in the minds, to put the stress more on the politically and morally unsocial behavior. On the level of the media and the public diplomacy, this approach may reveal to be rewarding, over time."
"July 15, 2010","If the government following the elections of March 7, 2010, reveals to be unable to appease the tensions, by maintaining a minimum level of security, the risk of a greater eruption of violence may increase, with the prospect of the US troops leaving the country. The state that the Bush administration took out from Saddam’s hands risks falling for an indefinite time in endless conflicts. Not only is there the danger of becoming a failed state, but the neighborhood will also be affected. In this paper we try to assess the results of seven years of occupation, and the problems that may arise following the withdrawal of U.S. troops."
"July 15, 2010","Since September 2000, as a result of mobility restrictions, the supply of Palestinian workers competing for local jobs in the West Bank has increased by about fifty percent. This paper takes advantage of this unique natural experiment to study the effects of labor supply shocks on labor market outcomes. Using quarterly information on wages and employment in each city in the West Bank, the paper analyzes the short-run adjustment of labor markets to a large inflow of workers separately from the effects of political instability. The results suggest that low-skilled wages are adversely affected by an increase in the supply of low- and high-skilled workers, while high-skilled wages are only weakly negatively related to an increase in their own supply. This is consistent with a scenario in which high skilled workers compete for low skilled jobs, pushing the low skilled into unemployment. This latter hypothesis is confirmed by analyzing the effects of changes in labor supply on unemployment."
"July 15, 2010","This paper considers the various legal issues that would arise in the context of Quebec's secession from Canada, and attempts to situate these issues politically. The author argues that, under the current constitutional amending formula, Quebec secession would require the support of the federal Parliament as well as the unanimous consent of the provinces; he also suggests that it is extremely unlikely that this level of support would be attained. The paper goes on to explore the possibility of Quebec seceding from Canada through a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), suggesting that the success or failure of a UDI would depend upon the ability of Quebec to exercise effective and exclusive control over its own territory and population. The author also argues that a Quebec UDI would almost certainly be contested by Canada, thus precipitating a costly contest for legal supremacy between the Canadian and Quebec governments. The legal, economic, and political uncertainty associated with two rival regimes would impose enormous costs on everyone involved, leading to author to conclude that a Quebec UDI is a legal possibility, but quite impractical and unacceptable in pragmatic political terms. The final section of the paper considers the implications of the recent proposals for joint political institutions between a sovereign Quebec and Canada, claiming that joint political institutions are unlikely to be created following sovereignty."
"July 15, 2010","Volume I. “Elites and Concepts” examines the action and the doctrines of several US administrations in the Middle East, in order to pinpoint what went wrong in the relationships between them and the region. It shows how this regional subsystem is made in such a way that it constantly appears to seek sponsorship from an outside power. Analyzing the Bush Doctrine, this volume questions the absence of any sign linking the Doctrine to economical and financial motivations and to political and electoral issues, providing a comprehensive answer as to the public and real agendas. This study explains how Bush's vision of the Middle East is identifiable to his network and not to be separated from the “laissez faire, laissez passez” ideology of the conservative right and its “moral bricolage”; in so doing, it gives an exhaustive account of the conservative and neo-conservative landscape and ideology, with a focus on the Middle East, along with a complete “Who's Who” of its leaders and organizations. The ideological connections between US and Israeli and Arab and Muslim conservatives are also scrutinized and compared, including think tanks, values system, corporative and political actors, attitudes and positions in the US and the Middle East, and similarities of approaches and recurrences, in order to reveal the sources of the influences exerted on Middle East foreign policy and the decision-making process."
"July 15, 2010","“The effect of great and sudden wealth on the tiny desert states of the (…) Gulf has been remarkable"", says P. Mansfield. In the kingdom of Saudi Arabia it has produced one of the most extraordinary phenomena of the twentieth century. It is not only that a state which was one of poorest on the globe when it was created half a century ago is well on its way to becoming one of the richest by any standards, with control over a major part of the world‘s financial reserves, but that it should have happened to a Bedouin tribal monarchy ruled on the most fundamentalist and puritanical principles of Islam. The inescapable problem of how to serve both Allah and Mammon has yet to be resolved."" Maybe never as since 9/11 this problem has been raised in more an urgency, both to Americans and Saudis, because – particularly, of all the connections between funds and fundamentalist terror, of all the ambiguities and misunderstandings, of the stereotypes, the pre-conceptions, and the false dialogue, the hypocrisy internationally established."
"July 15, 2010","This paper analyzes the distributive impacts of violent conflicts, which is in contrast to previous literature that has focused on the other direction. We use cross-country panel data for the time period 1960-2005 to estimate war-related changes in income inequality. Our results indicate rising levels of inequality during war and especially in the early period of post-war reconstruction. However, we find that this rise in income inequality is not permanent. While inequality peaks around five years after the end of a conflict, it declines again to pre-war levels within the end of the first post-war period. Lagged effects of conflict and only subsequent adjustments of redistributive policies in the period of post-war reconstruction seem to be valid explanations for these patterns of inequality. A series of alternative specifications confirms the main findings of the analysis."

"July 13, 2010","Three interrelated ambiguities in the relations between Somalia, the United Nations, and the United States directly precipitated the collapse of the U.N. mission in Somalia. First, armed U.N. intervention in a failed state presented complex issues regarding the relation between Somalia and the United Nations, functional distinctions between international armed conflict and non-international armed conflict, and the applicability of international humanitarian law to U.N. military forces and belligerents in a failed state. Second, the Security Council’s approval of humanitarian intervention in Somalia provided U.N. forces with a conflicting mandate: to establish a “caretaker” government, effectively overriding Somalia’s sovereignty, while also conducting a “peacekeeping” operation that deferred to the sovereign will of Somalia’s internal, domestic peace process. Finally, limited rules of engagement hampered UNOSOM missions that ostensibly acted under a banner of U.N. neutrality while they attempted to enforce a Security Council-issued “warrant” for the arrest of Aideed."
"July 11, 2010","The paper studies the principal aspects of China’s defense strategy in the post-Cold War era, presenting an overview of the Sino-Russian defense cooperation. Focus is placed on the evolution of the operational/tactical doctrine of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA); PLA’s plans for the development of regional power-projection capabilities; the role of the United States of America and Japan as critical independent variables, influencing China’s foreign and defense policies; China’s threat perceptions in the 21st century; the centrality of the Taiwan issue in the Chinese defense planning; as well as, the development of “sea denial” and anti-aircraft carrier capabilities by the PLA Navy. We are also going to present a concise analysis of the influence exercised on the current Chinese defense and geopolitical planning by F. Ratzel’s concept of “living space”, and A.T. Mahan’s theory on the importance of naval power. Finally, our intention is to try to portray the bilateral Sino-Russian defense cooperation (developed after Soviet Union’s dissolution) as an important dimension of the Chinese national defense strategy in the post-Cold War era. We will attempt at presenting the main dilemmas and challenges posed by this relationship and define the main factors that will determine the future prospects of the Sino-Russian defense cooperation. Particular focus is placed on arms transfers and military-technical cooperation between the two states. In the final part of our monograph are cited three analytical tables depicting all the major contracts providing for arms transfers, concluded between the PRC and the Russian Federation between the years 1992 and 2009, and their implications on the regional security."
"July 11, 2010","The last few years have seen a rise in challenges to arbitrators. It is argued that challenges are a tactic resorted to by parties and their counsel to cause delay and increase the costs of arbitration and, thus, undermine the parties’ choice and the finality of awards. However, the right to challenge an arbitrator and the arbitrators’ duty of disclosure are key to ensuring the integrity of the arbitral process. This article examines how the balance is struck between these two objectives by looking at the nature and the scope of the right to challenge arbitrators and the duty to disclose under national laws and rules of arbitral institutions. After reviewing recent national court cases and arbitral decisions concerning challenge, the article calls for (i) the threshold for challenging arbitrators in investment arbitrations to be, at the very least, the same as in international commercial arbitrations; (ii) a neutral and independent body to be given the authority to review challenges under the ICSID system; and (ii) disclosure obligations to be imposed on counsel and the parties."
"July 11, 2010","This paper argues that the use of the Security Council to develop feminist and women’s activism on women, peace and security splits between resolutions (1325 and 1889) that seek to build women’s agency and resolutions (1820 and 1888) that focus on combating sexual violence against women in conflict and post-conflict environments. The consequence is a limiting of agency, for some women, to situations where women have been sexually violated. Furthermore, a split between first world feminist actors, who gain agency as gender experts, and third world women, who are present as harmed or requiring protection within the resolutions, reflects larger tensions in Western and global feminisms. The paper further argues that the use of military force to challenge widespread or systematic sexual violence requires feminist debate rather than unquestioned inclusion in Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security."
"July 11, 2010","An in-depth examination of Irish nationalist and Ulster unionist politics during the Northern Ireland conflict. Based on newly released archival material, Cillian McGrattan addresses the crucial question as to how the choices of political actors influenced the emergence and persistence of the 'Troubles.' As such, he provides a fundamental reappraisal of the role of the British and Irish states and the main political parties during the conflict. The Northern Ireland case study provides a lens through which he engages with wider academic debates regarding ethno-nationalist conflicts and settlement processes. The book breaks new ground in asking how path-dependency theory illuminates a troublesome nationalist arena, how policymaking contributes to long-term polarisation and entrenchment, and what these historical legacies mean for how once-violent societies deal with their past and tackle their transitions to peace."
"July 10, 2010","This article critically assesses the application of the ‘transitional justice’ model of conflict ransformation in Northern Ireland. The model addresses a number of important issues for societies emerging from violent conflict, including victims’ rights and dealing with the past. This article claims that the model is founded upon highly contentious political assumptions that give rise to a problematic framing of the issues involved. The underlying implication is that by eschewing basic political analysis in favour of unexamined ideals concerning conflict transformation, the TJ approach belies its commitment to truth recovery, victims’ rights and democratic accountability."
"July 09, 2010","An abundance of valuable natural resources, such as oil, timber, gold, or diamonds, in a country has in recent years increasingly proven to be a cause for socio-economic and political instability rather than an engine for development. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the ‘resource curse’. In several cases, a wealth of valuable natural resources in a country has even triggered or fueled armed conflict. Examples include the ‘blood diamonds’ of Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the ‘conflict timber’ of Liberia and Cambodia. Natural resources are among the principal means to finance internal armed conflicts today, sometimes replacing external funding by foreign states. Furthermore, internal rivalry for access to, and control over, the exploitation of valuable natural resources occasionally spills over to neighbouring countries, thus internationalizing an internal armed conflict. The plundering of natural resources in the DRC by Uganda, Burundi, and Rwanda, respectively, may serve as an example. In these instances, access to natural resources may even have become the principal reason for the parties to continue fighting in armed conflict. Since the global demand for scarce natural resources will only increase in the decades to come, armed conflicts over these natural resources are likely to occur more often or, as Michael Klare puts it, ‘resource wars will become, in the years ahead, the most distinctive feature of the global security environment.’ This new reality poses important challenges to contemporary international law relating to the management of natural wealth and resources during armed conflict."
"July 09, 2010","How effective are peacekeeping operations in the prevention and stopping violence? Is there an alternative to militarized and multidimensional peacekeeping? Would totally civilian unarmed peace operation be the best alternative? These and many more questions feed the ongoing debate on peace operations and the possibility of some civilian alternatives to the current peace operations. This article is not a case for or against civilian peacekeeping, but rather an analysis of the developing theory on civilian peacekeeping, its relevance in the field of Conflict Resolution and its autonomy from the multidimensional peacekeeping championed by the UN and regional organizations. Written by a scholar of Peace and Conflict Research and having acquired practical experience both from UNPKOs and “civilian peacekeeping” missions, it gives practical and theoretical insights on peacekeeping, whether traditional, multidimensional or civilian."
"July 06, 2010","While rejecting the leitmotiv of effectiveness versus ineffectiveness and the balance sheets weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the OSCE in relation to other organizations, this article undertakes a ‘pre-effectiveness’ analysis of the OSCE in the European security environment. Not performance, but organizational goal and structure are the foci of the chapter, since these and their intrinsic relationship shape the effectiveness of the OSCE. While placing a central importance on the distinction between hard and soft security, the OSCE’s goal and structure – the latter understood as culture, practice and material resources – are carved out by analyzing the founding and early functioning of the CSCE, the conceptual design of today’s OSCE and the CSCE/OSCE involvement in violent conflicts in South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia during the period 1990-2005. In the view of this analysis, options for reform are discussed, in particular the model of (minor) structural reform, currently adopted by the OSCE, and the reform of the goal as the means of legitimizing bidirectional outsourcing."
"July 05, 2010","This paper aims to present a rational decision model applied to studies of private military security companies. These organizations complement the actions of the armed forces or (in some countries) take their place, they are fulfilling a delicate role on emerging democracies. Situations are illustrated in the case of Colombia."
"July 05, 2010","In the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act (‘SADA’) of 2007, Congress authorized state governments to divest from businesses investing in Sudan. Congress took this unprecedented step in the face of objections from the Bush Administration and the business community that state divestment intrudes unconstitutionally into the exclusive foreign-relations prerogatives of the federal government. SADA would be remarkable enough if it allowed state divestment while adhering to a dualist conception of federalism. This paper explores the possibility that SADA and its progeny – the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (‘CISADA’) of 2010 – may signal the emergence of a dialogic view of federalism, under which the federal government recognizes that states may legitimately speak on international concerns within bounds that preserve ultimate federal control over foreign relations."
"July 05, 2010","Treason is an ancient crime, but it fell into disuse in most Western democratic states after World War II. Now it is making a comeback with prosecutions or threatened prosecutions against a new type of enemy - accused terrorists - in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel. In the postwar period, commentators wrongly argued that treason would no longer be prosecuted because it is anti-liberal, too difficult to prove, unnecessary because modern democracies are stable and secure, and premised on an extinct sense of loyalty to the state. This Article begins by debunking these claims and explaining treason’s recent reappearance. First, democratic states have altered their treason laws, without explicit amendment, to make them akin to other criminal laws. Second, technology has made treason both easier to detect and easier to prove. Third, although the states discussed in this Article are generally stable and secure, states are likely to employ treason prosecutions when they perceive an existential threat (even if one does not actually exist). Finally, the betrayal inherent in treason retains both its power to injure and its power to offend, giving treason as much indignant punch as it has ever had. Treason’s return is thus explainable, but is it a cause for concern? Treason prosecutions may have several potential benefits including reinforcing societal identity and unity, deterring future treason's, providing retribution against the traitor, and clarifying the procedural system under which terrorism should be addressed. But they may also pose dangers, including unduly aggrandizing the threat from terrorism, signaling weakness of the government that chooses to prosecute treason, biasing the criminal case against the defendant, and posing a difficult question about whether treason necessarily deserves the death penalty. Based on a weighing of these factors, this Article concludes by arguing that treason prosecutions are not cause for concern when they are confined to instances in which - like the U.S., British, and Israeli cases discussed in this Article - the threat posed by the terrorist group the traitor supports is akin to that posed by an enemy state."
"July 04, 2010","By examining the background and trends in cyber-crimes, and detailing what is presently known about terrorist uses of information technologies and the Internet, a surprising picture emerges: terrorists use information technologies but, at least for now, not as weapons. Nonetheless, the incessant drive to connect myriad aspects of our increasingly digital lives and infrastructures has, as a by-product of perceived and real efficiencies, created new vulnerabilities that allow for enterprising actors to potentially wreak havoc on a wide scale. The costs of ignoring such new vulnerabilities could be quite high."
"July 02, 2010","In 2006, Afghanistan remains a country in turmoil. It has a newly elected democratic government, a rebounding economy, and considerable economic potential. But the country is still torn by rival factions and dominated by the opium trade. Explores how Afghanistan has been rebuilt since the U.S. invasion of 2001, and what it means to create a modern state. Can state institutions be imposed from the outside? And what are the prospects for democracy in such a perilous place?"
"July 02, 2010","This article – a chapter in a collective volume on compliance and the role of non-binding norms in the international legal system – raises questions regarding the usefulness of the concepts of compliance and “soft law”,  each of which underlies a number of the contributions appearing elsewhere in the collective volume.  In particular, the author suggests that:  (1) approaching issues of the international normative order from the perspective of “compliance” risks obscuring or distorting an understanding of how international norms actually help to structure international order and cooperation; (2) the idea of “compliance with international soft law” may blur and impair the very useful distinction that states traditionally have drawn between legally binding and non-legally binding normative techniques in constructing their normative arrangements; (3) in studies of the international normative order, our primary emphasis and objective should be helping nations cooperate rather than simply “making them behave.”"
"June 30, 2010","This short essay, published as part of the proceedings of the 104th Annual Meeting of the American Society of International Law, confronts the problem of fragmentation in international law.  Based on a longer paper, it challenges not only fragmentation’s conventional treatment as a technical or doctrinal problem but the very notion that there is a single international law community with a single doctrine of sources.  On the contrary, the paper argues, what the problem of fragmentation reveals is that a single international law community is being replaced by separate, overlapping legal communities with significantly different views on law and legitimacy."
"June 29, 2010","Repeated calls to criminologists to engage in the analysis of violent political conflict have been followed by an abundant production of literature within the discipline. This article examines such production and attempts to delineate the limits to criminology in the analysis of political violence. By presenting interview extracts from a case study centred on violent political conflict in Italy during the 1970s and 1980s, I demonstrate why criminology should seek supplementary explanatory categories within the broader realm of social theory, rather than rely exclusively on the theories and assumptions of traditional criminology."
"June 29, 2010","The history of international efforts to control the flow of funds to designated ‘terrorist groups’ via the formal financial system is examined. The work shows that-despite the high motivation of some governments and international banks to reduce terrorist attacks, which harm their citizens, customers, staff and profits-it remains difficult to determine how this private-public policing interface can rationally target ‘risky capital’. Financial intelligence efforts have had little externally discernible impact on reducing levels of terrorism or on criminal convictions. It reviews evaluation problems in knowing whether the apparent lack of effects is due to measurement failure (estimating how much terrorist harm might have occurred had the controls not been imposed), theory failure or implementation failure. It argues for a more modest assessment of the likely impact of measures against financing terrorism and nuclear proliferation."
"June 29, 2010","Despite growing international concern about terrorism, until recently, very little was known about worldwide risk patterns for terrorist attacks. In this paper, we are especially interested in determining the extent to which terrorism is concentrated at the country level over time and whether different measures of terrorism (total, attributed and fatal attacks) yield similar results. Traditional sources of crime data-official police records and victimization and self-report crime surveys-typically exclude terrorism. In response, there has been growing interest in terrorist event databases. In this research, we report on the most comprehensive of these databases to date, formed by merging the Global Terrorism Database maintained by the START Center with the RAND-MIPT database. We use a statistical method called semi-parametric group-based trajectory analysis to examine 73,961 attacks in 206 countries and territories from 1970 to 2006. Our results confirm that terrorist attacks, like more common crimes, are highly concentrated across specific countries and these concentrations are fairly stable over time. Ten countries account for 38 per cent of all terrorist attacks in our data since 1970; 32 countries account for more than three-quarters of all attacks. The trajectory analysis also reveals a rapidly rising new terrorist threat concentrated especially among countries in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa."
"June 29, 2010","This article compares the background, motivation, pathways and prison experiences of Arab/Palestinian women who were imprisoned for conventional crimes with those who were incarcerated for security-related or terrorism offences. In-depth interviews of the two groups were conducted in the Israeli prisons in which they served their sentences. Prison personnel were also interviewed and court and prison files examined to validate the women's background and criminal history. Although both groups transgressed gender expectations by venturing into male-dominated worlds (crime and terrorism), the data point to differences between the groups regarding their personal background and the manner in which their violations were influenced by gender and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The implications of the findings for differences between crime and terrorism as related to gender and Palestinian terrorism are discussed."

"June 28, 2010","The author explores linkages between the transnational activities of a Canadian oil company operating in Sudan and the human rights and humanitarian violations committed by the Government of Sudan against the people of Southern Sudan in the course of the ongoing civil war.   The specific impact of the armed conflict on women is recounted in microcosm through a meeting between the author, a member of a fact finding mission to Sudan, and a group of Nuer women.  The encounter also provides an opportunity to query and theorize strategies deployed within a context of profound asymmetries of power. These discursive appeals are designed to generate both solidarity and accountability among women for the violation of fundamental human rights.  The author warns against attributing fixed and invariant meanings to particular tropes (such as sisterhood), and argues instead for an evaluation that takes into account the specific context within which discourses are deployed, including the position and agency of the speaker in relation to the listener."
"June 27, 2010","This Article concerns the application of the law of war to large-scale hostilities between an occupant and guerrilla forces. The Article makes two claims that distinguish it from existing literature. First, it demonstrates that the rationales most often invoked as bases for applying the law of war are unavailable in the context of large-scale hostilities between an occupant and guerrilla forces. The Article then proceeds to develop an alternative rationale for applying the law of war to such hostilities. This rationale concerns the interest of individual soldiers in ensuring that the scope of application of the law of war fully coincides with the moral reality of war. Relying on the said rationale as the main basis for applying the law of war entails strict limitations on the law of war’s field of application. The purview of the law of war in the context of hostilities between an occupant and guerrilla forces is thus very narrow. Secondly, this Article argues that the law of war governs within its field of application in an unqualified manner. The status of the law of war as lex specialis taking precedent over the norms of international human rights law extends to conflicts between a state and a non-state actor. The Article thus takes issue with the approach that advocates the adoption of a normative middle ground between the law of war and international human rights law."
"June 26, 2010","The September 11, 2001 attacks, while targeted toward the United States, had a global impact unmeasured by any event in recent history. The attacks resulted in two major armed conflicts with regimes on the other side of the world. The detention of foreign nationals in Guantanamo and in some domestic jails has raised interesting and serious legal questions about the rules of war, immigration policy and the balance between national security and civil rights."
"June 26, 2010","Despite the central role the media play in the domestic and foreign policy making processes, very little research examines the influence of international factors on media openness. This study investigates the impact of coercive diplomacy – in the form of economic sanctions – on press freedom. It is argued that foreign economic coercion will likely deteriorate press freedom by (1) restricting a sanctioned country’s interactions with the outside world thereby allowing the target regime to have greater control over the free flows of information; and (2) inflicting significant economic damage on the sustainability and development of independent media outlets. Using time-series, cross-national empirical data over a large number of countries for the period 1980-2000, the findings confirm economic sanctions’ negative effect on media openness. Extensive sanctions, in particular, have a greater negative impact on press freedom than more selective sanctions. Furthermore, multilateral sanctions will likely have a greater corrosive impact on media openness than unilateral sanctions."
"June 24, 2010","Historical discourse has become an important aspect of post-Suharto Indonesian politics. The nationalist instrumentalization of the past, always strong in Indonesia, took on a martial aspect under the New Order. Even today, the establishment remains reluctant to abandon it. But new visions of history have arisen out of the widespread protests against the New Order. Some preserve the form of a martial nationalist historiography, but displace it to the regions (especially Aceh and Papua), thus turning it against Jakarta. Others, both at a national and a local level, embrace more societal historiographies in which the state and national unity are not idealized, and in which internal conflict is not taboo."
"June 23, 2010","The paper deals with arbitration of unresolved issues in mutual agreement cases as regulated by the new paragraph 5, Article 25 of the OECD Model Convention to avoid double taxation in respect to income taxes. After general introductory remarks on the arbitration method in international tax matters, the paper describes the evolution of  international tax  arbitration. The central part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the procedure of the tax arbitration established by new  Article 25(5) of the OECD Model Convention, which has the features of a a multi-tiered dispute resolution clause. The paper concludes with a discussion on the effectiveness of the tax treaty arbitration of Article 25(5) OECD Model Convention."
"June 22, 2010","Amidst a heated political and diplomatic fray over the detention of some 600 persons at the U.S. Naval base of Guantanamo, Cuba, the U.S. Supreme Court announced on June 28, 2004 four cases involving the right of habeas corpus review for detainees dubbed “enemy combatants” held at Guantanamo Bay and in the United States. More broadly, the judgments enter a historically important line of cases involving protection against arbitrary detention in war time. Two consolidated cases, Rasul v. Bush and Al Odah v. United States answer the question whether U.S. federal courts can hear statutory habeas challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay."
"June 22, 2010","During the last three decades, due to widespread conflicts and wars, many people in Afghanistan have become internally displaced refugees or international immigrants. However, one commonality is that Afghans living locally and internationally have all been exposed to the traditional cultural norms of Afghanistan. As such, their task and relationship styles might be very similar. To explore the orientation of Afghans, this paper focuses on the differences of 106 local and 219 expatriate Afghans. Both groups of Afghans have significantly higher scores on the relationship orientation. These results can be helpful in the management training of employees working with local and multinational firms. Realities of the conflicts that Afghan people face are discussed and suggestions are presented."
"June 22, 2010","The Southern Philippines provides an interesting example of how violence contributes to the development and maintenance of identity in a self-sustaining conflict cycle. It reflects a conflict whose complexity has been reduced simplistically to one of a Muslim minority in contest with the state. An intervention based on superficial analysis may however not simply fail to resolve the conflict and end the violence, but fuel new conflicts. This paper proposes a disaggregation of the levels of conflict and the design of interventions appropriate to each to raise prospects of success. Particular attention is given the role of civil society and NGO’s in peace processes."
"June 22, 2010","The February 19th, 2010 release of a memorandum by the Justice Department clearing former Bush Administration lawyers John Yoo and Jay Bybee of any professional misconduct for their roles in authoring the so-called torture memos may have closed the chapter on the case against Bush Administration lawyers for formal sanctions from the United States government. But the debate about the propriety of the lawyers’ actions and the proper repercussions for them is far from over. The DOJ memorandum has renewed debate in the press and the academy about the now-hypothetical just deserts for the two men, even while Spanish authorities continue to pursue formal international criminal investigations against them."
"June 22, 2010","This article explains the origins of the United Nations’ global counter-terrorism system. We argue that three factors shaped the system’s decentralized and state-centered characteristics. The first is the UN’s reactions to terrorism prior to the attacks of 11 September 2001. The second factor is the growing relevance of transnational governance networks. The third force is the interests and concerns of the Security Council’s permanent representatives, which ultimately shaped the system’s architecture."
"June 22, 2010","Having established that massive human rights violations in armed conflict constitute a threat to the peace and that women are the most severely affected by the scourge of war, the Security Council has since 1999 adopted a number of resolutions intended specifically for this group. These instruments contribute to the development of humanitarian law applicable to women and acknowledge the value of active participation by women in peace efforts. The following article first analyses the foundations on which the Council has been able to assume responsibility for protecting women in situations of armed conflict, and then considers the actual protection it provides. It concludes that the Council has had varying success in this role, pointing out that the thematic and declaratory resolutions on which it is largely based are not binding and therefore, they are relatively effective only as regards their provisions committing United Nations bodies. The author proposes that the Council’s role could be better accomplished through situational resolutions than through resolutions declaratory of international law."
"June 21, 2010","A bill of rights that is entrenched and supreme over legislative and executive action, backed up by judicial review by independent courts, is now what we associate with a “normal” state, and the onus of justification has shifted on those wishing to omit these arrangements from any new constitution. In the post-conflict state, the adoption of constitutions that entrench civil and political rights has become part of the standard script of peacebuilding, along with the development of competitive politics and open markets."
"June 21, 2010","News is defined and explicated with respect to the principles of stewardship, in turn defined and explicated with reference to the journalistic profession and CNN in particular.  The stress is less upon the ‘need to know’ or even the ‘right to know’ but rather upon what is worthy as valid journalistic content.  The argument is advanced that, as a profession, journalists occupy an office that requires stewardship, a canopy term encompassing all aspects of ethics touching upon the obligations of and to offices."
"June 21, 2010","This article revisits the use of force discourse that was invoked by states, international organisations, and individuals, in response to Israel’s military assault on the Gaza Strip in Operation Cast Lead.  In particular, it examines the legal issues raised in a letter published by two dozen international lawyers in The Sunday Times (of London) on January 11, 2009, characterising the assault as an act of aggression.  The author argues that the key issue in making this determination would seem to be the legal status of the Gaza Strip.  This is because if Gaza is still considered occupied territory, then the situation is one of belligerent occupation and the question of aggression would not normally arise.  However, there have been examples of state practice where non-state entities entitled to self-determination have been subjected to acts of aggression in the past.  In those cases it was the gravity of the military offensive that was the determining factor.  Seen in this light, and taking the United Nation’s 1974 Definition of Aggression as a guiding document, it could be argued that the Gaza Strip was subjected to an act of aggression in Operation Cast Lead."
"June 20, 2010","Solomon Islands has the dubious distinction of being the first in the Pacific to be labelled a failed state.  The circumstances that have led to this situation both contribute to and emerge from a range of factors that also have significant influence for the issue of human trafficking in the country.  This paper presents a local research organisation’s perspective on the nature of knowledge about trafficking in the Solomons, and examines the factors in the country that mediate both knowledge about trafficking and the phenomenon itself."
"June 19, 2010","Killer drones are the future of warfare.  Their use, viewed from one angle, generates few legal problems insofar as drones merely provide another tool for the longstanding military practice of killing enemies from the air.  Yet, since the drone’s extraordinary capabilities have greatly expanded the government’s range for finding, tracking, and killing human targets in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other places, commentators debate whether it is legal to kill suspected terrorists in self-defense or as part of an armed conflict - or whether America’s targeted killing is murder."
"June 19, 2010","I develop a dynamic model of social conflict whereby manifest grievances of the poor generate the incentive of taking over political power violently. Rebellion can be an equilibrium outcome depending on the level of preexisting inequality between the poor and the ruling elite, the relative military capabilities of the two groups and the destructiveness of conflict. Once a technology of repression is introduced, widespread fear reduces the parameter space for which rebellion is an equilibrium outcome. However, I show that repression-driven peace comes at a cost as it produces a welfare loss to society."
"June 19, 2010","Muslim fundamentalist movements pose major challenges to international law. Yet, the field of international law has failed to offer a significant response. Seeking to provide simple counter-narratives to the admittedly problematic narratives of some governments in the context of the ""war on terror"", international lawyers have often omitted discussion of Muslim fundamentalism altogether. While Edward Said's notion of Orientalism may manifest in stereotypical approaches to fundamentalism, it may also surface in the refusal to address the question at all because it is deemed to be embedded in Muslim culture."
"June 18, 2010","Israel's extensive use of the Cluster Munitions in the 2006 Lebanon War provided a major impetus for drafting the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). Israel, blamed for severe humanitarian post-conflict harm to civilians in South Lebanon, simultaneously faced an extensive diplomatic entanglement with the U.S. based on suspicions that Israel had violated U.S. legislation as well as a classified bilateral end-use agreement specifying the conditions of use of U.S.-made CMs. Relying on numerous sources, especially the recent declassified (June 2008) IDF's Military Advocate General's legal opinion into whether Israel's CM use complied with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the 2008 Israel's Inquiry Commission into the 2006 War final report, this Article lists seven intriguing lessons learned from that War regarding the legality of CM under IHL. These lessons also highlight the fundamental differences in the approaches taken by CCM supporters vis-á-vis the U.S. and other major CM stockpilers, which hold that restricting and regulating the use of CMs (through adopting a new Protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons) is sufficient to avoid future harm to civilians from these weapons. Beyond the legality issue, this Article draws conclusions to the Protocol's fragility and, importantly, to the CCM's necessity"
"June 16, 2010","Double Taxation Treaties (DTTs) are bilateral contracts with the primary goal of fostering the movement of capital and people between the two contracting states by eliminating double taxation. However, even though recent research suggests that such a treaty in fact increases bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI), entering such a tax treaty is not unambiguously favourable for both partners if their bilateral FDI positions are asymmetric. Due to the usual bias towards residence-based taxation in DTTs, net-capital importers can face a considerable loss of tax revenues when entering these treaties. Nevertheless, there is an ever denser and growing global network of such treaties. This article argues that net-capital importing countries are caught in a prisoners’ dilemma: collectively, they would be better off refusing to sign DTTs, but each one has an incentive to sign DTTs to gain a competitive advantage. Countries will look toward and be influenced by the policy choices of other focal countries and will follow their DTT activity. We find evidence for such spatial dependence in our analysis of DTT diffusion in a global sample over the period 1959 to 2007. Dyads are more likely to conclude a DTT the more DTTs have previously been concluded by the regional peers of the dyad members as well as by other countries who compete with one of the dyad members in terms of export product structure."
"June 14, 2010","Contemporary defenders of ""nation-building"" draw a sharp distinction between the ""new"" and ""old"" versions of that political practice. The old nation-building, in which a foreign power would design the institutional and legal architecture of another political community without its consent, is widely viewed as an imperialist enterprise motivated by a mixture of self-interest and patronizing nobless oblige, which paid lip-service to the right of self-determination. The new nation-building, as propounded by Noah Feldman, Michael Ignatieff, and Simon Chesterman, aims to further liberal democracy rather than undermine it, and structures the obligations of the occupying (not imperial) power such that they must take the right to self-determination seriously. However, a fundamental conceptual challenge to this view of the new nation-building may undermine its sharp distinction between new and old: the new version presupposes that who the people are who possess the right to self-determination and wish to exercise it is an uncontroversial question. Using case studies from Iraq, Sri Lanka, Yugoslavia, and Canada, the author argues that certain old imperial dilemmas inhere in the very project of nation-building, because even the procedural task of establishing durable democratic institutions presupposes a substantive judgement regarding what the boundaries of the relevant political community are. This task proves problematic in multinational states such as those considered by the author."

Consider three places in which the United States and a number of European nations have taken an active military role while trying to assist nascent or renascent judicial systems: Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Not only is day-to-day life dangerous and the Rule of Law tenuous, judges are physically at risk because of their role while corruption threatens their integrity."

"June 12, 2010","Federalism has long been a topic of study for comparative constitutional law. However, the scholarly literature on federalism is in a process of transition. For most of the twentieth century, the study of federalism was oriented around a standard set of cases in the developed world: Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United States of America. These cases provided the raw material for certain fundamental questions: What is federalism? Why should federations be adopted? What role is there for courts? For the most part, these questions appear to have been answered, often with the aid of comparative analysis. To be sure, important debates persist. For example, scholars disagree over the relative priority to be given to the different goals served by federalism and how those goals should shape the allocation of jurisdiction. In the area of environmental policy, for example, new opportunities for democratic self-government and policy experimentation argue for greater regional authority but also generate inter-jurisdictional externalities, which argue against it. This debate relies on an implicit understanding of its terms and range, and participants in such discussions of federalism often draw on the same standard set of jurisdictions as illustrations of models to be followed and dangers to be avoided."
"June 12, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the insights that might be generated into the nature of ‘lone wolf terrorism’ through the application of economic analysis. Orthodox approaches, particularly (standard) expected utility analysis and game theoretical analysis, are discussed. These tools prove useful in developing preliminary or ‘first order’ insights. The lone wolf terrorist exhibits a number of idiosyncrasies that present challenges to both economic analysis and government security policy. An alternative analytical framework is constructed wherein a terroristic agent makes choices on the basis of a preference ordering constructed over two moments of the distribution (measured in terms of fatalities generated by terrorist attacks). Seven predictions are yielded from the mean-variance theoretical framework and numerical estimates are computed as preliminary steps towards the full exploration of the implications of the framework. Most importantly, depending on their level of risk aversion (or risk seeking behaviour), lone wolves are expected to predominantly choose assassination, armed attack, bombing, hostage taking or unconventional attacks. Furthermore, within a range of between one and two standard deviations from the mean, it is possible that the quadratic utility function will reach a maximum. Following attacks of a certain magnitude (in terms of fatalities), it might be expected that the lone wolf will withdraw from activity for a period of time. This analytical approach may assist governments and security agencies facing the threat of lone wolf terrorism."

"June 11, 2010","The new Penal Code Bill in Chile initiated a public and parliamentary debate regarding which social conflicts should be punished and which should be excluded from the criminal system. The struggle to impose a particular discourse on criminality is a critical issue under the current criminal-political setting. This paper discusses the discriminatory liberal criminal model which, on the one hand, legitimizes the enforcement of the criminal system over underprivileged classes and on the other, displaces specific social conflicts by means of the powerful classes’ exclusion discourse"
"June 10, 2010","This paper seeks to maintain this purpose. Its aim is to study the rhetoric of independence, understanding rhetoric is not a figure of speech, but the logical units of discourse that accompanied the reactionary actions of the nineteenth century. The rhetorical repertoires played a vital role in the events of Independence, the more so because the explanation must relate causal links, assumptions and arguments that must be confronted, not with other facts, but with other texts, representations and rhetoric. Moreover, the celebration of Independence is also a celebration of the power of words."
"June 10, 2010","This Article examines the effects of incremental domestic legislation on international negotiations to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  Mitigating the effects of climate change is a global public good, which, ultimately, only an international agreement can provide.   The common presumption (justified or not) is that national legislation is a step forward to an international agreement.  This Article analyzes how national legislation can create a demand for international action but can also preempt or frustrate international efforts. The crucial issue, which has been largely ignored thus far, is how incremental steps at the domestic level alter international negotiations.  This paper identifies four mechanisms that support the intuitive idea that national legislation will have positive effects: (1) allocating economic resources, (2) providing leadership in international negotiations, (3) creating a demand for a uniform standard, and (4) cultivating public opinion.  This Article demonstrates that, on closer examination, each of these mechanisms could hinder international efforts to create a comprehensive agreement.  This is by no means an argument against all efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions at the national level.  Instead, this Article calls for a more careful analysis the dynamic political impact of domestic proposals."

"June 09, 2010","In recent years, several people detained by the United States during the “war on terror” have brought Bivens actions seeking compensation from executive officials for alleged constitutional torts. These suits are “inevitable” and will become increasingly common. Opponents and victims of the “war on terror” view a Bivens right of action as an appropriate safeguard for human rights and the rule of law, and have focused on securing the availability such suits. While “war on terror” Bivens plaintiffs face challenges inherent in the “nearly dead” Bivens right of action, the Bivens obstacles to relief are not insurmountable."
"June 09, 2010","The prohibition on the use of reprisals is widely regarded as one of the most sacrosanct statements of the jus in bello applicable to the conduct of modern hostilities. The textual formulations are stark and subject to no derogations. Supporters of the bright line ban describe it as a vital “bulwark against barbarity.” In the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the prohibition is “absolute”, despite the fact that the declarations of key states indicate residual ambiguity over the scope of permissible reprisals, particularly in the context of non-international armed conflicts. Reprisals are a recurring feature of state practice, though conducted under varying legal rubrics and shifting rationales. Reasonable reprisals grounded on an empirical assessment of their deterrent value or framed as appropriate punishment for prior acts of terror may be the most morally acceptable and humane strategy for serving a strategic imperative of civilized society. Limited reprisals may in practice be essential to counteract the growing threat of transnational terrorists. Reasonable reprisals may represent the best long term way to erode support for those who would mobilize terrorist actors to willfully ignore the rules protecting innocent civilians thereby violating the most basic human rights of their victims. This is especially true if nations create clear lines of agreed legal authorities supported by independent adjudication of the motives and methods employed in such reprisals. Peace-loving states should seek common ground to enhance efforts to protect innocent citizens from the effects of terrorist violence. Thoughtful and multilateral reassessment of the lawful scope and rationale for reasonable reprisals is overdue."
"June 09, 2010","Religion represents one of the most powerful and volatile social forces confronted by the state. It predates the state and, by its own confession, promises to outlive the state. Through its ability to meet the spiritual and existential needs of people, it unites and motivates its adherents far more effectively than any other social institution – or the state itself. When directed towards violence, religious followers act with abandon.  As such, throughout recorded history the state has sought to control religion, through law, so as to harness its power for state purposes and avoid religion becoming a threat to its own control or its very existence."
"June 09, 2010","Many in the international law and foreign affairs communities are concerned about an incident which occurred on March 8, 2009, in the South China Sea, involving the United States Naval Ship Impeccable and five vessels from the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Only a small percentage of those communities, however, are familiar with the March 8th incident in substantial detail, both factually and legally. Although the episode was reported by the news media, such reporting was merely the “first rough draft of history.” Therefore, much like how a courtroom trial provides a community with an opportunity to step back and dispassionately examine an alleged crime or civil wrong with deliberate consideration, so too is there value in stepping back and reflecting upon this maritime incident in greater depth on its one-year anniversary. Effective reflection on the incident can occur only when detached observers have an opportunity to weigh the actual facts of that day, apply international law to those facts, and reach a well-considered legal judgment – in essence, a “verdict” – on the incident. To reach such an informal verdict, these observers must be presented with detailed perspectives from the two nations involved. This Article provides such a detailed perspective from one of the two nations – in this case, the United States. The discussion focuses on and synthesizes with meticulous detail the official statements and comments and physical documentation (i.e., video and photographs) released by the United States and PRC governments."
"June 08, 2010","Using historical data on early settlers to the United States, this paper tests and confirms the “Culture of Honor” hypothesis by socio-psychologists Dov Cohen and Richard Nisbett (1994, 1996). This hypothesis argues that the high prevalence of homicides in the US South stems from the fact that it was a frontier region settled by people whose economy was based on herding: the Scotch-Irish. Herding societies develop cultures of honors for reasons having to do with their precariousness: violence is a necessary condition to preserve a reputation for toughness and deter animal theft. Using historical census data on waves of settlers from Europe and relating contemporaneous violence to early Scotch-Irish settlers, this paper provides a test of the link between Scotch-Irish settlers and the culture of honor. The results confirm that high numbers of Scotch-Irish immigrants to the US South by 1790 are associated with higher homicide rates today, including homicides by white offenders. Similar results do not hold for different origins of migrants or other violent crime or offenses. The effect is stronger in counties with high headcounts of pigs and sheep in the 19th century, confirming the herding origin of the culture of honor. An important contribution of this paper is to suggests an instrument for violence, based on past economic occupations and ecological suitability for herding vs. farming."
"June 08, 2010","In describing the nature of the international system international relations contemporary theorists frequently divide themselves into two groups: neorealists and neoliberalists. The neorealists emphasise an anarchical structure, drawing implications from this anarchy to explain the order and disorder that greets the analyst of international affairs. Theirs is a system of conflicting interests and, oftentimes, conflicting actors. Conversely, neoliberalists favour an explanation that focuses on the interdependence of international actors. These theorists instead point to what they claim are more significant implications arising from international interactions between actors, both foreign and domestic. The two groups and their different conceptions of the same international system result in a disciplinary divide, the so-called ‘neo-neo debate’ in international relations theory."
"June 08, 2010","Since the creation of Meghalaya in 1972, the state had been raven by inter-ethnic conflicts between the indigenous tribals against the non-tribals. The steady rise of economic migrants, mainly non-tribals from Bangladesh, Nepal and some other parts of India resulted in uneasiness among the locals. These migrants began to dominate business establishments, labour force and other employment opportunities. As a result the state witnessed ethnic riots between indigenous tribals and migrant non-tribals in 1979, 1987 and 1992. However, since the late 1990s there is a relative change in the nature of ethnic relation between the communities. While the relations between the tribals and non-tribals comparatively improved, the nature of ethnic tensions shifted to the so-called indigenous tribes of the state. This article mainly focuses these emerging ethnic relations between the indigenous tribes of Meghalaya."
"June 08, 2010","This paper is presented in three parts. Part One reviews recent research in the discipline suggesting that the nature of the international system may be chaotic instead of a much more widely assumed anarchy. Part Two considers one of these drawbacks – the need to include superficially inconsequential actors and interactions in a chaotic theory of international politics – in sharper focus. In a concise but detailed assessment of what has been termed the “problem of interdependence” (Kissane, 2006: 20), this part of the paper outlines precisely why this presents a quandary for chaoticians in the discipline of international relations. In Part Three, however, this paper argues that it is possible to overcome the ‘problem of interdependence’ by first analysing and then adopting techniques from natural sciences that have already encountered and adapted their approaches in integrate chaos. Specifically drawing on meteorology and theoretical physics, this part of the paper suggests two routes by which international relations can theorise a chaotic international system. The paper concludes with the suggestion that a chaotic theory of international relations is potentially one step closer to emerging."
"June 08, 2010","At the end of the Cold War realist scholars assessed the future of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) pessimistically. Predictions included inevitable war and conflict as a result of the collapse of the bipolar international system and a concurrent collapse of the Soviet Union. Some realists predicted the rise of a new European powers and rampant nuclear proliferation across Europe. Realist John Mearsheimer went so far as to suggest that only through “limited and carefully managed proliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe”, “active balancing” by European powers and the control of nationalism in Eastern Europe would the continent remain peaceful."
"June 08, 2010","This paper compares American grand juries and Canadian investigative hearings as devices to compel persons to provide information for terrorism investigations in light of comparable protections against self-incrimination in both countries. The main protections of the constitutional right against self-incrimination may be too parochial in an era of global terrorism and the assertion of universal jurisdiction to prosecute terrorism. The main distorting effects are 1) attempts to delay the compelled testimony of a person detained as a material witness and to use compelled self-incrimination to engage in preventive detention, 2) attempts to use the fruits of compelled incrimination in jurisdictions that do not have to respect use and derivative use immunity, and 3) the use of contempt or perjury charges arising from the attempt to compel testimony rather than trials on the merits of the terrorism investigation. The distorting effects may be the price that a society has to pay for respecting constitutional protections against self-incrimination. The paper examines how Canadian investigative hearings offer more protections for compelled persons than American grand juries particularly in light of the Supreme Court of Canada’s extension of use and derivative use immunity for compelled testimony to extradition and deportation proceedings."
"June 08, 2010","In physics, biology and meteorology, scientists have come to understand that the natural systems they study can be extremely sensitive to small events. The so-called ‘butterfly effect’ is testament to such seemingly insignificant events having significant implications for the wider system. Such knowledge has led to an interest in the natural sciences in both chaotic and complex systems and, in turn, has led to social scientists searching for parallels in the systems they examine. However, within the field of international relations theory, there has been little attempt to move towards such new understandings and away from a fundamental belief in anarchy as the defining feature of international politics. This paper offers a critique of this almost-discipline wide stance, drawing on inter-disciplinary approach and suggesting that in the example of the origins of World War One there exists evidence for an international system that is something other than anarchical."
"June 07, 2010","Power cycle theory, arising primarily from the work of Charles F. Doran, determines a sovereign state’s relative share of total power within a wider system of like states. Using unweighted measures of national material capabilities across five indicators, the power cycle method allows the analyst to estimate the relative hierarchical position of each state in a defined system or set of states, the rapidity of each state’s rise and decline in relative power and to forecast the likely future for each state in the system under review. The mapped ‘curve of relative power’ for a state also allows the analyst to determine ‘critical points’ on the curve. These points usually correlate strongly and positively with the incidence of conflict initiated or encountered by the state in question."
"June 07, 2010","This Review Essay surveys the recent literature on the tensions between of autonomy and accountability in robotic warfare. Four books, taken together, suggest an original account of fundamental changes taking place in the field of IHL: P.W. Singer’s book Wired for War: the Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century (2009),  William H. Boothby’s Weapons and the Law of Armed Conflict  (2009), Armin Krishnan’s Killer Robots: Legality and Ethicality of Autonomous Weapons (2009), and Ronald Arkin’s Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots (2009). This Review Essay argues that from the point of view of IHL the concern is not the introduction of robots into the battlefield, but the gradual removal of humans. In this way the issue of weapon autonomy marks a paradigmatic shift from the so-called “humanization” of IHL to possible post-human concerns."
"June 07, 2010","This paper considers this post-9/11 reality in France in three parts. Firstly, the existing passenger and luggage screening processes at both French airports and French train stations will be explained, compared and contrasted. From this it will be clear that the latter lacks both the attention and rigour of the former. Secondly, the specific weak points in the screening processes associated with the French TGV rail network will be assessed and the opportunities for terrorist infiltration that result will be explored. Thirdly, the paper will identify the three factors most responsible for the failure to implement a passenger and luggage screening strategy on the TGV network: the imagined risk, the cost of implementation and the resultant inconvenience to passengers. Applying examples from inside France, wider Europe and North America, each of these factors will be critiqued and rejected as adequate reasons for the lack of screening procedures. In concluding the paper, it will be argued that the continuing failure to screen passengers and luggage travelling on the French TGV network represents a significant hole in the French counter-terrorist strategy and one that should be addressed by policy makers with urgency."
"June 07, 2010","According to many theoretical realists, power in international relations can be measured with attention to material capabilities, the extent influence over other states and even single factors such as military might. Further, for realists the greatest powers in the international system are states or coalitions of states, with international organisations, corporations, transnational groups and individuals barely registering in terms of power in most realist theory. One of the reasons for this state-centricity is the assumption by realists of an anarchic system. Faced with theorising international systemic anarchy, the realists and, indeed, most international relations theorists looking at the notion of power focussed only on the largest and most prominent actors, the states. Yet if a theorist assumes a systemic order which is something other than anarchic then different assumptions about the nature and place of power must also be made. Should the system be assumed to be complex - as some recent research argues - then not only does the nature of power change but also its location for, in a complex system, even the smallest and seemingly most insignificant actor can effect changes of a system-changing nature. This paper argues that the turn towards the assumption of systemic complexity in international relations theory requires more than a simple re-assessment of the realist assumption of anarchy; it also requires a redefinition of key notions of international relations, such as power, and, thus, a paradigm shift in the field itself."
"June 05, 2010","The Furundzija decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia stands as a landmark decision in international jurisprudence since it not only affirmed that the norm prohibiting torture has attained jus cogens status under international law, but expanded accountability and liability for violations of commission as well as omission. In this essay, I not only address Furundzija’s holdings and its implications in the international sphere, but specifically analyze the legacy of the Furundzija judgment on U.S. domestic civil cases involving the Alien Tort Statute."
"June 05, 2010","This paper explores the role of culture in two important events in the history of the separatist struggle in the Muslim South of Thailand. The first event was the “gentlemen’s agreement” of 1943, promising Britain’s support for independence or annexation to British Malaya in exchange of military and intelligence support against the Japanese, between the traditional Melayu leadership and the British Colonial Office represented by the commander of the British forces in Malaya during World War II. Emic and etic explanations are provided from the point of view of the Melayu leardership and of the British. The second event that is discussed is more complex and involves Malaysia’s support for the separatist movement and subsequent negotiations during the 1980s between Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur leading to an agreement stipulating that Malaysia would cease aiding the separatist movement in exchange of Thailand’s support against the Communist Party of Malaya along the porous Thai-Malay border. Finally, a brief conclusion summarizes the importance of culture in the history of the separatist movement of Southern Thailand."
"June 05, 2010","For many years, the judicial activism of the Israeli Supreme Court constituted one of the most impassioned debates in Israeli politics, particularly in respect of the definition of the role which the highest judicial institution in the country should play in military issues. The Supreme Court’s most controversial interventions pertain to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and these are so numerous that the Court can be considered an active player in the task of defining what the Israeli Defence Forces are allowed to do or not in warfare. This judicial activism in the realm of the IDF’s ethics is rooted in the wide-scale phenomenon of the “judicialization” of politics and of the entire public sphere in Israel. This phenomenon has contributed to the emergence of a new culture within the armed forces, which is characterized by a deep awareness that the Supreme Court can, at any time, intervene, control and, if necessary, punish."
"June 04, 2010","This article explores the many bargaining failures that may occur at every stage in intrastate disputes: before fighting breaks out, as a war is being fought, and once a war ends. It argues that disputes that occur within states are particularly susceptible to information and commitment problems. It also reveals why certain countries have more difficulty overcoming these problems than others do. This represents the most comprehensive overview to date of bargaining failures associated with civil wars."
"June 04, 2010","This article reviews the literature on the onset and dynamics of domestic terrorism, with special emphasis on the interactions between terrorist organizations, the state, and society. Because this literature has often been based on case studies, we seek to impose some structure to its findings. We challenge the distinction between domestic and international terrorism, which truncates the sample of violence, and we show that the actor-sense of terrorism (violence carried out by underground organizations) is the most appropriate model for causal analysis. Terrorist organizations tend to emerge in developed countries in which the state is able to prevent the loss of control over any part of its territory. Terrorists take advantage of the state's mistakes (when, for example, it is over-repressive or makes ineffective concessions) in order to boost their support. Terrorists cannot survive without some degree of support. Consequently, levels of violence and targets are determined by social constraints."
"June 04, 2010","The past century of research has identified a host of economic, political, demographic, and other factors that seem to be associated with the prevalence of riots. The study of riots has, however, probably focused too much on these â€œpushâ€? factors that lead to violence and not enough on understanding the response of the state to riots. Understanding the political incentives that motivate democratic and authoritarian states to sometimes allow riots to take place and at other times to take the strongest possible law-and-order measures to prevent them is key to understanding variation in violence. Scholars also need to pay more attention to the psychological factors that encourage people to riot, and to the micro-logic of target choice within these larger events."
"June 04, 2010","Following an initial hearing on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drone warfare by the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs on March 23, 2010, the Subcommittee held a second hearing, Drones II, focusing specifically on the legal issues raised by drone warfare and targeted killing.  The witnesses represented a wide range of legal positions on the question of drones, the use of force, armed conflict, and the roles of the military and the CIA - Kenneth Anderson (American-Hoover), William Banks (Syracuse), David Glazier (Loyola Los Angeles), and Mary-Ellen O'Connell (Notre Dame), with written submissions by Michael Lewis (Ohio Northern) and the ACLU."
"June 04, 2010","It is the aim of this article to demonstrate that the impact of coups d’état in international political discourse outweighs actual consequences under the law of responsibility in international law. This article argues that - leaving aside the hypothesis of effective control by a foreign state - coups d’état, despite being systematically condemned in political discourse, do not engage the responsibility of any state as they cannot be attributed to any international legal subject. The article however argues that coups can constitute preparatory actions to a subsequent internationally wrongful act."
"June 04, 2010","This Article has two primary objectives. The first is to trace the use of force to protect the freedom of travel on the high seas and the right to engage in commerce. This historical context shows that the use of force against piracy off the coast of Somalia is not unprecedented. However, given the increase in military capabilities and the lethality of war in the last century, the use of force against piracy must adhere to the requirements of necessity and proportionality."
"June 04, 2010","This article focusing on torture meted out to female prisoners of war is a detailed account of the various methods of torture used on female detainees of war, either to extract information and confessions forcefully or to take revenge against their men, who may have participated actively in hostilities, from the opposition camps. It is noteworthy that there are secret detention centers operating in different parts of the world where female prisoners may be lodged and subjected to physical abuse, for absolutely no valid reason. Detainees are often not granted Prisoner of War (POW) Status in order to deprive them of their basic rights and subsequently to make them soft targets for torture and inhuman treatment."
"June 03, 2010","This article is a response to the challenge of nuclear non-proliferation for the 21st century. It describes the new landscape of nuclear risk and explains the role that the extraordinary developments in nuclear forensics science can play in generating an expansive deterrence to improve nuclear security by governments, and diminish the nuclear risk presented by terrorists and other non-state actors. Exploring the potential of nuclear forensics science, it provides the analysis to understand why that potential is not being realized. The article then proposes, as a practical and achievable foundation for a new and expansive deterrence, the establishment of an international nuclear forensics data bank, and the legal and institutional basis required. It explains the superiority of the proposed international data bank to alternative modalities of nuclear risk reduction such as the imposition of sanctions, revealing the guiding principles for effective nuclear containment in the twenty-first century."
"June 03, 2010","The industrial relations system at Magna International is an example of an integrated, coherent, non-union human resource management strategy. It includes significant mechanisms of worker voice and conflict resolution as substitutes for union representation. Potential labour-management conflicts associated with Taylorized labour processes are often translated into group problem-solving. Redistributive conflicts are re-framed as mutual gains through profit-sharing. Corporate communications promote an ethos of competitiveness. Individualized pay and promotion schemes, segmented internal labour markets, and the exposure of individual plants to competitive pressures, promote cultures of labour cooperation in the pursuit of productivity gains. The success of this union avoidance model is situated in a context of the erosion of unionized labour relations, the disciplinary effects of precarious labour markets, and the vulnerability of workplaces to transnational competitive forces. Continued success is predicated on Magna’s ability to survive sectoral and macroeconomic restructuring forces which are, in large measure, beyond management’s control."

"June 02, 2010","The U.S. approach to armed conflict has recently undergone a profound shift as policymakers and military commanders have been forced to seek solutions to the seemingly intractable problems associated with developing countries and their relative instability. This focus on reconstruction and stabilization has led to the rise of “stability operations” – a relatively new addition to the military lexicon. Moreover, what is now called “stability operations” is a hybrid area that fuses a core military mission with a field of knowledge and experience that is dominated, at least in theory, by civilians. In that regard, there is another grey area surrounding the question of what conduct disqualifies a civilian from the protections and immunity traditionally given to civilians during armed conflict. The resultant lack of clarity can translate into significant legal consequences – both for civilians who are mobilized pursuant to such an effort and for U.S. policymakers who seek to criminalize the conduct of terrorists and insurgents."
"June 02, 2010","This is the opening chapter of the first entire academic journal issue devoted to the specific role of the UN Security Council in implementing the responsibility to protect. The Security Council’s role in implementing the responsibility to protect is not limited to taking collective action against mass atrocities (pillar three). The Council can also make important contributions to structural and operational prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity (pillar two). It regularly mandates UN peace operations to support security sector reform and the establishment of effective judicial authorities in post-conflict countries. By doing so, it strengthens the national protection capability of states that typically face a high risk of relapse into mass violence. When the Security Council mandates peace operations to support the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants it also strengthens the fabric of a post-conflict society. In addition, the Council can conduct preventive diplomacy under Chapter VI of the UN Charter to encourage states to fulfill their responsibility to protect as they confront a crisis. The contributions by the Security Council to the implementation of the responsibility to protect complement the important roles of the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Peacebuilding Commission and other United Nations bodies. All contributions of the Security Council to the implementation of the responsibility to protect have to occur within the scope of the authority granted to the Security Council by the UN Charter."
"June 02, 2010","Genocide is a crime with a double mental element, i.e. a general intent as to the underlying acts, and an ulterior intent with regard to the ultimate aim of the destruction of the group. The prevailing view in the case-law interprets the respective ‘intent to destroy’ requirement as a special or specific intent (dolus specialis) stressing its volitional or purpose-based tendency. While this view has been followed for a long time in legal doctrine without further ado, it has recently been challenged by knowledge- and structure-based approaches, which have not received sufficient attention. A historical, literal, systematic and teleological interpretation of the ‘intent to destroy’ requirement, taking into account the particular structure of the genocide offence and the meaning of ‘intent’ in comparative law, reveals that the traditional view can no longer be maintained. It should be replaced by a combined structure- and knowledge-based approach that distinguishes according to the status and role of the (low-, mid- and top-level) perpetrators. Thus, the purpose-based intent should be upheld only with regard to the top- and mid-level perpetrators, whereas for the lowlevel"
"June 02, 2010","Khadr and Charkaoui II highlighted that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (“CSIS”) has constitutional and statutory obligations to retain and disclose secret intelligence. Although the two cases were made outside of the criminal context, they, when combined with McNeil, have implications for the retention and disclosure of intelligence in terrorism prosecutions. The two decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada have the potential to subject secret intelligence to the rule of law, external verification and adversarial challenge in legal proceedings."
"June 01, 2010","This review examines how India perceives its own rise to power by undertaking a detailed analysis of the Indian National Security Index (NSI) for the period from 2003 to 2008. Like other power formulas, the NSI includes various indicators of power, though it is uniquely Indian in that it initially emphasized human development and later included ecology based on a holistic human‐security paradigm. The analysis demonstrates that this holistic approach has now been abandoned in favor of a more conventional one, and that the technical formulas and theoretical concepts of the NSI exhibit various inconsistencies and problems. In particular, one can recognize the absolute need for a unified standard for handling variables in the construction of composite indexes in general."
"June 01, 2010","This article applies a modified version of the theoretical approach of the Copenhagen School to demonstrate that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has since 2001 reacted in a twofold way to the complex political obstacles to closer counter-terrorism co-operation: First, it has responded with securitising terrorism as a transnational crime and, second, with a depoliticisation and ‘ASEANisation’ of its counter-terrorism policies. Depoliticisation and ‘ASEANisation’, i.e. the framing of a security threat under the ASEAN Way values, are both deliberate political actions. They enable politicians to base co-operation among the ASEAN members and with outside powers on a non-political, technical basis. Contradicting an assumption of the Copenhagen School, this study argues that in South-East Asia where sovereignty and non-interference are still core principles this approach can offer better political opportunities to resolve a security threat than a ‘classic’ securitisation. Furthermore, this article demonstrates that ASEAN’s anti-terrorism policies reflect its fragmented version of human security, which is based on national and regime rather than individual security. As counter-terrorism does not enjoy political priority in the region, these policies can only be a weak trigger for the implementation of ASEAN’s notion of human security."
"June 01, 2010","The use of the Weibull distributions showed some success over a decade ago in stochastically  explaining processes of political conflict, but there seems to be so little work in this field that its utility is in danger of becoming forgotten. This paper is historical in that it presents two papers by Petersen originally published in 1977 and 1981 that provide an overview of his approach with extended illustration of its use. The overall technique is also explained. The main illustration provided is that of the Sino-Indian boarder dispute of the 1960s, a development of Smoker's original time series study."
"May 29, 2010","Since the adoption of the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon strategy, convergence of social protection goals and labour market policies across EU countries features prominently on the European agenda. Embedded in convergence, Europeanisation and welfare state literature, this paper examines the role of European integration in changing social policies. It shows that since 1995, social expenditures of EU member states have converged and increased on average, whereas those of non-EU countries have diverged, corrected for cyclical and demographic effects. This EU-specific convergence pattern of social expenditures leads to the subsequent question whether or not national policies also have converged. Relying on disaggregated expenditure data and policy indicators, this study shows an EU-specific trend of increasing activation of labour market policies. However, within this scope of activation, countries have opted for different mixes of policy instruments."
"May 28, 2010","Using two theoretical categories of the work of Robert Nozick: (a) protection agencies and (b) minimal state, to illustrate by analogy with the CMSP, the dilemmas arising from the use of private military in regions with civil wars and conflicts irregular. We see that the relations preserved PBMC protection agencies (AP) as they act and are consolidated as an economic market and through coalitions that can replace the monopoly of force of modern states. Indeed, protection agencies to Nozick the same characteristics of the new mercenary armies, only the latter have managed to systematize their methods of recruitment services in the wider protection market."
"May 28, 2010","Of War and Law seems to be animated by a certain philosophical perplexity regarding the ambiguous relation between the apparently antithetical nature of the terms appearing in its title.Since antiquity both jurists and philosophers have taught that law’s raison d’être is that of making social peace possible, of overcoming what would later be commonly known as the Hobbesian state of nature: bellum omnium contra omnes. Kant noted that law should be perceived first and foremost as a pacifying tool – in other words, ‘the establishment of peace constitutes, not a part of, but the whole purpose of the doctrine of law’– and Lauterpacht projected that same principle onto the international sphere: ‘the primordial duty’ of international law is to ensure that ‘there shall be no violence among states’.The paradox, of course, lies in that law performs its pacifying function not by means of edifying advice, but by the threat of the use of force. In this sense, as David Kennedy points out, ‘to use law is also to invoke violence, at least the violence that stands behind legal authority’. Hobbes himself never concealed the fact that the state, ‘that mortal god, to which we owe under the immortal God our peace and defence’, would succeed in eradicating inter-individual violence precisely due to its ability to ‘inspire terror’; but Weber (‘the State is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory’), Godwin, and Kelsen have also provided support for the same proposition."
"May 27, 2010","The recognition of citizens’ rights and the constitution of different citizenships in Latin America have followed a socio-historic pattern as in other parts of the World. Marshall (1964) identified three types of citizenship referring to the British case: the civil, which refers to the main individual liberty rights; the political, which gives the right to elect and be elected; and the social, which covers those rights aimed at the well being of the population. These types of citizenship form today a modern one, which answers to a horizontal logic as all different citizenships become one. Our essay’s objective is to show that the Colombian internally displaced people (IDP’s) could be classified as follows: Firstly, as “Social Supercitizens” thanks to the recognition of their condition as vulnerable population and the application of positive discrimination measures (health, education, and housing) which aim at producing social well being. Secondly, as political and civil subcitizens, those are not a priority in any political agenda and have no guarantee in relation to their basic rights and participation in public life."
"May 27, 2010","We use data from an innovative nationally representative survey of 6,000 Pakistanis in April 2009 to study beliefs about political Islam, Sharia, the legitimacy and efficacy of jihad, and attitudes towards specific militant organizations. These issues are the forefront of US policy towards Pakistan. Four results shed new light on the politics of militancy and Islamic identity in Pakistan. First there is no relationship between measures of personal religiosity and the likelihood a respondent expresses highly sectarian sentiments. Second, militarized jihad is widely seen as legitimate in Pakistan but there are substantial regional differences in the acceptance of militarized jihad. Third, attitudes towards militant groups vary dramatically across groups, particularly when it comes to the efficacy of their actions. Fourth while Pakistanis express massive levels of support for Sharia law this is driven by its perceived connection with good governance, not by sympathy with the goals of militant groups claiming to implement it."
"May 27, 2010","In recent years, legal scholars and practitioners alike have expressed major misgivings about the advice that the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) provided to former President George W. Bush following the attacks of September 11, 2001. On February 19, 2010, House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. released internal communications of the Justice Department that uniformly and definitively discredit – in multiple and material aspects – the OLC’s now-infamous August 1, 2002, “torture memoranda”. The debate about what the OLC got wrong is over. It is time to consider what went wrong with the OLC."
"May 27, 2010","During the 2008 presidential campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama stated: “Sometimes, the preventive use of force may be necessary, but rarely. The experience of Iraq underscores that often, perceived threats are not as real [as] they may seem, and our intelligence may be imperfect. But, when our intelligence is good and defensible we should not rule out the use of force.” This chapter examines ways of assessing legally whether that intelligence is sufficiently good and defensible. It argues that an objective reasonable necessity approach to WMD capability assessments can serve long-term peace and security objectives and, more specifically, how the law governing use of force might evolve to guide capability assessments. A reasonable necessity approach, combined with an objective standard of assessing WMD capability and operating as a narrow legal alternative to formal U.N. Security Council authorization, can best balance and allocate competing risks in an environment of significant capability uncertainty. Moreover, the substantive evidentiary issues forced to the surface through objective reasonableness analysis are critical to managing some of the dangers of operating outside explicit U.N. Security Council authority, and are critical to the effective operation of the legal processes that the strict UN Charter constructionists advocate."
"May 27, 2010","This article considers a major debate in the American and European counterterrorism analytic community – whether the primary terrorist threat to the West is posed by hierarchical, centralized terrorist organizations operating from geographic safe havens, or by radicalized individuals conducting a loosely organized, ideologically common but operationally independent fight against western societies –  and this debate’s implications for both jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Analysis of how the law of armed conflict might be evolving to deal with terrorism should engage in more nuanced and sophisticated examination of how terrorism threats are themselves evolving. Moreover, the merits of legal reform proposals depend on their capacity to meet strategic needs while protecting humanitarian, liberty, and conflict-resolution interests. That capacity, in turn, depends on how well the assumptions underlying those proposals track accurately the anticipated – but uncertain – future terrorism threat environment."

"May 26, 2010","Since World War II there have been about fifty episodes of large-scale mass killings of civilians and massive forced displacements. They were usually meticulously planned and independent of military goals. We provide a model where conflict onset, conflict intensity and the decision to commit mass killings are all endogenous, with two main goals: (1) to identify the key variables and situations that make mass killings more likely to occur; and (2) to distinguish conditions under which mass killings and military conflict intensity reinforce each other from situations where they are substitute modes of strategic violence. We predict that mass killings are most likely in societies with large natural resources, significant proportionality constraints for rent sharing, low productivity and low state capacity. Further, massacres are more likely in a civil than in an interstate war, as in the latter group sizes matter less for future rents. In non polarized societies there are asymmetric equilibria with only the larger group wanting to engage in massacres. In such settings the smaller group compensates for this by fighting harder in the first place. In this case we can talk of mass killings and fighting efforts to be substitutes. In contrast, in polarized societies either both or none of the groups can be ready to do mass killings in case of victory. Under the 'shadow of mass killings' groups fight harder. Hence, in this case massacres and fighting are complements."

"May 26, 2010","Discussion of civil liberties during wartime often omit the fact that there can be no meaningful liberty at all if our homes and offices are bombed or our loved ones are killed or injured by acts of terror. The Government must be given the tools necessary to accomplish its vital mission. The first priority must be to win the war against terrorism. There are, however, other priorities. The United States, in its just battle for freedom, must ensure that freedom is preserved during that battle as well. Moreover, care must be taken so that an exaggerated cry of “emergency” is not accepted uncritically as an excuse for eliminating the protections of a free society. The role of citizens in general, and lawyers in specific, is to maintain the difficult balance between patriotism and skepticism."
"May 25, 2010","After decades of civil conflict leading to massive internal displacement of people, Northern Uganda is peaceful again and hundreds of thousands of displaced people are relocating. Using data from maps and satellite imagery, we examine the placement of homes before, during and after the conflict. Examining two study sites, one that experienced a great deal of violence over an extended period of time and one where the experience of violence was more limited, we observe the clustering of home placement in the post-conflict period. As resettlement occurs, there is also evidence of increased location of homes in close proximity to roads in the site with high levels of violence. This research informs what we presently know about the choices of returnees and has implications for service provision and the reclamation of property rights after conflict."
"May 25, 2010","This article explores data relating to public support for Iran’s nuclear program, using data from 2006 collected by Fair working with a consortium of institutional partners. The authors evaluate a few general hypotheses from the literature regarding support for nuclear programs using these new data from Iran. Before presenting empirical results, they first provide some background to this poll and some of the challenges that the team encountered. This discussion illuminates both the strengths and weaknesses of the data that undergrid this study. Second, they address some of the questions about the relevance and integrity of data collected by the consortium and used in this analysis. They address forthrightly whether or not public opinion matters in a country like Iran and whether polling of Iranians is a useful exercise given the degree of coercion which is ascribed to the regime. They present the top-line results of questions germane to Iranian support for its country’s program and some reasons cited for this support as well as results from logistic regressions, which focuses on key outcome measures which allows them to identify independent variables that explain variation in selected dependent variables. They proffer several analytical lessons that can be drawn from this exercise."
"May 25, 2010","Decision makers in the field of national security, counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are faced with an uncertain, adaptive and asymmetrical threat. It should come as no surprise that a great need exists to understand covert organizations, the structure of which becomes known partially only after an attack or operation has occurred. What is known however is that many covert networks are organized in compartmentalized cellular structures. To better understand these cellular structures we model and analyze these cells as a collection of subsets of all participants in the covert organization, i.e., as hypergraphs or affiliation networks. Since terrorist cells can be viewed as graph theoretical cliques, i.e., everybody in the cell knows everybody else, such a covert affiliation network structure is analyzed by evaluating the one-mode projection of the corresponding hypergraph. First we provide a characterization of the total distance in the one-mode projection using its corresponding cell-shrinked version. Secondly we evaluate the one-mode projection with respect to the secrecy versus information tradeoff dilemma every covert organization has to solve. We present and analyze affiliation networks representing common covert organizational forms: star, path and semi-complete hypergraphs. In addition we evaluate an example of a covert organization wishing to conduct an attack and compare its performance to that of the common covert organizational forms. Finally we investigate affiliation networks that are optimal in the sense of balancing secrecy and information and we prove that among covert organizational forms in the class of hypertrees with the same number of cells uniform star affiliation networks are optimal."
"May 25, 2010","In the absence of a single authoritative mechanism to interpret humanitarian law, a number of treaty bodies, national courts, regional human rights courts/commissions, international tribunals, and thematic mechanisms have been called upon to address humanitarian law issues. Prime among these institutions is the United States Supreme Court. Though only in a small number of cases, the Court has relied on humanitarian law principles and treaties from the early days of the Republic to the “war on terrorism.” In what ways does the Court invoke this body of law and how competent is its analysis? Is the Court institutionally equipped to play a meaningful role in the development of humanitarian law?"

The referendum on the territory’s final status set forth by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has repeatedly been postponed and the so far brokered proposals have been rejected by both parties. Since the Moroccan occupation the Saharawis have been continuously repressed through arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and attacks of the civilian population, persecution and oppression of peaceful demonstrations. The violation of fundamental human rights is an ongoing issue. It is argued that these violations may constitute crimes against humanity, further on this article suggests that the international community should act as soon as possible to end Moroccan impunity and to make greater efforts for a just and lasting solution of the question of Western Sahara."
"May 24, 2010","This paper aims at making a preliminary assessment of China in the WTO dispute settlement system from an international socialization perspective. When China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in November 2001, it was not clear how China would behave in WTO dispute settlement. At first, China proved to be a conciliatory defendant and reluctant complainant. Recently however, China’s profile in dispute settlement has shifted to a more proactive one, leading some observers to label its behavior “aggressive.”"

"May 23, 2010","The absence of an internationally accepted definition of terrorism has led to international lawlessness and unilateral vigilantism.  The post 9/11 War on Terror resulted from the longstanding failure of the international community to agree on a definition of terrorism, which in turn has intensified the war of terrors between the two sides.  From the viewpoint of one side, this is a justified (unilaterally, because this side has capability to move and manage military might and resources) War on Terror to protect human rights, freedoms, civilization and the (self-styled) global rule of law.  This side has labeled its War on Terror a just war by definition, defocusing a possible response mechanism to address the very real problem of international terrorism.  The method of this War on Terror by the coalition of willing nations against insurgents and failed states will lead to likely forfeiture of sovereign equality, hot pursuits of terrorists under the claim of international rule of law without proper application of the UN charter, and so-called justified preventive war and regime change without regard to the interests and human rights of the people of weak or failed states.  The result is a fiercely proclaimed or professed new international law and order.  On the other side, weak or failed states and stateless actors view terror as a justified response to a history of terrorism (a series of events resulting in victimization by domination, colonization, hegemonization, and the silencing of dissent). In order to avoid such a division and debate, the definition of terrorism needs to include the terrorist activities conducted not only by the failed or likely to be failed states and scattered non-state actors, but also should include the terrorist activities engaged in by the powerful states.  This inclusive approach in defining terror has the potential to create an international acceptability to the definition of terrorism.  At the same time, this approach will provide an objective standard for all state and non-state actors to use in response to the problem of terrorism.  Such a clear and inclusive standard might suffer from the lack of traditional enforcement mechanisms in international law; however, it will provide a legal basis for international consensus to criticize and to pressure a country or a group that engages in terrorist activities."
"May 23, 2010","Most scholarship on negotiation ethics has focused on the topics of deception and disclosure. In this Article, I argue for considering a related, but distinct, ethical domain within negotiation ethics. That domain is the ethics of orientation. In contrast to most forms of human interaction, a clear purpose of negotiation is to get the other party to take an action on one's behalf, or at least to explore that possibility. This gives rise to a core ethical tension in negotiation that I call the object-subject tension: how does one reconcile the fact that the other party is a potential means to one's ends with general ethical requirements for treating people? In response, I argue that there is a general moral duty to respect other people, a duty that is not overridden by the fact of negotiation. I examine the nature of this duty and its implications for both direct principal-to-principal negotiations and legal negotiations conducted indirectly through lawyers."
"May 22, 2010","Does ethnicity matter for explaining violence during civil wars? I exploit variation in the identity of soldiers who conducted so-called “sweep” operations (zachistki) in Chechnya (2000–5) as an empirical strategy for testing the link between ethnicity and violence. Evidence suggests that the intensity and timing of insurgent attacks are conditional on who “swept” a particular village. For example, attacks decreased by about 40% after pro-Russian Chechen sweeps relative to similar Russian-only operations. These changes are difficult to reconcile with notions of Chechen solidarity or different tactical choices. Instead, evidence, albeit tentative, points toward the existence of a wartime “coethnicity advantage.” Chechen soldiers, enmeshed in dense intraethnic networks, are better positioned to identify insurgents within the population and to issue credible threats against civilians for noncooperation. A second mechanism - prior experience as an insurgent - may also be at work. These findings suggest new avenues of research investigating the conditional effects of violence in civil wars."
"May 22, 2010","This study revisits Iraqi international migration since the 2003 Iraq War from the perspective of human insecurity, distancing itself from the ‘securitisation of migration’ discourse. International migration from Iraq is a significant case to study because of the central role that the country’s different conflicts have played in changing international migration regimes and geographies. Studying the Iraqi exodus can help policymakers in the fields of international migration, security and political science to have a better understanding of migration and conflict patterns. The reader should bear in mind that Iraq is not a unique case; it is comparable, in varying degrees, to other conflicts and migration movements in other parts of the world. Based on secondary data available from international organisations, this paper will discuss Iraqi international migration with reference to the environment of human insecurity concept formulated in a conflict perspective. I will first present a conceptual framework which seems to be appropriate in explaining international migration flows in conflict zones, and then, I will discuss current Iraqi migration trends along with investigating their implications for the future."
"May 22, 2010","Ethnic conflicts and wars have been a significant factor determining minority populations’ outflow from Iraq. Turkmen as such minority have been subjected to oppression. Limited economic opportunities combined with the effects of wars imposed an environment of insecurity on Turkmen. This has further facilitated and promoted emigration as it offered “opportunity frameworks” for capable segments of this particular ethnic group. This paper presents findings from a survey conducted in Iraq in 2004 reaching 1040 Turkmen households. Systematic discrimination and ongoing internal and international conflicts and wars forced Turkmen as well as others to flee."
"May 22, 2010","We investigate how negotiators’ trait-level belongingness needs chart a course for their negotiations, and ultimately, determine the profitability of their deals. As predicted, the greater negotiators’ belongingness needs, the more stressed they felt in advance of the negotiation, leading these bargainers to reduce their economic aspirations. After the negotiation, the higher bargainers’ belongingness needs, the less accurate they were in reporting their partners’ needs and interests. As predicted, both low aspirations and inaccurate perceptions undermined negotiators’ outcomes. If negotiators were making the calculation initially to trade economic gains for relationship gains, we did not find evidence that this paid off with a partner who wanted to work together again in the future."
"May 22, 2010","The year 2009 started with a major setback in prospects for a negotiated political settlement in Southern Philippines. The so-called Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) between the government of the Philippines under the administration of the President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) was declared unconstitutional by the Philippine Supreme Court and triggered the attacks of “rogue” MILF commanders on several villages, provoking the Philippine military to retaliate leading to the termination of the ceasefire agreement reached in 2003. The consequence has been an estimated 600,000 internally displaced persons staying in improvised evacuation centers and several hundreds of people killed, adding to the estimated death casualties of 100,000 to 150,000 since 1971. This paper aims to explain how come achieved agreements fail to bring the goal of managing the conflict. To answer this question, the paper introduces a conceptual analytical tool how to evaluate agreements reached to settle identity conflicts. Furthermore, this paper intends to introduce the concept of knowledge management that would eventually promote mechanisms of resilience to support agreements to adapt to the challenges brought by changes in the environment. The Southern Philippine case delivers an interesting situation where its classification as an ethnic conflict is rather misleading. This paper is a response to the call of Kit Collier (2004) for an exit to the primordialist approach which has dominated the discourse in the Philippines."
"May 22, 2010","Research studies conducted in a university setting were compared to other research conducted in workplaces. The purpose of this paper is to determine the importance of research setting in conflict research design. A meta-analysis of 28 related papers was conducted to compute effect sizes of the linkages between task conflict, relationship conflict, satisfaction and performance. The impact of the research setting (i.e., university vs. workplace) as a moderator was also tested. The research setting was found to be a significant moderator of the linkage between task conflict and satisfaction, task conflict and performance as well as relationship conflict and performance. In each case of moderation, the effect sizes were much greater when research was conducted in the workplace than in a university setting. Our findings suggest that research conducted in a university setting likely underestimated the impact of conflicts on the level of satisfaction and the degree of performance as compared to research conducted in a workplace setting."
"May 22, 2010","In this paper, I discuss transnational mobility using a perspective that emphasizes conflicts at macro, mezzo and micro levels while seeking ways in which such a conflict model of migration can be developed. I outline areas involving different degrees of conflict which are better seen on a continuous scale ranging from potential and latent tensions to violent conflicts and wars. Conflict aspects contribute to the dynamic nature of transnational human movements and, at the same time, appear to be antithetical to globalisation. The tensions/conflicts at individual, household, community, and state levels are not isolated from each other but inter-connect different levels. Within this conflict conceptualisation, transnational mobility appears as a move from human insecurity to human security."
"May 21, 2010","Introduction: Since 2005 when a Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed between opposing parties in Sudan, over 100,000 Sudanese refugees have returned from Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya after having been living in exile for decades. At Kakuma Camp there are close to 40,000 Sudanese refugees who remain living in exile even though international observers have determined that political and social conditions have improved in Sudan. This study seeks to determine what role these refugees see themselves as having in the post-war reconstruction and development of Sudan; the possible secession of South Sudan; as well as how they believe civil society and Good Governance can be strengthened in Sudan. A particular focus will be made in targeting both educated refugee men and refugee women."
"May 21, 2010","This paper proposes and tests hypotheses drawn from the literature on gender, leadership, and conflict management about the outcomes facilitated by men and women in third party roles in dispute resolution. Results show that when managerial women occupy third party roles in which they lack authority over disputants, they facilitate very different outcomes than men in these roles, or men and women in third party roles with authority. The behavioral data suggest they do so by eschewing the agentic behavior displayed by others taking these third party roles."
"May 21, 2010","It is troubling that so little negotiation and conflict management knowledge exists in a climate change context, as climate change is the largest and most complicated interdependent situation ever confronted on planet earth. This theoretical paper reviews the sparse extant literature and then provides a brief overview to the science of climate change public policy. This review establishes a foundation for examining negotiation and conflict management research questions that emanate from current and future climate change negotiations. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord receives special consideration in this regard. This paper demonstrates how the negotiation and conflict management field can make important contributions to the study of interdependency in a climate change context."
"May 21, 2010","This research represents the first empirical investigation of the agreement bias in negotiation. The agreement bias is a negotiation trap characterized by settling for terms that are worse than one’s alternatives. Results from two experiments indicated that teams reduce the agreement bias by facilitating impasse in negotiations with a negative bargaining zone. Study 1 found that the addition of a single teammate was sufficient for generating discontinuity between teams and solos in their ability to avoid the agreement bias. Study 2 provided support for two proposed explanations for the agreement bias. Consistent with the faulty-judgment explanation, the role that required the most information processing benefited the most from the addition of a teammate. Consistent with the concern-with-being-liked explanation, solos were perceived as exhibiting more agreeable behavior than teams, and agreeable behavior was associated with a greater likelihood of agreement."
"May 21, 2010","The catastrophic dimensions of humanitarian emergencies are increasingly understood and more visible to states and international institutions.  There is greater appreciation for the social, economic and political effects that follow in the short to long term from such catastrophes whatsoever their causes. Rhetorically too, there is some recognition of the gendered dimensions of humanitarian emergencies in policy and institutional contexts. It is generally acknowledged that women are more visible in the refugee and internally displaced communities that typically result from many humanitarian crises. Women, because of their acute care responsibilities in most societies, also disproportionately bear the brunt of familial and communal care responsibilities in communities affected by disaster, war and natural emergencies.  Women, given their disparate social and legal status in many jurisdictions may have less access to capital, social goods and other legal means to protect themselves when crises arise. While tacit acknowledgement of this reality increasingly permeates academic and political discourses, the depth of the descriptive often fails to capture and fully grasp the extent of gender harms and gender insecurity. This article offers some preliminary assessment of the intersection of women’s experiences with situations of humanitarian crisis.  It does so by a survey of three important but frequently marginalized issues namely: vulnerability, masculinities and security in situations of crisis.  In particular the article seeks to explore the particular vulnerabilities experienced by women in the context of humanitarian emergencies. Drawing on Fineman’s theoretical framework ascribing the inevitability of vulnerability, the article proposes a shift in thinking around inevitable dependencies in the international context of humanitarian emergencies that might function to realign our understanding of and response to gendered vulnerabilities.  The work identifies the structural limitations and biases inherent in prevailing humanitarian crisis responses, and maps them onto the masculinities inherent in the standard operating procedures of international organizations and the cadre of experts that typically offer solutions to the society in crisis. The conclusion reflects on the limits of current international legal obligations in addressing women’s harms and needs in the context of humanitarian crises."

A majority of members have never used the DSU, and for those who have used it, participation in dispute settlement can be explained by a number of factors such as trade volume, income level and legal capacity (Francois, Horn and Kaunitz, 2008). It stands to reason that members who use the panel system very little, or hardly at all, are also slow to use it – that there is an inverse correlation between number of dispute panels and time until first dispute."

"May 20, 2010","Some scholars have argued that the United Nations is well-equipped to handle modern threats like terrorism and WMD proliferation, because the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) will authorize the use of force when necessary to deal with these threats.  This article argues that in practice, however, the UNSC generally will fail to authorize the use of force in these situations, because China and Russia - each of which hold veto power in the UNSC - will block any meaningful attempts to counter terrorism and WMD proliferation.  Scholars and policymakers should, therefore, consider a variety of reforms that could allow the United Nations to become a better vehicle through which to address modern threats."
"May 20, 2010","This paper considers the tradeoff between objective, or economic, and subjective, or social-psychological outcomes, in negotiation. While past research has predominantly focused on how factors such as individual differences, situational characteristics, and negotiator strategies influence the former, fewer studies consider the effects on the latter. Whereas some factors may benefit objective and subjective value in tandem, other factors may benefit objective value at the expense of subjective value, or vice versa. The first part of this paper provides examples of factors that are outside of the negotiator’s control but have a parallel, uniform directional influence on objective and subjective value, including dispositional affect, negotiator attitudes, and gender. These are contrasted with factors outside of the negotiator’s control that have a divergent or bi-directional influence on objective and subjective outcomes such as maximizing versus satisficing decision-making tendencies, relational self-construal, and emotional intelligence. The second part of the paper focuses on factors that are within the negotiator’s control, yet have either parallel effects on outcomes such as media richness, humor and rapport, and the use of questions, or divergent effects on outcomes, including number of issues, aspirations, and strategic display of emotion."
"May 20, 2010","Interest in cross-national comparison of transitional justice mechanisms has grown recently, as has the study of truth commissions in particular. However, as is true of many emerging areas of research, progress has been hampered by significant gaps in data and by a lack of consensus as to what constitutes the universe of cases. To address this problem, this article introduces the most comprehensive truth commission database we know to be in existence. First, we describe the process of collecting information on truth commission cases and outline our logic in determining what cases to include in the database. Then, we briefly discuss the attributes of truth commission cases included in the database and explain our reasoning regarding their inclusion. Finally, we use the data to provide an overview of patterns and trends in the use of truth commissions."
"May 19, 2010","This paper argues against the view that Bulgaria’s EU accession was premature and that the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) is not delivering. The EU’s continued leverage and the efficacy of the CVM are explained in a framework that goes beyond the dual-conditionality paradigm of incentives and sanctions, and beyond the unitary players model of EU-Bulgarian relations. In this framework, the CVM is viewed as an instrument for supportive reinforcement rather than for the imposition of sanctions. Furthermore, it is seen as targeting not just the government, but all Bulgarian stakeholders. The CVM is regarded as very effective at the level of public opinion and civil society, and as a mechanism that contributes to ‘sandwiching’ reform-reluctant Bulgarian governments between pressure from Brussels and domestic pressure for reforms. The CVM is also deemed useful for Bulgaria’s further Europeanisation beyond the narrower pre-accession phase of ‘EU-isation’. The paper suggests that eventual post-accession benchmarks might be appropriate in the process of further EU enlargement if properly understood as instruments for granting support and if discussed broadly with stakeholders beyond the executive. Concerning the efficiency/legitimacy dilemma, it is asserted that the CVM is an opportunity for increasing the EU’s legitimacy."
"May 19, 2010","The war in Colombia presents, among other characteristics, a high content of oratorical and rhetoric; the different armed actors are disputed, besides territories, the power of the public opinion, with what each violent action is usually accompanied by a discursive or symbolic justification. The present rehearsal offers an analysis of the paramilitary speech, starting from the declarations and interviews to Carlos Castaño, main boss of the selfdefenses. The paramilitary rhetoric is studied here from the theory of the speech acts of Austin-Searle, the theory of the argument of Chaïm Perelman, and the recent works has more than enough Metaphors of Lakoff- Johnson-Fauconnier. The descriptive analysis of the argumentational techniques and the stratagems of the speech, it throws interesting results to understand partially, the serious reining confusion in the Colombian armed conflict."

"May 19, 2010","Transitional justice provides a potential contribution to the statebuilding process that is both forward-looking and backward-looking. In post-conflict situations, there are often demands for justice for past human rights abuses. A range of transitional justice measures, such as trials, truth commissions, and reparations programs, have emerged around the globe as tools to meet these demands. Post-conflict governments, however, are often confronted with perpetrators who remain powerful and who may have been promised amnesty as a precondition of laying down their arms. A range of other practical and political considerations also frequently come into play in the construction of transitional justice policies. As such, there is potential tension between transitional justice and statebuilding with respect to how these measures are structured and the motivations of their architects."
"May 19, 2010","While there is growing interest in examining what long-term impact truth commissions have on society, our understanding has been hampered by a number of empirical problems. Specifically, most studies focus on a small biased subsample of cases, rely on anecdotal evidence and normative conviction, and fail to follow the truth commission's legacy beyond its immediate reception. What is more, although a range of purposes have been put forward for truth commissions, there is little consensus on what criteria might be used to assess them. These issues are further compounded by a growing chorus of critics who see truth commissions as either ineffectual or dangerous. This article fleshes out the nature of these problems and outlines how a multimethod strategy might be effective in addressing them. Furthermore, it suggests two potential means of assessing the impact of truth commissions, specifically their effect on subsequent human rights practices and democratic development. The article concludes by suggesting how some problems with this strategy can be overcome by further iterations of a multimethod approach."
"May 19, 2010","There is a growing body of comparative research that seeks to produce empirical evidence and, thereby, contribute to policy debates on the relative merits of truth commissions. However, these efforts have been plagued by a lack of attention to case selection. The lack of consensus on what constitutes the universe of truth commission cases has contributed to a pattern of inconclusive, inconsistent findings. This article reviews the empirical literature and finds over 70 potential truth commission cases. After examining some of the reasons behind such disagreement, I offer Freeman’s (2006) typology of investigative commissions as the best suited to advance research in the field."
"May 18, 2010","Since the establishment of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1946, national human rights institutions (NHRIs) have been perceived as desirable and effective mechanisms for the implementation of international human rights standards and procedures at the national level. During the last decade, the establishment of national human rights commissions has taken on a role beyond the usual functions of complaint handling and monitoring of human rights violations and disseminating human rights norms via education and training. As countries emerge from protracted civil wars and regional conflicts, national human rights commissions are increasingly becoming significant players in the implementation and monitoring of peace agreements and post-conflict transitional arrangements. The creation of NHRIs is often a pre-condition to the execution of such agreements, as in the case of Northern Ireland and Afghanistan, or a mandated institution under an interim United Nations transitional administration, as was the case with East Timor. The Nepal Human Rights Commission was already in existence when the Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) was signed in 2006 by the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party Nepal (Maoist) (the CPN-M). Under the CPA, the Commission took on an expanded mandate that required it to monitor adherence by the parties to its extensive provisions."
"May 18, 2010","This 2004 paper is based on an original public opinion survey on nationalism in five East European countries and deals with the grassroots of ethnic conflict in postcommunist Europe, with a special focus on the Balkans. In other words, it is concerned with Milosevic’s voters (and others like them) rather than with the historical circumstances that have the potential to generate ethnic conflict, political environments that allow nationalist leaders to win votes, and political institutions that favor certain outcomes in specific conflict circumstances. Its main goal is to test the hypothesis that mass attitudes or behavior are the main causes of the Balkan ethnic conflict, or of any other ethnic conflict for that matter. Due to its positive association with political fatalism and distrust in politics a model of nationalism emerges from surveys as a substitute ideology, a form of distinctive political identity. Postcommunist nationalism is the ideology of non-ideologues, a form of political assertiveness of the less informed and more frustrated. But most of all, its essence is residual, as it draws on individuals high on communist attitudes such as authoritarianism, and nostalgia for the former regime. From a mass phenomenon in the nineties postcommunist nationalism is bound to see serious decline."
"May 18, 2010","The paper analyzes the criteria used by the Italian Penal System to oppose Islamic terrorism. After explaining the dichotomy between the “American way” versus the “European way” in fighting this phenomenon, the author takes position in the debate regarding the so-called Criminal Law of the enemy, concluding that the fight against terrorism must necessarily go through law and penal jurisdiction, and that is the job of penal science to guide penal law-creating authorities in the search of a balance between public safety and guarantees. Then, the most relevant Italian penal types commonly used in the fight against Islamic terrorism are analyzed. Special consideration is given to participation in a terrorist conspiracy, a figure that, besides being the issue’s main axis, offers the biggest problems with regards to its compatibility with constitutional principles."
"May 18, 2010","Fifteen years after its launch, the impact of the Barcelona Process on the Palestinian Territory is in need of a reassessment. Despite some initial improvements in the political and economic structures, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership alone has failed to anchor a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. In response, the European Neighbourhood Policy was launched to bring out a number of new foreign policy instruments, which induced substantial reforms. Yet the win by Hamas in the 2006 elections brought a halt to the EU’s aid and diplomacy. This boycott proved detrimental, as it widened the rift between the main parties to the point of no reconciliation. Whether the Union for the Mediterranean proves any better than its predecessor policies in the region remains to be seen. This publication aims at providing a broad picture of the EU’s policies towards the Palestinian Territory, in order to draw lessons from them and offer proposals for the way ahead."
"May 17, 2010","Terrorism has been identified as the greatest menace facing the mankind in the 21st century. India has officially identified terrorism as one of the most critical challenges that faces it in the post Iraq war world. The driving force in the global politics since 2/11 is also nothing but terrorism. For some years post 2/11, tackling of terrorism has become a prime agenda of governance and the political and governance sphere has been devising techniques to tackle terrorist menace. However, instead of legal methods, most countries have been resorting to extra legal methods, citing the reason ""extra ordinary circumstances call for extra ordinary measures to tackle them."" These measures include Guantanamo Bay type detention, rendition and similar methods which are facing vehement criticism from human rights advocates. However, the Indian stand against terrorism stands out from this dangerous wrangle that other affected countries are in. India has reposed faith in the judicial system and has gone forward with legal methods, which coupled with strong administrative mechanism, and a sound foreign policy could be an alternative for the so called extra ordinary measures followed by countries like USA. The recent trial of the Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasab, has also brought in much attention to the Indian Judicial response in tackling terrorist menace. This paper examines India judiciary's approach towards terrorism in the light of attempts to define the concept and of the human rights debate surrounding executive approach towards curbing terrorism."
"May 17, 2010","The paper tries to demonstrate que the prosecution of international crimes at the supranational and national level meets various limitations and problems that, one way or the other, can be traced back to the common theme of Realpolitik. The International Criminal Court continues to be an institution in progress and cannot resolve over night centuries long problems of impunity for serious human rights violations. Too high expectations and demands may in the end be counterproductive and lead to the collapse of the ICC. The Rome Statute provides for a very special triggering procedure and (preliminary) investigation. This explains in part why the Prosecutor has not yet opened any investigation (Art. 53 ICC Statute) on the basis of mere communications of the victims (infra 1.). Another reason is that the Prosecutor and the Court depend on the cooperation of states (2.); and this cooperation only occurs if the respective state agrees with the intervention of the ICC or at least tolerates it. While there are certainly ways to put pressure on states that refuse to cooperate (3.) the need of such pressures shows that the Court has already lost. In any case, the final objective of the prosecution of international crimes is not only the prevention of impunity (human rights aspect) but also to improve the national justice systems as a whole (judicial reform aspect) (4.). The principle of universal jurisdiction, as refined as in the German legislation, is only a solution of emergency and may have counterproductive effects (5.)."

"May 17, 2010","In recent years, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has declared “war” on the Mexican drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs). Over 10,000 individuals have been killed in drug related violence between January 2007 and June 2009, with many of the violent deaths concentrated in a few states such as Chihuahua and Sinaloa. I argue that the concentrated nature of the drug related violence is partially shaped by electoral politics. Furthermore, I theorize that the concentrated costs of the anti-narco campaign can be explained by the continued struggle between Calderon's PAN party and the once dominant PRI party. Using regression analysis and after controlling for the number of DTOs that operate in a given state, I ﬁnd that the level of support that the PRI enjoyed in the July 2, 2006 Chamber of Deputies general election is positively correlated with the amount of drug related deaths subsequently experienced in that state between January 2007 through July 2009."
"May 16, 2010","We analyze a class of proportional cake-cutting algorithms that use a minimal number of cuts (n-1 if there are n players) to divide a cake that the players value along one dimension. While these algorithms may not produce an envy-free or efficient allocation – as these terms are used in the fair-division literature – one, divide-and-conquer (D&C), minimizes the maximum number of players that any single player can envy. It works by asking n >= 2 players successively to place marks on a cake – valued along a line – that divide it into equal halves (when n is even) or nearly equal halves (when n is odd), then halves of these halves, and so on. Among other properties, D&C ensures players of at least 1/n shares, as they each value the cake, if and only if they are truthful. However, D&C may not allow players to obtain proportional, connected pieces if they have unequal entitlements. Possible applications of D&C to land division are briefly discussed."
"May 16, 2010","Israel’s extensive cluster munitions (CMs) use in the 2006 Second Lebanon War served as a major impetus for the 2008 Convention on CMs (CCM). It also led to an extensive U.S.-Israeli diplomatic entanglement over Israel’s supposed violations of U.S. legislation, specifically the 1976 classified Bilateral End-User Agreement detailing Israel’s use of U.S.-made CMs. The Article first tracks the Agreement’s inception and the diplomatic crises caused by Israel’s alleged breach since then. The second section provides a detail account of the 2006 crisis while the third analyzes if U.S. legislation was violated. The Article concludes, using a flexible interpretation, that in effect U.S. legislation was not violated and argues that given its out-dated stipulations the Agreement was doomed to be violated under a formal interpretation. More importantly, given the restrictions imposed on Israel by the Agreement, this case provides a unique opportunity to assess the rationale behind the refusal of CCM supporters to accept anything but a total ban on CMs."
"May 16, 2010","This Article reviews both the applicability and desirability of the two vying regimes for state responsibility under international law as applied to cyber attacks:  the effective and overall control standards. Due to the technical difficulties with proving attribution for cyber attacks, along with the unreasonably high burden of proof required by the ICJ’s interpretation of the effective control standard, this Article argues for the adoption of the overall control standard as being both within the best interests of NATO as well as the international community."
"May 15, 2010","This Essay, a contribution to a symposium on Withdrawing from Customary International Law published in the Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law, analyzes the rules governing unilateral exit from multilateral treaties and considers the insights they offer for understanding how unilateral withdrawals from customary international law (CIL) might function in practice.  Drawing upon my previous study of the design and use of treaty denunciation and withdrawal clauses, I argue that if the rules governing unilateral exit from CIL were to track those governing unilateral exit from treaties, states would be subject to a wide array of procedural and substantive constraints on their ability to exit from international laws they no longer intend to follow."
"May 15, 2010","The Niger Delta is a heterogeneous, multiculturally diverse region of 70,000 square kilometers (Saro-Wiwa 1995:165; CRP 1999:31; Tamuno 1999:51) with over 20 different ethnic groups, including those of Yoruba, Edo, Igbo, Izon (Ijaw) and Cross River stock (CRP 1999:7). Several studies (Dike 1965:25; Jones 1963; Alagoa 1964; Ikime 1972; Onosode 2003) have shown that fishing, hunting, trading, farming and salt-making are the traditional occupations of the people. The Niger Delta is one of the three largest wetlands in the world, and the largest in Africa (see The Guardian, Lagos, December 3, 1998:16; Manby 1999a:53; Onosode 2003:8). Quite apart from being hugely endowed with oil and gas deposits, fertile agricultural land, abundant rivers (as well as creeks) and fish, forest and human resources, the Niger Delta also supports a complex bio-diversity and other biological and ecological features, presently the most diverse, sensitive and fragile in Nigeria (Onosode 2003). Three distinct ecological zones predominate in this region. These are the thick mangrove forests bordering the sandy coastal areas that in turn border the Atlantic Coast. There are the fresh-water swamps, and, lastly, the dry land forests that support most of the farming (CRP 1999:12). Kenneth Dike (1965:20) has written that, geographically,... the Delta divides easily into two sections. The Northern section is comparatively drier and higher than the area of swampland to the south. Even in the lowland belt, the dank and humid surroundings with vast stretches of dry land, a maze of islands intersected by creeks and rivers and on these settlements have been built. Some of these southern colonies, being placed on points of control for internal and external commerce, quickly grew in importance and became the trading centers on the Atlantic seaboard."
"May 15, 2010","This paper models how a nation's military manpower procurement system affects popular support for war and political choices regarding war.  When citizens have idiosyncratic benefits from war and costs from serving, I characterize when a volunteer military maximizes support, and when a mixture of volunteer and conscripted forces does.  Pure conscription never maximizes support.  The personnel systems cannot be ranked ex-ante by efficiency, because each makes mistakes the other avoids.  Ceteris paribus, political systems requiring only weak support to initiate wars have more war under pure conscription, while those requiring strong support have more war under a volunteer system."
"May 14, 2010","Conceived as a contribution to the historiographical turn in international law and within this area to the study of national traditions of international legal thought, this works begins by explaining the mermaid’s song of the axis imperial temptation that characterized Spanish international law from 1939 to 1945. In this context, the role played by the reception of Carl Schmitt’s work, both among political and legal theorists with a marked internationalist orientation within the Falangist intelligentsia will be firstly examined. While the intellectual reception of Schmitt was instrumentally aimed at fashioning the theoretical legitimization of the new authoritarian regime, it also mirrored the acute climax of intellectual fascistization of Spain’s combative counter-revolutionary elites between 1939 and 1942. This period of fascist mimesis, that is epitomized by the Franco regime’s foreign policy orientation towards the Axis powers during World War II, is subsequently studied through the influence exerted by the book Reivindicaciones de España and other similar works of neo-colonialist credentials produced by Spanish international lawyers at the time. Secondly, this works examines the Spanish transition from autarchy to international realignment with the West in the period 1945 to 1953. In this context, it is explored how the nationalist reaffirmation of a culture grounded in Catholic conservatism and traditionalism fostered the adoption of a marked thematic orientation towards natural law and the recuperation of the Siglo de Oro’s Salamanca school all in a climate of severe intellectual repression and organically nationalist directed scientific work in Spain. A retrospective attention is paid to the contribution of Spanish authors to the establishment of Padre Vitoria as a founding father of the discipline during the inter-war years and to the related existence of a line of imperialist continuity in Spanish foreign policy vis-à-vis its ancient colonies in both periods. This attention to the revival of natural law and historico-legal studies, which was part of a broader Spanishification on ideological and spiritual grounds that affected the society as a whole at the time, will be preceded by an analysis of some characteristic elements of the internationalist intellectual production regarding Soviet foreign policy and Marxism. Thirdly, conceived in the form of an epilogue, the final part of this essay does, in its turn, place itself in the early 60ies at a juncture when the ideological spiritual model previously dominant in the academy was gradually giving way to the implicitly conservative technocratic model that would prevail in that decade. Influenced by a growing domestic intellectual dissent, this period would witness a short-lived return by the Spanish doctrine to the history of the early 20th century that is epitomized in the launching of a scientific project under the title of Notes for the history of Spanish internationalist thought. Yet, despite this precious precedent, the contemporary Spanish international legal academy still suffers from what even the most sympathetic observer would term an Orpheus-like syndrome vis-à-vis its own international lego-historical doctrinal evolution in the 19th and 20th centuries."
"May 11, 2010","At the periphery of defence economics, where the discipline intersects with political science, lies the important analytical problem of terrorism and climate change. Whilst eco-terrorism has a relatively long history, it is the potential for what may be broadly termed 'climate change' to contribute not only to eco-terrorism but terrorism that is motivated by ideologies other than those of an ecological-political nature. An interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of this problem is required. The purpose of this paper is to provide the foundations for an economic analysis of the potential relationship between climate change and terrorism."
"May 11, 2010","This paper studies the incidence of political violence associated with the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. I take a cross-sectional approach where the unit of analysis is the district, and dependent variable is total killings by state and Maoists normalized by district population. I find no evidence that political and economic grievances are linked to the incidence of political violence. There is also very little evidence that district prosperity or political ideology are associated with the incidence of violence. On the other hand, I find that the intensity of violence was greatest in the Midwestern districts and in districts with low road density. Historical evidence suggests that the dummy variable for Midwestern districts that appears robust and significant reflects the political entrepreneurship of leftist leaders more than half a century ago. The results support a theory of conflict that treats an insurgency as analogous to a profit maximizing firm."

"May 10, 2010","How best to secure justice in the aftermath of mass atrocity? International criminal tribunals – and courtrooms and jailhouses generally – have emerged as influential accountability mechanisms.  Yet the justice pursued by international criminal tribunals, although tangible, also is strikingly under-inclusive. These limitations suggest that adequately redressing collective violence might contemplate a discursive shift to inclusively incorporating other accountability mechanisms, including collective forms of responsibility. Collective responsibility implies non-criminal sanctions that attach to groups whose misfeasance or nonfeasance is supportive of, acquiescent in, causally connected to, or necessary for serious violations of international criminal law to occur.  This paper examines what collective responsibility mechanisms might look like; what ends they might serve; what dangers they pose; and how they might contribute to a more robust instantiation of post-conflict justice."

"May 10, 2010","Does an expansion of the population size expose nation states to a higher risk of suffering from civil conflict? Obtaining empirical evidence for a causal relationship is difficult due to reverse effects and omitted variable bias. This article addresses causality issues by using randomly occurring drought as an instrumental variable to generate exogenous variation in population size for a panel of 37 Sub-Saharan countries over the period 1981–2004. Instrumental variable estimates yield that a 5% increase in population size raises the risk of civil conflict by around six percentage points."

"May 06, 2010","I examine enforcement and capacity building in international cooperation. In a game-theoretic model, a wealthy donor gives foreign aid in exchange for policy implementation by a poor recipient. The recipient has limited capacity to comply with international agreements, so the donor is not sure if cooperation failure is caused by willful disobedience or unintended error. I show that if perceived cooperation failure prompts reciprocal suspension of cooperation, the donor and recipient have a common preference for capacity building. But when the donor can request compensation for perceived cooperation failure, it only chooses to build capacity if cooperation is otherwise impossible. Consequently, the choice of enforcement mechanism shapes capacity building. This result lays a foundation for a genuine synthesis between the enforcement and managerialist schools of compliance. It generates falsifiable hypotheses and explains why reciprocal enforcement, which unfortunately inflicts collateral damage on the victim, is often considered legitimate."
"May 05, 2010","Conflict related displacement affects millions of families throughout the world. Very little is known about the determinants of health outcomes in the period immediately after a cease-fire is agreed, in which currently displaced people living in camps consider returning to their place of origin. In this paper, we study the effects of war and displacement on the health of children, using morbidity data collected as part of a large household survey from post-war northern Uganda in 2007. We combine this dataset with geo-coded conflict event data at the individual level to overcome the challenges of selection bias and endogeneity arising from households choosing their location in part based on their health status. This methodological concern is confirmed in our analysis. We then estimate the determinants of child morbidity (proxied by various health indicators) in an instrumental variables multivariate model, where conflict intensity at place of birth of the head of household is used as an instrument. We find that while children in IDP camps and in returnee locations exhibit the same mean morbidity rates, IDP camp residency almost doubles morbidity while poor access to safe drinking water in return locations counteracts the positive health effects of camp decongestion. Our results point to the importance of overcrowding and poor cooking technologies in IDP camps for worsening morbidity in children and the need to provide better sanitation and drinking water access in return locations to further improve the health status of conflict-affected children. Better data and analysis in early post-war periods can help to balance public health interventions, thereby strengthening the peace process."

In particular, the paper focusses on certain views expressed, prior to the Final Report, by senior members of the English judiciary in support of the wider use of mediation."
"May 03, 2010","Conventional international law contains various limitations on nuclear weapons, such as possession, testing, deployment, use or threat of use. There are a number of general principles of customary nature that could be considered as well with reference to the legality of these weapons of mass destruction. It is argued that given the current threats in the nuclear proliferation, a comprehensive abolition of nuclear weapons through international legal instruments is crucial. This article examines the jurisprudence of the International court of justice (ICJ) on the question of the legality of nuclear weapons in the light of progressive development of international law and recent state practice. It is suggested that modern technological and political developments in the area of nuclear weapons might be supportive of another advisory opinion by the ICJ that could enhance the debate on the comprehensive legal prohibition of nuclear weapons. Possible subject-matter to be included in a request to the ICJ to render an advisory opinion might be whether nuclear-weapon States fulfil their obligation and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to the comprehensive and effective abolition of these weapons of mass destruction. The article concludes that an appropriate framing of the request would reinforce the practical measures towards effective nuclear disarmament under the law. The ICJ could contribute to changing the whole concept of global and individual States’ security based on a comprehensive convention creating legal obligations for both states and non-states actors."
"May 03, 2010","The modern private military company (PMC) is a company that provides martial services through a corporate legal framework, and as such is the contemporary heir to private force providers of the past. This paper challenges the idea that modern PMCs operate in an alleged legal ‘vacuum’, and instead shows that there is a wide array of potentially applicable instruments. This paper addresses this patchwork of law primarily through the lens of mercenarism, first through proscribing international instruments followed subsequently by utilizing South Africa and the United Kingdom as the poles of their domestic counterpart responses. The rights and obligations of PMCs and its employees are then considered in the context of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law, and tentative steps are taken towards considering their liability for war crimes. An attempt is made to advocate for state responsibility of PMC actions to both control their operational excesses and encourage states to address the phenomenon in a unified fashion. At the same time, the paper acknowledges the fact that state responsibility is not the panacea as claimed by some commentators; an analysis of a case study involving the sale of the Indonesian military's services to private interest shows that the privatization of forces is more than simply about the form of its organizational structure. The paper concludes that the PMC activity should nevertheless be included within the state framework to utilize the strength of both International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law."
"May 03, 2010","By the very nature of treaties, States give up some of their sovereignty in order to achieve a common, desired objective between the parties to the treaty. When it comes to the Chemical Weapons Convention, however, commentators overly emphasize its impact on State sovereignty and equality without acknowledging the ways that it actually preserves State sovereignty and equality, arguably better than other multilateral treaties. This article seeks to bring balance to the debate by focussing on these relatively innovative and much overlooked provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, with the hope of encouraging the last seven non-member States to join and the rest to have even greater confidence in this most important of disarmament regimes."
"May 03, 2010","Under international ius ad bellum norms the use of force is always illegal, except when qualified as one of two exceptions: when authorized by a legitimate right of self-defence and when authorized by a relevant UN Security Council Resolution. The Iraq invasion of 2003 has been rationalized as lawful and authorized by a material breach of UNSC Resolution 1441. It is submitted that a breach of that Resolution is insufficient legal grounds for invasion. The Resolution is not explicit enough to warrant such construction and cannot claim to lift or abolish an existing state of cease-fire. It was for the UN not for individual states to decide whether Iraq had failed to fulfill its obligations to such an extent as to warrant punitive military action. The UN refused to take such action. The other argument presented in favour of the invasion's legality was preventive self-defence. Not only was that argument irrelevant, it was also an exercise in convolution - it asserted that legally under certain circumstances pre-emptive self-defence is the same as preventive self-defence. It clearly is not. The self-defence argument rested on two conclusions, subsequently proved false - the alleged weapons of mass destruction arsenal in the possession of Iraq and the alleged links between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. The invasion wasn't lawful under either of those two arguments. International law does need to adapt to new threats such as terrorist activity and cruel regimes, but not at the cost of making the whole system of ius ad bellum obsolete and dysfunctional."
"May 03, 2010","The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) is often considered to be a comparatively weak regime. It lacks several components regularly used to address other unconventional weapons (such as nuclear or chemical weapons). I argue that given the peculiarities of ensuring that biology is not used as a weapon, an alternative model might be better suited to strengthen international peace and security and to serve the needs of stakeholder communities. The first section of the paper identifies a set of ten characteristics desirable in any contemporary effort to tackle the potential hostile use of biology. The second section uses these characteristics to assess the utility of traditional arms control approaches. It then discusses how the BWC differs from existing models and characterizes current efforts under the BWC as an evolved networked model. Then I argue that a comparison with the identified desirable characteristics suggests, that in the case of biological weapons at least, an evolved networked model could offer additional benefits for international peace and security. The final section of the paper then examines, at a practical level, how the evolved networked model, as developed in the context of the BWC, meets specific needs of key stakeholder communities."
"May 03, 2010","On 28 July 2009, around 1000 Iraqi security personnel entered Camp Ashraf, the demilitarized camp of the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) in Iraq. Several PMOI members were killed and several hundred wounded. US forces had been surrounding the camp providing protection for seven years from the time they took control of the camp in 2003 until January 2009. During this period the United States repeatedly asserted that the camp's inhabitants were ‘protected persons’ under the Geneva Conventions, even though, in the view of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the conflict ceased to be international in nature on 28 June 2004. Amnesty International also issued public statements in 2008 and 2009, stating that the PMOI remained ‘protected persons’ under international humanitarian law. On 26 November 2009 the Audiencia Nacional of Spain also ruled that Ashraf residents are ‘protected persons’ under the Fourth Geneva Convention. This article explores the potential legal bases of these assertions. If there are sound bases for asserting the ‘protected person’ status of the PMOI after 28 June 2004, these may have implications beyond the political particularities of the United States’ relationship with Iran, to the benefit of other former ‘protected persons’ in the ongoing armed conflicts that have ceased to be formally international, in particular for refugees and for detainees."
"May 02, 2010","The ""opposing"" attempts to solve the armed conflict in northern Uganda have been viewed as Peace versus Justice. This difference reflects another perception of opposites: international (Western) law and (traditional) culture. Jurisprudence and anthropology would seem to represent opposing  poles in this drama. Nevertheless, if we see law as a target-oriented ""people's law"", these two branches of science would have much to offer to each other, being together able to create a reality in which global law and local understandings would both be able to promote glocal peace in a fruitful cooperation. A people's law would promote success and proactive responsibility in the contextual real world populated by human beings with human minds. In this law justice would not be the opposite of peace, but law would be able to promote peace. The challenge is to create de facto functioning measures."

"May 01, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the insights that might be generated into the nature of ‘lone wolf suicide terrorism’ through the application of mean-variance analysis. Orthodox approaches to the analysis of terrorism, particularly (standard) expected utility analysis and game theoretical analysis, may need to be extended or complemented with new approaches in order to generate analytical insights into lone wolf suicide terrorism. One such approach is mean-variance analysis. Commonly deployed in financial economics, mean-variance preference orderings with quadratic utility can be applied even when the mean expected return and variance are infinite. This fact might potentially be exploited to analyse, from an economic perspective, the behaviour of the lone wolf suicide terrorist for which success might be reasonably considered to generate an infinite expected return."

Moreover, what principles can be advanced in order to prevent anyone from using any means necessary, including torture, to extort information from those who are suspect of being in possession of such information that might save the lives of those who are dear to you and prevent the destruction of the world you like?"
"April 30, 2010","After September lIth. governments around the world have taken swift action to address what is now perceived as a world-wide threat of terrorism. The measures adopted are powerful and far-reaching. They also have the very real potential seriously to restrict civil rights and freedoms: the very rights and freedoms in the name of which the new anti-terrorism initiatives have been taken. While Courts have the power to ensure that these initiatives do not improperly infringe on individual rights and liberties. in recent judicial pronouncements. it appears that several high courts - specifically including the Supreme Court of Canada - are suggesting more, not less, judicial deference to government initiatives taken at this troubled time."
"April 28, 2010","Various concepts ascribe key roles to emerging non‐OECD countries in regional and global politics. This paper highlights how these concepts hint not only at a shift of global power but also at geopolitical regionalization: according to the theory of hegemonic stability, regional powers (a subcategory of emerging non‐OECD countries) are key actors in overcoming international anarchy and establishing cooperative and stable relations within their regions. Because of the different impacts of different regional powers, which are categorized in this paper using typologies of hegemony, the logic of international relations varies from one region to another. From a theoretical point of view, this means that international relations theories have to make region‐specific adaptations."
"April 28, 2010","This paper explores the use of hydrocarbon revenues in post‐conflict Algeria. While the bloody years of the 1990s now seem to be over, recurring terror attacks and the ongoing state of emergency leave room for doubt that a situation of stable peace has been achieved yet. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of post‐conflict peace‐building efforts in Algeria and identify ways of improving these measures. The resources, which are mainly controlled by the central state, can have positive and negative effects on the political economy: they can enhance growth and possibilities for the distribution of wealth, but the dependency on them makes the whole economy vulnerable to crises. Analysing the economic (and other) causes of the outbreak of the intra‐state war in 1992 and the reasons for its escalation and its fading out can be revealing when assessing the extent to which critical conditions have or have not been addressed by recent and current peace‐building efforts. The author’s analysis reveals that the measures taken by the government - such as implementing a programme of national reconciliation, the stimulation of certain sectors of the economy and the resolute reduction of foreign debt - all aim at stabilization and have all been driven by hydrocarbon income to a large extent. However, the recent rise and sudden drop in the price of oil and gas have both had an effect on the scope of these measures and reveal their limits. Moreover, some of the critical causes of the civil war such as the unfair distribution of revenue, the lack of political participation and destabilizing demographic changes still persist and have largely remained unaddressed. One of the author’s concluding assumptions therefore is that it is very likely that the use of resource revenues for conflict prevention and peace‐building will only lead to sustainable results when embedded in full‐fledged reforms of Algeria’s entire economic and political system."
"April 28, 2010","Religious elites are active for peace in many violent conflicts. Normative explanations often do not suffice to explain their engagement. In this paper we draw on the findings of social‐movement research to identify the factors that induce rationally acting religious elites to be active for peace. It is their relationships to the government, other religious elites, and believers that can motivate them to call for peace. However, they will do so only if they anticipate - based on the overall influence of other religious peace (co‐)activists, the structure of the religious community, and the frame environment - that they will not be penalized for their engagement. Religious norms are an important motivation behind religious peace activism, but rational decision‐making also has to be taken into account if religious engagement for peace is to be explained fully."
"April 27, 2010","In 2007, Professor Eric K. Yamamoto acknowledged that reparations theory and practice had reached a crossroads and called for a new strategic framework that reparations advocates could utilize in working to achieve redress for social and historical wrongs. My Article attempts to answer Yamamoto’s call. In it, I situate my proposal for a truth commission to redress the post-9/11 torture program in a new Inclusive Model for Social Healing. In the past, reparations advocates have relied on litigation – a model that excludes participants other than the named parties – to obtain redress. By increasing the number of stakeholders in a reparations scheme, the Inclusive Model of Social Healing has the potential to attract more widespread support from the public and is more resilient to criticism than exclusive litigation models."

"April 27, 2010","In reviewing the terms of the Balikatan joint military exercises each year, the Philippine government should negotiate a more equitable agreement with the United States. A fair and balanced agreement would require specific provisions detailing liability for potential environmental degradation as a result of the joint exercises. The current military activities in the Philippines will result in further damage to the environment. In order to achieve an equitable arrangement, the United States must admit that it has a responsibility to remedy the hazardous waste contamination at its former military bases in the Philippines. By reviewing past wrongs and the effect of ecological harm on the human inhabitants of the areas affected, both countries can move towards creating a new, mutually acceptable covenant, in conformity with international expectations of non-discrimination and equitable treatment. Three different sources of law are relevant to my analysis: international environmental law, Philippine domestic law, and U.S. federal environmental statutes."
"April 27, 2010","In 2000, the last year for Americans feeling comfortable and secure at home, the newly elected President George W. Bush promised Americans and the rest of the world that under his new administration he would promote bipartisan, peace, and mediation to address not just America's concerns, but the world's as well. Then 9/11 changed everything! Forever! President Bush would not only break all promises made pre 9/11, he and his administration would break the law on every level of government. From national laws in the U.S. Constitution that have governed America for more than two-hundred years to international conflict resolution laws that have lasted for more than a millennium, Mr. Bush violated them."
"April 27, 2010","The recent resurgence of international terrorism has imposed a difficult challenge on States where public power is democratically legitimated and where the rule of law prevails. Many States have created specific legal provisions, so called emergency laws, for the fight against contemporary terrorism giving extra powers to State bodies.  These laws intruding into the private spheres of individuals and their organizations were often based on obligations in international law. The anti-terrorism resolutions of the UN Security Council, while leaving considerable room for implementation on the State level, determined unquestionably the duties of States in the fight against global terrorism."
"April 27, 2010","This article identifies factors to determine the requisite legitimacy of a leader to allow a foreign country to conduct war in his State. In international law there are only three main ways for a State to legally use force: in self-defense, with United Nations Security Council approval, or consent. With respect to America’s war on terror, consent is often the only viable alternative. Using Afghanistan as an example, this article explores what happens when the leader providing consent is illegitimate and not really in control of their State."
"April 27, 2010","This essay examines empirically the effect of the Supreme Court’s 2008 judgment in Boumediene v. Bush, which held that detainees at the Guantánamo Naval Base in Cuba had a right to invoke federal court habeas jurisdiction. Boumediene marked a sharp temporal break because it introduced a new regime of constitutionally mandated habeas jurisdiction for non-citizens detained as “enemy combatants” at Guantánamo. The Boumediene Court envisaged habeas jurisdiction as serving a twofold purpose. First, it claimed habeas vindicates physical liberty interests in line with a longstanding historical understanding of the Writ. Second, the Court viewed habeas as a mechanism to generate or preserve legal boundaries on executive discretion. This essay gathers empirical evidence of the opinion’s effect up to January 2010 to determine whether these goals were fulfilled. While the data is in many respects ambiguous, it strongly suggests the effect of Boumediene on detention policy was not as significant as many believe. For example, less than four percent of releases from the Cuban base have followed a judicial order of release. Even in those cases, it is unclear if judicial action or something else caused release. Because the effects of habeas jurisdiction have been uncertain and perhaps marginal, effusive praise or blame of the Court’s 2008 decision is premature."
"April 26, 2010","In addition to raising doubts about the fairness and legitimacy of the U.S. detainee policies, torturing suspected terrorists poses the more immediate problem of, as former CIA chief of European operations Tyler Drumheller phrased it: “[w]hat are you going to do with these people?” If a detainee is prosecuted, the accused will argue that his confession and any corroborating evidence elicited through torture should be excluded. Consequently, CIA interrogators have little incentive to keep terror suspects alive after their intelligence value has been exhausted.  Moreover, a living victim of CIA interrogation methods is a prospective witness in the potential criminal prosecution of the CIA agent who performed the interrogation. The fear of prosecution for violating federal torture statutes is so real for CIA interrogators that many of them have purchased professional liability insurance to offset the costs of any legal fees associated with their criminal defense. For any agent, a tempting solution is “the disposal plan,” a euphemism for the extrajudicial killing of terror suspects."
"April 26, 2010","The essays selected and reproduced in this volume explore how international refugee law is dynamic and constantly evolving. From an instrument designed to protect mostly those civilians fleeing the worse excesses of World War II, the 1951 Refugee Convention has developed into a set of principles, customary rules, and values that are now firmly embedded in the human rights framework, and are applicable to a far broader range of refugees. In addition, international refugee law has been affected by international humanitarian law and international criminal law (and vice versa). Thus, there is a reinforcing dynamic in the development of these complementary areas of law. At the same time, in recent decades states have shown a renewed interest in managing migration, thereby raising issues of how to reconcile such interests with refugee protection principles. In addition, the emergence of concepts of participation and responsibility to protect promise to have an impact on international refugee law."
"April 26, 2010","The Article explores the use of the balancing metaphor/test by Justice O' Connor in the Hamdi case, and posits that the invocation of this metaphor had the effect of altering habeas procedure for Guantanamo detainees.  The Article explores the origins of balance in the law, and canvasses how our cognitive processes respond to metaphor.  I suggest that the powerful imagery of balance makes any analysis supported by the balancing metaphor more persuasive.  I further suggest that the use of the balancing metaphor is particularly inappropriate in the context of habeas corpus, because the Constitution and framers envisioned a process to be followed by the courts in those proceedings.  Using balancing as a methodology alters the procedural requirements of habeas."
"April 26, 2010","International law has generally been considered by the students of law as a subject with little practical relevance. However, the importance of international law in legal practice is increasingly being recognized in recent years. This may, in great measure, be attributed to the impact of globalization. Great strides in the field of commerce, technology and communication make one doubt whether transnational boundaries are going to disappear. Environmental concerns and human rights issues really transcend state borders and assume global dimensions. International law and international institutions have to play a dynamic role in response to the new challenges. In the current situation, the study of international law can no more remain uninspiring."
"April 25, 2010","It is impossible to think about democracy without elections. The litmus test of any electoral process in any country is the possibility of a one time minority to become a majority at another time and a peaceful transition of power. In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa though the multi-party elections appeared to be competitive they failed the acid test of democracy: peaceful regime change in a free and fair election. Failure to solve electoral disputes might lead to bloody electoral conflicts as witnessed in many emerging democracies in Africa. The aim of this paper is to investigate electoral conflicts in Africa since the end of the Cold War by using the 2005 post-election violence in Ethiopia as a case study. In Ethiopia, the coming to power of the EPRDF in 1991 marked the fall of the Derg dictatorial military government and the beginning of a multi-party democracy. The country held multi-party parliamentary elections in 1995, 2000, and 2005 where the ruling EPRDF party “won” the elections through violence, involving intimidation, manipulation, detentions of political opponents, torture, and political assassinations. The 2005 electoral violence was the worst electoral violence in the country’s political history that led to the death of 193 protestors and the imprisonment of more than 40,000 people. It is found out that the major causes of the 2005 Ethiopian election were the defeat of the ruling party in the election and its attempt to reverse the poll results by force; the Opposition’s lack of decisive leadership; the absence of independent courts and independent electoral management body; and the ruling party’s direct control over the army and police."
"April 25, 2010","Canadian mining in Guatemala has been associated with violence and death. Opposition to an INCO mine in the El Estor region in the 1960’s resulted in the assassination of two law professors, and another activist has been killed in 2009.  In the San Marcos region of Guatemala, two deaths are associated with the opening of a mine now owned by Goldcorp. Indigenous opposition to the mines continues in both regions. This article updates an article originally published in 2007which ties the events in Guatemala to efforts in Canada to hold Canadian mining companies accountable."
"April 25, 2010","The norm of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) has received increasing international attention in the last few years. In summary R2P refers to a concept that arose in the late 1990s in Canada which emphasizes the responsibility that governments and the international community have to protect their population. Thus, it is a concept that attempts to redefine sovereignty from its traditional basis on rights to one based on duties and responsibilities. The importance of the R2P as a concept is that it is an attempt to shape global governance at the highest level. Therefore, it is an example of policymaking at the global level and serves as a good case study on how a concept arises, can be transformed into a norm, and ultimately is institutionalized in international law. There is a final step which involves the operationalization of the norm and this is the stage in which R2P can be found at the moment."
"April 25, 2010","Ethiopia’s history has been marked by mutual respect and tolerance between Christianity and Islam, except a brief, but major conflict in the 16th century, and other minor incidents in the past ten years. The two main religions in Ethiopia, Orthodox Christianity and Islam have co-existed since the time of Prophet Mohammed. Christianity became the official religion of Ethiopia in the 4th Century A.D., and Islam had come to Ethiopia at the beginning of the 7th Century A.D., when a group of persecuted Muslims fled to northern Ethiopia from Arabia. The persecuted Muslims got a safe-haven in Christian Ethiopia and remained there until their country became peaceful enough to make their return possible. In the latter years, Ethiopia maintained its direct contact with the Muslim world through trade. Through time, many Muslim settlements emerged in Ethiopia, mainly along the trade routes. At present, Ethiopia’s population is almost equally divided between Christians and Muslims. Moreover, one of the holiest cities of Muslims, Harrar, is founded in the eastern part of Ethiopia."
"April 24, 2010","This article analyzes the incident of a bomb explosion on a Philippine Airlines plane in 1994. The accident investigation was able to trace the bomb compounds. A digital watch to timer explosion, a 9 volts regular battery, nitroglycerin (NG) and wires were set together creating the explosive device. To prevent accidents such as this one to happen again a research made among available explosive detectors system on the market today is presented. Computed tomography (CT) system and Backscatter Image system are found to be the best technologies for luggage and passengers screening, respectively. The role of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is also discussed. A TSO, the officer how performs the security check in U.S. airports, receives a short time training and has no expectative of career growing. The benefits and impacts of the employment to these systems at airports are also discussed. Facts such as shoes removal, throughout rate, radioactivity, privacy, and error on detection were found. Further investments on the training and challenging opportunities of professional growing are necessary to guarantee a TSO high quality security service."
"April 24, 2010","The scholarship on irredentism and secessionism suggests that the former is more likely to become violent and result in war than the latter. Irredentist conflicts are often instigated by sovereign states, whereas, secessionist conflicts are usually initiated by minority groups. Since sovereign states have military capability to fight full-scale wars, irredentist conflicts tend to be more violent and/or turn international. Given that minority groups lack military resources to fight for their causes, secessionist conflicts on the other hand normally do not escalate to interstate war. However, what happens if a sovereign state with a full-fledged army decides to support a secessionist cause? What if irredentist conflicts were instigated by groups who happened to be the minority, and not, the dominant majority inside a sovereign state? This paper argues that irredentist conflicts initiated by minorities are less likely to turn international and secessionist causes supported by sovereign states are more likely to result in interstate war. The argument is supported by evidence drawn from the Kashmiri, Kurdish and Basque conflicts."
"April 23, 2010","Access, brokerage, and efficiency are all acknowledged as important sources of political influence, but are seen as conceptually distinct. Yet all of them result from the distribution of ties (patterns of association) that link together actors in networks. These ties, whether material (like financial transactions) or social (like friendship), determine an actor’s ability to directly influence, make connections between, or quickly spread resources to, other actors. An actor’s relative position in a network formed by these ties thus provides an important source of influence over others. In this article, we introduce three classes of network centrality positions (degree, betweenness, and closeness), explain the advantages of each, and show that using centrality measures to measure how access, brokerage, and efficiency affect processes of socialization, domination, and diffusion in three important papers in the field of international politics results in more specific and robust findings in every case."

"April 23, 2010","The Article starts by investigating the manner in which the prohibition to use force is being incrementally corroded. In particular, it argues that the evanescence of the rule expressed in Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter does not stem from a conscious disregard for the prohibition on the use force since most States still feel constrained by it. Instead, it is submitted that the disintegration of the prohibition on the use force results from a general striving for looser limitations on that prohibition. This phenomenon is construed here as a liberalization of the use of force. Once it has been established how the prohibition on the use of force is being liberalized, only then this Article engages in a study of its consequences for the international legal order."

"April 23, 2010","The disclosure in 2004 of U.S. government legal memoranda seeking to justify the coercive interrogation of U.S.-held detainees raises important issues concerning the appropriate role and responsibilities of U.S. government attorneys, particularly when they advise on questions of international and U.S. foreign relations laws.  This editorial comment, written shortly thereafter by two members of the Board of Editors of the American Journal of International Law, each of whom has served both as an attorney in the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Legal Adviser and as an officer in the Judge Advocate Corps of the U.S. military forces, discusses whether the government attorneys preparing these memoranda can be regarded as having met the responsibilities of U.S. government attorneys involved in the “war on terror.”"
"April 23, 2010","The Spratly Islands conflict in the South China Sea originally started in the 1930s, but was first manifestly erupted in 1969. They are entirety and partially claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam, and Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei respectively. Spratly Islands is the source of conflict because of its oil abundance and other natural resources, and strategic location. Though some regional efforts have been implemented to resolve the conflict such as the preventive diplomacy and track two diplomacy employed by Indonesia, the track one diplomacy of ASEAN Regional Forum and so on, the conflict is still going on as all the claimants, particularly China, are realist in resolving the conflict. Since each claimant continues to do so, the interest/rights/power model or dispute resolution stairway is suggested. However, in order to rightly apply this model into Spratlys conflict, only two steps of stairway, interest-based and rights-based solutions, are taken into account. To put it in other word, two appropriate solutions, the interest-based solution or institutional approach - join development project - by employing constructivist theory, and achieving through negotiation among the parties themselves, and the rights-based solution or alternative dispute resolution approach - arbitration - conducted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) through UNCLOS, are proposed for the Spratlys conflict. Concerning the joint development project, it perhaps necessary to first negotiates a formal treaty that freezes the existing claims of all the disputants. The proposed treaty should also contain a clause that will enable Taiwan to unilaterally affirm that it supports and will abide by it. If all the claimants strictly adhere to the principles of the 2002-declaration and the to-be-created treaty, and the aforementioned are viable, further clashes can be prevented, and a way out for this protracted dispute can be merely achieved. Regarding the arbitration of the ICJ, the verdict of the ICJ is a zero-sum outcome. This solution might be viable if all the claimants could mutually agree with the verdict of the ICJ."
"April 21, 2010","By means of evidence-driven and declaratively implemented social simulation, we grow qawm – solidarity networks in Afghanistan. The study of qawm lends insight into the structural and processual dynamics of Afghan society. In particular, we concentrate on the evolution of power structures. An agent-based computational model is presented whose ontology borrows from neopatrimonialism, a notion of power prevalent in contemporary conflicts. In this model, agents' structural arrangement, behavior and cognition are informed by qualitative data derived from case studies on Afghanistan. The simulation results suggest that the emergence of qawm and, hence, the fragmentation of Afghan society are systemic and lead to a constant drain of resources. Cross-validation between the simulated network and a target system network reveals that qawm exhibit small world characteristics."
"April 21, 2010","The aim of this paper is to analyze to what extent different kind of immunities may bar legal proceedings instituted against PMSCs and their employees. The first part of the paper is devoted to the setting of the legal background on international law rules on immunity which may be applicable, in certain cases, to PMSCs and their employees. The second part of the paper addresses the issue of immunity of PMSCs employees from criminal jurisdiction taking into account existing case-law. The conclusion is that, in most cases, immunity of private contractors from criminal jurisdiction seems not to depend on the application of immunity rules but, for a large part, from the combination of a lack of applicable rules to exercise criminal jurisdiction and a lack of political will to proceed. As to civil proceedings, the most relevant obstacle that has prevented courts from exercising their jurisdiction over PMCSs and their employees (mainly in US case-law) is the so-called “political question doctrine”, that has been invoked in most relevant civil suits and has been accepted by some courts and rejected by some others. Such a doctrine (and similar ones) was crafted to protect the exercise of governmental functions and should be narrowly interpreted. In particular, there should be no bar on judicial review when international human rights law violations occur, since the governments themselves are bound to ensure respect for these rules and shall foster a culture of accountability for their officials and for private contractors they have decided to hire."

For this purpose, a time series method is used to analyse economic and social data through which different long-term coefficients are estimated in order to determine the effects of these variables on violence in Colombia from 1950 to 2006. Socioeconomic characteristics, poverty and variables associated with armed conflict affect the dynamics of violence, and moreover, there are various political variables that have a notable influence upon the determinants of violence in Colombia. More precisely, variables associated with a lack of state presence in some regions and educational aspects are determinant factors that influence the incidence of violence in the country."

"April 19, 2010","This paper investigates authorities’ relative counterterrorism effectiveness focusing on its behavior over time, its impact on casualties and property losses. Using data on transnational terrorism from the ITERATE database (1973–2003) and discrete choice models, relative counterterrorism effectiveness is evaluated controlling for a variety of terrorists’ and authorities’ effort attributes. The probability of a terrorist incident being stopped by the authorities has increased in the examined period. Furthermore, a negative relationship between authorities’ ability to stop an incident and the probabilities of casualties and damages is identified. However, the “ability to stop” exerts higher impact on the probability of property losses compared to casualties."
"April 19, 2010","Sociolegal scholars often approach dispute resolution from the perspective of the disputants, emphasizing how the resources on each side shape the course of conflict.  We suggest a different, “supply-side” perspective.  Focusing on the state’s efforts to establish centralized courts in place of local justice systems, we consider the strategies that a supplier of dispute resolving services uses to attract disputes for resolution.  We argue that state actors often attempt to “sell” centralized courts to potential litigants by insisting that the state’s services are more efficient and fair than local courts operating outside direct state control.  Moreover, we argue that state actors also invest significant energy in claiming that the local courts are incomprehensible.  Thus, in its efforts to introduce and advance centralized courts, the state argues not only that it offers the best version of what the citizenry wants, but also that it is impossible to conceive that people would want something other than what the state offers.  We illustrate our argument and explain its significance by examining judicial reform in New York, where there has been a decades-long effort to displace local justice systems."

"April 18, 2010","In this paper I examine the impact that the struggle against terror has had on free speech protections in three European states. Specifically, I argue that prosecutors have overbroadly interpreted and expanded the definition of laws designed to target individuals who provide material support to terrorists. As a result, some prosecutions undertaken by European states threaten to undermine the core democratic value of free speech.  By analyzing specific cases, I explore how some liberal democratic states have chosen to navigate the tension between security and liberty that Hannah Arendt referred to as the “crisis of authority.” Although I discuss each state’s relevant legislation, my primary focus is to draw distinctions and comparisons between the three countries based on recent cases that attempt to criminalize speech. This approach will allow me to assess the pulse of free speech in several democratic states that face significant terrorism threats."

We have so many examples like Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in which the U.S. and USSR agreed to no longer test nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space, etc. on which we can say that because of certain treaty and because of binding certain International Law, we can not drop a nuclear bomb on any of the nation whichever we want. I agree, that the importance of nuclear power have been increasing day by day and in future, only those nations will exist, those will be having a strong nuclear energy like U.S. But it also might happen that the nations who strictly following their International treaties like India will more powerful than U.S. because of strong participation in International treaties, strictly execution of International Law and of introduction as a peaceful nation in all over the world. Nuclear Power has possessed a gigantic History with some favorable as well as critical opinion of the various Nation."

"April 16, 2010","This essay traces a ""protection gap"" for terrorism suspects to a shift away from a concern with the reliability of confessions in the Supreme Court's post-""Miranda"" jurisprudence. It argues that in order to avoid results plainly inconsistent with the Court's earlier repudiation of torture almost 75 years ago in ""Brown v. Mississippi,"" notions of due process must be interpreted more broadly, consistent with ""Brown's"" recognition of an absolute prohibition on torture in our adversarial system."
"April 16, 2010","To say that it is difficult to divorce the debate over the suitability of trying terrorism suspects in the Article III courts from the politics of the moment would be an epic understatement. Especially in light of the Obama Administration’s decisions to (1) try the “9/11 defendants” in the civilian courts and (2) subject Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to civilian - rather than military - jurisdiction, recent months have witnessed a renewed barrage of objections to subjecting such extraordinary cases to the ordinary processes of our criminal justice system. These critiques have included claims that such trials make the city in which they occur a target for future attacks; that they provide the defendants with a platform from which to spew anti-American propaganda; that they risk publicly revealing information about intelligence sources and methods; that they are enormously costly both with regard to the security measures they require and the judicial resources they consume; and, most substantively, that they put pressure on the courts to sanction exceptional departures from procedural or evidentiary norms that will eventually become settled as the rule - what we might characterize as either a “distortion effect” or a “seepage problem.”"
"April 16, 2010","This essay, prepared as part of a Constitutional Commentary symposium on comparisons between the Bush and Obama Administrations' approaches to presidential power, highlights one area in which, both on and beneath the surface, there are disturbing similarities between the arguments of the Obama Administration and its predecessors vis-à-vis executive power: the proper role of the federal courts in detainee habeas cases."
"April 15, 2010","The role of economic factors in contributing to the initiation, prolongation or resolution of violent conflict has attracted increasing attention, as societies affected by resource conflicts are seen to pay an enormous price in terms of abuses committed against civilian populations, environmental degradation, destruction of traditional forms of social organization and lost developmental opportunities. The present paper sets out legislative and other tools that might be brought to bear in attempts to stem the flow of financial resources to belligerent groups and oppressive regimes. After briefly describing illicit conflict financing and the evolving international response to it, it sketches out a range of potentially-useful mechanisms based on international norms. These include counter-terrorism tools, and in particular the use of listing-procedures to bring counter-terrorist financing machinery to bear, as well as anti-money laundering mechanisms, including suspicious transaction reporting and ‘know your customer’ rules. Because the anti-money laundering system is based on the assumption that a ‘predicate offense’ has been committed, a summary discussion follows of how companies and business actors suspected of such underlying crimes might be prosecuted directly: the most relevant crimes being targeted sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council, organized crime and corruption offenses pursuant to the relevant UN conventions, and international atrocity crimes (war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity). The paper concludes with remarks on possible policy measures and action on the part of multilateral for and national governments in order to build upon the strengths of the system, to address its failings and to improve its future performance with respect to illicit conflict-financing."
"April 15, 2010","This article demonstrates how fine continuous and categorical measures of genocide intensity can be derived from the records of the Rwandan transitional justice system. The data, which include the number of genocide suspects and genocide survivors across 1484 administrative sectors, are highly skewed and contain a non-negligible number of outlying observations. After deriving nine proxies of genocide intensity from the data, various sets of these proxies are subjected to skewness-adjusted Robust Principal Component Analysis (ROBPCA), yielding four distinct continuous indices of genocide intensity. The effect of survival bias on these indices is reduced by augmenting the set of genocide proxies subjected to ROBPCA with the distance from an administrative sector to the nearest mass grave. Finally, the administrative sectors are divided into distinct categories of low, moderate and high genocide intensity by means of Local Indicators of Spatial Auto-Correlation (LISA) that allow identifying significant high-high and low-low clusters of genocide intensity."

"April 13, 2010","When do states attack or consider attacking nuclear infrastructure in non-nuclear weapons states? Despite the importance of this question, relatively little scholarly research has considered when and why countries target nuclear programs.  We argue that states are likely to attack or consider attacking nuclear facilities when they are highly threatened by a particular country’s acquisition of nuclear weapons.  Three factors increase the salience of the proliferation threat:  1) prior violent militarized conflict; 2) the presence of a highly autocratic proliferator; and 3) divergent foreign policy interests. We test these propositions using statistical analysis and a new data set on all instances when countries have struck or seriously considered striking other states’ nuclear infrastructure between 1941 and 2000.  Our findings lend support for our theory and very little support of the alternative explanations.  States are not deterred from attacking nuclear programs by the prospect of a military retaliation and concerns about international condemnation do not appear to influence the willingness to strike.  Ultimately, states are willing to accept substantial costs in attacking if they believe that a particular country’s acquisition of nuclear weapons poses a significant threat to their security."
"April 13, 2010","This article aims to apply Abulof's concept of ""small peoples"" to the case of the Muslim Malay Community in Southern Thailand. Existential uncertainty as an intersubjective reality is the defining characteristic of a ""small people."" Moreover, the article explores how the Muslim Malay community in the South of Thailand is facing ethnonational existential threats due to the assimilationist policies of the central government. The Patani-Malay language and the Islamic religion are threatened by policies favoring a homogenous national culture based on a unitary nation-state held together by the three pillars of nation, monarchy, and religion. Finally, the article concludes that one of the root causes of the Southern insurgency is the perceived slow death of the Patani-Malay ethnonationality by a significant number of traditional leaders and youths. Some ""soft"" approaches to deal with the intersubjective reality of existential uncertainty experienced by the Muslim Malay minority are also provided as tentative recommendations."
"April 13, 2010","Scholarly debates over the September 11th attacks focus predominantly on high-profile issues, such as torture, preventative detention, interrogation, privacy, and surveillance. These debates have overshadowed the equally important and far-reaching issue of terrorism risk insurance, which not only involves billions of dollars, but provides powerful incentives to keep us safe. Developing a sound understanding of the market for terrorism risk insurance is essential to guiding the difficult determination of the appropriate balance between private and public responsibility for preventing and (when necessary) compensating for terrorism."
"April 12, 2010","This article expands on the conventional discourse relating geographic factors – mountainous terrain and noncontiguous territory – to civil war onset. In addition to their direct effects on the strategic and tactical logic of insurgency, I argue these factors affect state capacity, as measured by tax capacity, and exert an indirect effect through this channel. Because tax capacity proxies bureaucratic and administrative capacity as well as material resources, it conditions the decision to rebel more than military capacity per se. Using fixed effect vector decomposition models, I find a negative relationship between both mountainous terrain and noncontiguous territory and state capacity. Subsequently, I find state capacity is strongly and negatively associated with civil war onset, though this relationship appears only with longer than conventional temporal lags. The cumulative (direct   indirect effect mediated by state capacity) of geography is anywhere from 22 to 59 percent larger than its direct effect."

"April 11, 2010","This report will provide a global analysis of the reasons why amnesty laws continue to be introduced, the diversity in the scope of these laws and their relationship to other post-conflict justice modalities. In analyzing the trends in amnesty law use, the report will draw from the extensive and up-to-date Amnesty Law Database created by the author to assess patterns across each region of the world. This database contains data on both well-known and neglected amnesty laws in all regions of the world, and at the time of writing had information on 506 amnesties in 130 countries from the end of the Second World War to January 2008.  However, for the case studies discussed below, the focus will be on post-conflict states where the amnesty issue is currently “active,” amnesties that have received little academic scrutiny, and amnesties that either explicitly include or exclude crimes under international law. The analysis of case studies will also include some examples where states have deliberately tried to enact laws that they argue are not amnesties although the effects are similar, such as the Justice and Peace Law 2005 in Colombia."
"April 10, 2010","Since the insurgency in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria became a national focal point, the need to tackle the problem  head-on has been recognized. This is considered crucial to Nigeria’s quest for meaningful development in view of her dependence on oil revenue. An unstable Niger Delta region translates into not only a lull in oil exploration and a corresponding  fall in oil revenue but also a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty in national consciousness. This paper discusses the all-important question of achieving security  in the region and adduces strategies for the attainment of peace and long-term stability."
"April 09, 2010","The Iran-Iraq war and the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (the ""1991 Gulf War"") provide vivid evidence that conflicts arising at least in part from disputes over natural resources can wreak remarkable abuse on the environment, whether it is attacked directly or suffers collateral damage.  International law seeks to limit environment damage in times of armed conflict not only because it may harm human beings, but also because ""dicatates of public conscience"" and principles in its own right."
"April 09, 2010","Terrorism has become an international concern and India is suffering from cross border as well as internal aggression from naxalites. The politics of vote bank as well as minorities allurement has made the governments defunct to combat this problems. The terrorism is a heinous crime and requires a tough stand to be eroded.Terrorism as the term itself denotes is used for an act which spreads the terror. It is very difficult to define as what exactly the terrorism is? The general notions about terrorism is that it is a kind of violent act intended to create massive sense of fear or terror through planned attack. Terrorism is not committed like any other criminal act mostly in isolation so that no evidence can be gathered but it requires the propaganda among the audience so that their motive is fulfilled. The terrorist act is done in planned manner under a technique developing with the development of technologies. The killings of innocents, kidnapping, hijacking planes, or any other coercive act that spreads the fear among general masses can be said to be terroristic activities.  In broader sense the terrorism can be described as use of violence when it’s most important result is not merely the physical and mental damage of the victim but the prolonged psychological effect it produces or has the potential of producing on the society as a whole and this paper analyzes Indian position which is fighting to curb terrorism and suggests some combating solutions."
"April 08, 2010","Over the past two decades the novelty of the proliferation of international criminal tribunals within the international community has increasingly attracted the attention of international lawyers. This paper explores the growing interaction between these international tribunals and non-state actors, with specific attention to the legal cooperation between the ICTY and NATO. The paper concludes that international criminal tribunals are increasingly claiming that their relationship with non-state actors should be premised on notions extremely similar to their relationship with states. Thus, the difference between states and non-state actors in this field appears to be blurring. Whether this trend will continue in the future, or will be opposed more vehemently by states, remains to be seen."
"April 07, 2010","Much ink has been spilled in the effort to dissect the causal link between democracy and terrorism and the results to this point are ambiguous about the degree to which democracy, or weak/strong government matters to the occurrence of terrorism. The state of the literature may require us to rethink the very nature of the relationship. Rather than think of terrorism as the product of particular regime types, it may be useful to think of terrorism as related to measures of state support and popularity. By turning to legitimacy as a core explanatory variable we can focus on terrorism as taking place in an environment where the mobilized political actors (governments and terrorist groups) vie for support from the people. This subtle shift in orientation focuses attention on terrorism as a dynamic behavior related to political struggles, rather than as a static outcome of particular formulation of government types. In order to assess this particular nexus on the cause of terrorism, this study evaluates rates of terrorism (yearly averages) derived from the Global Terrorism Database against Bruce Gillley’s (2006) measure of state legitimacy. We believe that when controlling for legitimacy, the data will bear out the hypothesis that the rates of terrorism a country experience is a function of legitimacy and not static characteristics of the state."
"April 07, 2010","Intercivilizational conflict has prospered in public and academic discourse since Samuel P. Huntington’s 1993 essay, “The Clash of Civilizations?” which gave new currency to a far older theme. It spread independent wings as fundamentalist Islam, and the fear thereof, peaked on and after September 11, 2001. This article offers several points of order. It examines the historical semantics of both “culture"" and “civilization,” tracing the conceptual tension between them in the history of European thought. Along the way, it dwells on philosophers, social theorists and novelists from the eighteenth century to the present. It then proposes a reconsideration of the early 19th-century distinction between culture and civilization, associating the merits and tensions of distinctiveness with the former and allotting universal values to the latter. Finally, it considers contemporary problems weighing on the useful distinction between - and desirable cohabitation of - cultural pluralism and civil universalism."
"April 07, 2010","Hong Kong studies often argues that 1997 - a key moment of globalization - marked not reunification and an end of colonialism but a “re-colonization” at the hands of Beijing. This essay refutes this claim on several grounds and  situates it in the context of global  knowledge production about China. China in general and even the government in particular enjoy significant, consistent popularity in Hong Kong. And when we interrogate the historiographic and cultural studies claims for a  re-colonization we see that this is more often announced than substantiated. The claim is intellectually problematic and, moreover indicates a continuing imbalance/contradiction dating from the colonial/Cold War era  in how knowledge about China, and the China-Hong Kong relationship is produced. Such work does not engage mainland perspectives and accounts but rather tends to “other” or orientalize the P.R.C. Globalization has not altered this academic/knowledge imbalance. But this may indeed be changing in the commercial and popular realms. This essay’s final section analyzes the emergence of a Hong Kong-P.R.C. hybrid identity as seen in the design work of G.O.D, a local chain  that sells home-goods, clothes, and the like with an avowed emphasis on both local and P.R.C. culture (e.g. Mao era things). All of this taken together suggests an end to the claim of re-colonization. Hong Kong has moved on and is now part of China’s globalization; the realm of knowledge production will eventually catch up."

This essay determines that Islam, after 1400 years, has yet to produce a full blown democracy or given any indication that it is capable of doing so.

"April 05, 2010","The year 2008 saw significant developments towards harnessing the institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights in Africa. More financial resources were allocated to the system. The African Commission and Court adopted interim Rules of Procedure which, by the end of the year, were still not harmonised to enable the Commission to submit its first case to the Court. The slow progress towards making the Court operational impedes the impact of the African human rights system. Another impediment is the inadequate response of AU policy organs to gross human rights violations, undemocratic rule, and the question of impunity. This article presents an overview of these developments."
"April 03, 2010","In this paper, we compare the EU’s and China’s anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia. For the EU, this is the first time it conducts a naval operation in the framework of its Common Security and Defence Policy. For China, it is the first time in half a century that it ventures into an out-of-area maritime operation. In terms of motivation, both the EU and China share not only important economic interests, but also aspirations of becoming global players in a multipolar world. Their operations serve both as an illustration of such aspirations, as well as a test case for future contingencies.  By contrast, the approaches adopted by both in implementing the operations reveal the divergence of their strategies. While China, despite the willingness to become a responsible international actor, is caught in its traditional notions of non-interference and sovereignty as well as logistical constraints, the EU shows leadership in putting into practice its comprehensive notion of security. Finally, the coordination between the two as well as other actors in the area reveals the wider geopolitical stakes at hand and the complexity of making optimal use of the presence of several “great powers”. We conclude that thus far the EU succeeded in integrating China in the multilateral framework without compromising its own position and ambitions."

"April 03, 2010","Since 9/11, academics and government officials alike have debated whether counterterrorism efforts fit into the laws of war, or are instead criminal law enforcement endeavors.  Each legal paradigm, in addition to the authorities granted to the intelligence community, brings with it specific powers and limitations.  This paper briefly surveys the legal authorities and implications for the targeted killings of terror suspects within each paradigm: the law of armed conflict, criminal law, and covert action, and argues for the justification of the practice within each.  It is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis, but rather serves to raise the key legal issues involved, and concludes by pointing out the policy aspects that ultimately drive whether and how we continue the practice."
"April 03, 2010","This essay reviews the literary legacy of Anna Politkovskaya (d. 2006).

Politkovskaia's work is further located within feminist anti-war perspectives."

"April 02, 2010","After examining  the similar goals and values that drive the simultaneous increase in international trials and the decrease in U.S. trials, the article then examines the challenges international adjudication poses to dealing with human rights violations and transitional justice situations. Simplistically, these tensions can be viewed as the need to strike a balance between peace and justice, top-down implementation and bottom-up impact, and process efficiency and conflict customization. The good news is that these challenges have been slowly working themselves out as the next generation of international adjudication models continues to improve.  This continued improvement and normalization leads to an even more interesting question - what are the possibilities for human rights adjudication in the future? What happens when countries and individuals are bargaining in the shadow of international law?  The last part of this article, looking through the lens of dispute resolution theory, addresses at least two intriguing developments that could occur in the next ten years. The first development might be the normalization of consensual international processes that mirror, at least to some degree, U.S. process.  After moving away from negotiation toward judicialization of international disputes, the pendulum might start to swing back toward negotiated settlements. Will individual defendants be more likely to plea bargain (as has already occurred)? Will states be willing to work out settlements with their human rights victims prior to trial? Given the potential risks involved in these developments, the international community needs to be vigilant so that the rule of law, rights, and equality are still protected through these consensual dispute resolution processes. Second, the shift to broad community reparations like health care and education ordered by tribunals and truth commissions opens up a new chapter in more appropriate remedies for human rights victims."
"April 02, 2010","Relations between China and the USA began with the best of intentions: the USA would sponsor the normalization of China’s status in the international community through trade in exchange for China’s commitment to peaceful co-existence with the west. As an emerging economy, China has relied upon trade for export-led economic growth, mimicking the path taken by its immediate neighbours over the past 25 years and the road taken previously by Germany and Japan.  For a variety of reasons, the original deal has been over-taken by the massive surge in Chinese exports to the USA, the tensions occasioned by the global financial crisis, and the sense in which the USA, as a debtor country, is now reliant upon China for its long-term future. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) is a product of the original deal and is emblematic of the new status of China in the global economy. As one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, the CIC has eschewed conventional portfolio investment in developed financial markets for strategic investment in resources and jurisdictions deemed essential to China’s long-term growth. As such, attempts to rein-in its ambitions through the Santiago Principles and the like have been circumvented by a very different approach to investment. The CIC is re-making the rules of engagement in global financial markets, thereby redrawing the nature and scope of the long-term relationship between the two superpowers of the twenty-first century: China and the USA."
"April 02, 2010","The author argues for replacing the traditional union/non-union dichotomy with a more dynamic, nuanced typology of employment relationships and for viewing the contemporary workplace as an organization with multiple distinct but interacting employment models. Such a framework has clear potential advantages for the public policy debate as well as for those making a strategic choice of employment relations models. Moreover, the framework benefits researchers who may use it to refine their empirical studies of the diverse forms and combinations of representation and voice in contemporary workplaces in order to determine which perform best in different settings for different work groups. The real alternative to union organization, the author suggests, is not ""no unions"" or lack of representation, but some innovative form of representation and voice. Whether these alternatives are sustainable and powerful enough to do the job remains an empirical question that the field should be tackling with greater clarity and vigor."
"April 02, 2010","In a recent book, Jonathan Zittrain shows how the government might use technology to “preempt” violations of criminal law and regulatory rules.   For example, the state might require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to illicit material like child pornography.   Such preemption differs markedly from traditional law enforcement methods, in which violations are punished after they occur.  Due to advances in technology and a shift towards anticipatory approaches for preventing harm, preemption is increasingly feasible and important."
"April 02, 2010","Despite its significance in everyday practices like powering a laptop or, writ large, in the workings of global geocapital, energy remains relatively invisible to anthropology. Perhaps guided by cultural ecology’s concern with energy as caloric ability, social scientists have so far attended to the ‘human aspects’ - or consumption - of fossil energy. They also document local environmental outcomes of carbon energy dependency and climate change. But the production of expertise and knowledge about energy remain under-examined, shrouded in what Laura Nader calls inevitability talk. In this paper, I suggest the potential for a critical ethnographic approach to energy by untangling some of the ontological and political conceptions that underpin intense local conflict over natural gas development in Alaska’s Yukon Flats Refuge. I ask, how does one study energy as an ethnographer? Theories of materiality have gained traction among scholars seeking to move beyond constructivist accounts of the nonhuman. Yet materiality doesn’t lend itself easily to a methodological approach. Tracing theories of materiality back to studies of the more-than-human ontology of aboriginal North American hunters provides me a practical starting point, suggesting that skill and experience in energy work also rests on ontologically significant ways of knowing energy. Knowledge about energy in the Yukon Flats reflects workers’ and activists’ everyday practices of producing natural gas as a physical substance and as a site of environmental protest. I argue that energy is conceptualized in culturally distinctive ways and that these conceptions are vigorously contested in the present conflict."
"April 01, 2010","Global warming is expected to contribute to many human wrongs: disease, malnutrition, flooding of coastal communities. But does every human wrong violate a human right? Should we conceptualize climate change not only as an environmental problem – the preeminent one of our time – but also as a human rights violation? Proposals to treat climate change as a human rights problem raise many fundamental questions. Theoretically, what does it mean to conceptualize climate change in human rights terms? How would a human rights approach differ from treating climate change as an environmental or economic or scientific problem? Descriptively, what does human rights law say about climate change and, conversely, what does climate change law say about human rights? Normatively, does it make sense to approach climate change as a human rights issue? What are the pros and cons? This brief introduction to a symposium issue of the Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law on climate change and human rights seeks to map out the overarching distinctions and questions."
"April 01, 2010","Currently, the United Nations is drafting an Arms Trade Treaty to impose strict controls on firearms and other weapons. In support of hasty adoption of the Treaty, a UN-related organization of Treaty supporters is has produced a report claiming that armed violence is responsible for 740,000 deaths annually. This Article carefully examines the claim. We find that the claim is based on dubious assumptions, cherry-picking data, and mathematical legerdemain which is inexplicably being withheld from the public. The refusal to disclose the mathematical calculations used to create the 740,000 factoid is itself cause for serious suspicion; our own calculations indicate that the 740,000 figure is far too high."
"April 01, 2010","Under pressure from the European Union and other donors, many efforts are undertaken by the Dam Authorities in Lesotho (Lesotho Highlands Development Authority) and the Lesotho government to put increasing responsibility on the dam-affected communities in regards to water management and maintenance of water systems as well as to create better channels of communication for conflict resolution. Although these efforts seem to be well intended, they often fail in their actual implementation. Therefore, there are several discontents on the side of the resettles and the relocates, which are the subject of (so far) non-violent conflicts on a local level. The changed situation where resettles suddenly have to pay for water and other basic needs is a second area of non-violent conflict. According to the people interviewed, the conflicts are basically between the authorities and the displaces, in rare cases between host communities and the displaced people. The third potential area of conflict is the fragmentation of the water sector within the government, which is tried to be overcome by the creation of the Water Commission to coordinate all efforts in the water sector. This fragmentation has of course implications for the communities on the local level. The report strongly argues for an implementation of an approach to increasingly involve the local communities not only in the implementation phase but also in the decision-making process in order to achieve greater effectiveness and sustainability of the water management in Lesotho. It finally suggests the introduction of a so called “Dam Council for Basotho Participation” (DCBP)."

Would holding the U.S. to higher standards than the Taliban, Iraqi insurgents, or the North Korean army yield an overall greater humanitarian welfare or be otherwise justified on the basis of international justice theories? Or would it instead be an unjustifiable attempt to curb American power, a form of dangerous ""lawfare”?"

Some of those severely injured sue the nation of Iran for their part in supporting Hamas, who carried out the bombing. Iran never makes a court appearance, so the plaintiffs win a default judgment for hundreds of millions of dollars. However, in trying to get some money out of Iran, the plaintiffs try to attach property in the United States, which may or may not be owned by Iran. Among the items of attached property are Persian antiquities that are suspected of being stolen, or at least improperly exported, from Persia in the 1930s by an American archaeologist, who later sold his findings to the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. The plaintiffs want this cultural property sold to the highest bidder to pay for their default judgment, but not everyone is happy with the idea. Not everyone believes that cultural property can be treated in this way - bought and sold like a regular commodity. Certainly, Iran, who finally entered the litigation, is not happy, but neither are the museums that currently hold the antiquities. What to do in this unhappy dilemma? The plaintiffs deserve the money they have been awarded to pay for their injuries. Terrorism must be stopped and its victims allowed recourse for their suffering. But not all would agree that the attachment of cultural property is a viable way to give terrorism victims relief. In the Rubin case, an important precedent is about to be set."
"April 01, 2010","American labour law is broken. As many as 60 percent of American workers would like to have a union, yet only 12 percent actually do. This is largely due to systematic employer interference, often in violation of existing laws. The Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), currently before Congress, contains provisions to rectify this problem. Canada's experience with similar provisions can be helpful in evaluating the arguments surrounding this act. It suggests that the reforms proposed in EFCA can be expected to safeguard rather than deny employees' free choices. They will not alter the balance of power in collective bargaining, but only help to ensure that workers can exercise their basic right to meaningful representation at work and, potentially, to win gains that could help to reduce inequality and return America to prosperity."

"March 31, 2010","Within its own borders, the European Union (EU) is certainly a peace project. However, its external security and stability imperative does not make it a peacebuilding project in the neighbourhood and beyond by default. The official EU institutions have political and conceptual limitations that prevent them from meaningfully engaging with and addressing state formation conflicts. This paper addresses the disconnect between the European Union and the civil society operating in the field of peacebuilding at the level of theories of change underlying policies, strategies and activities with the aim of transforming and resolving conflicts. Theories of change are elicited from the reflections and experiences of CSOs and from the main documents that concern conflicts and peacebuilding in the European Neighbourhood. It proposes a new framework for the forecast and assessment of the impact of CSOs on peacebuilding, which can be considered by the EU institutions for building strategic partnerships with international and local civil society to enhance conflict transformation in the European Neighbourhood."
"March 31, 2010","Despite numerous attempts over the past two decades – including most recently at the Copenhagen climate discussions in late 2009 – international forest and climate negotiations have failed to produce a legally binding treaty addressing global forest management activities. This failure is due in large part to a lack of U.S. leadership. Though participation of the U.S. in ongoing forest and climate negotiations is essential, the potential limiting effects of federalism on the U.S.’s treaty power in the area of forest management has not been fully explored. Such an exploration is necessary given the debate among constitutional law scholars regarding the scope of the treaty power, the history of the U.S. invoking federalism in order to inhibit treaty formation and participation, and the constitutional reservation of primary land use regulatory authority for state and local governments. This article argues that due to great uncertainty surrounding the question of whether federalism limits the federal government’s ability to enter into and implement a legally binding treaty directly regulating forest management activities via prescriptive mechanisms, voluntary, market-based mechanisms – like REDD, forest certification and ecosystem service transaction programs – should be included within any binding treaty aimed at forests in order to facilitate U.S. participation and avoid challenges to treaty implementation in the U.S."

Furthermore, by creating frameworks and legislation that protect the financial markets, terrorism becomes less harmful to the population."
"March 31, 2010","Mediating an international parental kidnapping dispute involving domestic violence allegations is certain to prove precarious, challenging, and controversial. Nonetheless, where the destination state involved in a dispute lacks legal or diplomatic parental kidnapping remedies, is non-compliant with international treaty obligations, or lacks effective domestic violence and child protection institutions, mediation may prove the only available mechanism to ensure an abducted child's safety and well-being, secure the child's return to a state that has effective protections, or facilitate appropriate access to both parents. Elective mediation can compensate for ineffectual remedies by affording system actors and parents an opportunity to build protective terms into a stipulated agreement and craft a safe, appropriate, cooperative co-parenting regime. Mediation may provide a domestic violence victim charged with international parental kidnapping an alternative to facing criminal prosecution, extradition and incarceration. The option to mediate a mutually agreeable solution could prevent a desperate, disenfranchised parent from taking unilateral actions that place the child, the parent and others at risk of grave harm. Denying any parent the choice of whether or not to mediate violates international laws and principles that guarantee all persons dignity, non-discrimination, gender equity, equality in the family, shared parenting rights and responsibilities, access to justice and equality before the law. Treating parental kidnapping as a domestic violence remedy, instead of treating domestic violence as a rebuttable affirmative defense to parental kidnapping, does injustice to left-behind parents, summarily deprives children of their right to access both parents, and undermines the rule of law."

"March 30, 2010","Citing empirical evidence drawn from an extensive survey of managers in the federal jurisdiction and in Ontario, Alberta, Nova Scotia and Manitoba, the authors report major shifts in the organization of work in Canadian government workplaces, marked by the widespread adoption of innovative practices. The same survey indicates that unions have had little involvement in the restructuring process, a fact which is attributable to the largely adversarial nature of labour-management relations in the 1990s, a highly centralized paradigm of collective bargaining, and the resistance of union leaders to change. As the authors note, however, attempts to introduce innovations are not sustainable without meaningful union participation. In the second part of the paper, the authors assess whether the recommendations of the Fryer Committee, if implemented, would foster the adoption of innovative practices and enhance the productivity of government workplaces. Many of the Committee’s proposals, in their view, are likely to eliminate unnecessary barriers to interaction between labour and management, promote cooperative problem-solving and communication, and streamline needlessly complex dispute-resolution and industrial relations procedures. The authors conclude, however, that the recommendations do not go far enough, and they are critical of the Committee’s failure to address concretely the government’s tendency to exploit its dual role as employer and legislator by interfering in collective bargaining disputes."

"March 29, 2010","The global economic downturn has ramifications not only at the international level, but also at the domestic level of politics. In developing states economic ills not only increase unemployment and contentious politics but also decrease state capacity to execute the rule of law. These three factors working together increase the likelihood of violence, crime and destabilization generally. In such situations collective actors often resort to the employment of private military forces. The concept of 'paramilitary force' is vague and at times highly subjective. The sparse literature on paramilitaries fails to capture the institutional variation found among these armed groups. Consequently, it has also failed to analyze how paramilitaries as institutions produce differing political outcomes. Employing theoretical models from peace/conflict studies as well as principle-agency theory, we argue for a new focus on properly conceptualizing what it means to label organizations as paramilitaries. We create four distinct categories of armed actors based on two dimensions: 1) the purpose and orientation of the armed group and 2) the security provision the armed group provides. The purpose of this paper is to call for an end to the conceptual stretching of the term paramilitary. In addition, the typology offered provides those in both scholarship and policymaking additional leverage on explaining the differing aims and components of armed groups."
"March 29, 2010","This paper is part of an on-going examination of constitutional inclusion of animal rights in Germany (2002) and Switzerland (1992, 2000), the only two industrialized nations to have done so. The previous phase of this examination explained how animal protectionists achieved this substantial gain through frame alignment processes, specifically frame-bridging, which mediated the interaction between activists and the political opportunity structures with which they dealt. This second phase examines the results of the two types of inclusion through a comparative study of case law since the amendments were enacted. The German constitution was amended to include a broad declaration that protection of the environment and the animals be a responsibility of the federal government, thereby granting animals equal protection against the constitutional rights of citizens, which was the major obstacle in prosecuting animal cruelty cases. In Switzerland, inclusion pertained only to a section establishing guidelines for gene technology, where there was a more extraordinary declaration that the dignity of creatures not be violated in research. What has been the effect of these two types of constitutional inclusion on animal cruelty cases? The hypothesis is that Switzerland's use of the concept, ""dignity"", pushed animals into an elevated status level so they are not judicially deliberated upon as owned objects, thereby providing increased legal leverage for their protection."
"March 29, 2010","In their co-authored chapter, “Acts of Sovereignty: The Aboriginal Tent Embassy and the Politics of Reconciliation in Australia,” Andrew Schaap and Paul Muldoon ask how the 1972 aboriginal tent “embassy” protests in Canberra inform our understanding of the “agonic relation of colonial governance vis-à-vis indigenous resistance” in Australia.  The claim to indigenous sovereignty, which activists insist was never ceded to the British crown, was enacted, Schaap and Muldoon argue, with the establishment of the “embassy” in front of the provisional Parliament House.  While a treaty, or “makarata,” with Aboriginal people was entertained by the government in the 1980s, a ten-year formal reconciliation process was instead announced in 1991.  This led to the reinstatement of the tent embassy by activists who opposed the reconciliation process as a betrayal of Aboriginal peoples’ right to self-determination.  In this context, the politics of reconciliation has widely been viewed by Aboriginal people as a nation-building exercise that evades the fundamental issues of Aboriginal self-determination, land rights, and reparations to the “stolen generations” (Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their families).  Schaap and Muldoon ask whether, despite this justified disenchantment with the formal reconciliation process, an emancipatory politics of reconciliation would be possible, which took the assertion of Aboriginal sovereignty enacted by the tent ambassadors as a “starting point for constituting anew the Australian polity.”  The paper does so by analyzing the extent to which the Prime Minister’s recent apology to Aboriginal people and the tent ambassador’s declaration of sovereignty can be understood as acts of constituent power."
"March 29, 2010","In her essay 'Agonism and the Power of Victim Testimony,' Sonali Chakravarti asks whether proponents of political agonism incorporate the most difficult emotions of war, including anger and despair in their political ontology.  Drawing on her ground breaking research in the experience of victim testimony, and especially truth commissions, Chakravarti argues that the rational models of criminal accountability and retributive justice cannot fully accommodate the expression of such 'unsocial' post-catastrophe emotions.  Drawing on the works of Bonnie Honig, Chantal Mouffe, and others, Chakravartiﾒs chapter examines 'what it would mean to fully confront the emotions of anger and despair after war in an agonistic way.'  In the end, Chakravarti gestures toward the possibility that victim testimony represents both a quintessential manifestation of agonistic democracy as well as its limits."
"March 29, 2010","The paper will reinterpret a certain kind of social choice problem characteristic of environmental dilemmas in accordance with Marx's notion of alienation, and use that reinterpretation to offer an alternative account of how such dilemmas are to be understood.  Hardin's 'tragedy of the commons' seems a plausible model for environmental problems; in it, a contradiction arises between individual preferences and social outcome, where the latter appears as an independent force over and against the wishes of those whose actions make it up.  This contradiction has exactly the structure the young Marx described as 'alienation.'  Hardin and others have argued that a solution would lie in privatizing the commons, thereby avoiding the problem of 'externalities.'  But externalities are the rule, not the exception, in social life.  Correctly understood, the tragedy reveals a problem with the very idea of the 'private' itself.  The tragedy is overcome only in an unalienated society whose acts are the product of democratic discourse in which social preferences are explicitly and self-consciously formed."
"March 29, 2010","The economic and national security of the United States is in part dependent upon the supply and price of fossil fuels, especially oil.  However, current efforts to promote alternative energy sources have so far produced very little in terms of actual energy production. Several technologies are in use (e.g. solar and wind), and many new, innovative technologies are in development.  All of these technologies are, in general, remarkably costly and therefore unlikely to offer a significant alternative in the next 10-15 years, unless significant policy changes are made.  This paper argues that the United States can begin to make more significant inroads into alternative energy sources only when it begins to correctly assess and price the risk of using conventional energy sources, and to make policy changes that reflect the true costs of these risks.  Currently many of the costs of conventional energy use are externalized -- in the form of war in Iraq, global warming, polluted air and water, and diminished public health."
"March 29, 2010","When environmental structures break down, new (self-)governance structures emerge from the pending chaos as a necessity.  Self-organization occurs as traditionally relied upon structures fail to provide the security, goods, and services necessary to fulfill basic needs.  Local organization emerges from immediate survival needs as individual ceases to be a viable option.  Working together to create tenable living circumstances, small groups emerge working together outside of traditional economic-political structures.  Looking at the governance situations devolving as a result of various regionalist and ecological changes, I reference historical examples of similar situations to evidence my hypothesis."
"March 29, 2010","This paper uses a quantitative analysis to investigate the decision-making process of the major arms suppliers, which also serves as a test of the traditional international relations paradigms. States cannot fight without arms, however, few states are capable of producing major weapons systems.  Supplier states do not have an unlimited supply of arms to sell or give away as aid, thus, a strategic decision-making process is present. During MIDs, suppliers must take into account their relationship to both sides of the conflict, which can complicate the decision-making process, depending on which paradigms assumption are used to determine the relationship."
"March 29, 2010","Despite an increased scholarly interest in Salvadoran politics, economy, and society since the resolution of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992, very little is known about the historical production of race and ethnicity, as well as these categories' relation to the state and the exercise of power in the country. Drawing from archival sources and ethnographic data, this project addresses the question of contemporary identity politics in El Salvador by examining its indigenous communities' present struggle for collective rights and formal state recognition within an increasingly transnational Salvadoran society and neoliberal economy. Thus, this project situates the current identity politics debate in El Salvador within the Salvadoran state's neoliberal economic reforms following the war period, moving from the regional to the national level of analysis. This study posits that  while increased regional and international economic integration made it expedient for the Salvadoran State to mythologize its Mesoamerican past and commodify 'Indianness', the State continues to deny collective rights to indigenous communities or to adopt a liberal multicultural model, since the ultra-right ARENA party, which held power since 1988 until March of 2009, remained committed to furthering the economic and political ends of El Salvador's hegemonic oligarchic class."

"March 29, 2010","Creating a dense grid of limitations upon the movement of Palestinians, fragmenting both space and population, the checkpoints are one of the most effective and devastating technologies of the Israeli occupation. Drawing on a foucauldian framework, we suggest that vexing interplays between bio-power, disciplinary power and sovereign power render these sites into a laboratory for new methods of control that no longer operate within the logic of normalizing regimes. This paper focuses on one mechanism operating within the checkpoints, one we term 'the imaginary line'. The imaginary line is a line drawn (metaphorically, in thin air) by soldiers at the checkpoint to delineate the permitted movement of Palestinians. Reading the imaginary line as an aberrant disciplinary technology (one to which a structural failure is embedded) we show how it serves to construct the Palestinians as failed products of a disciplinary process, thereby justifying the appearance of violence. The imaginary line is an emblem of a unique form of controlling space and the people within it: a form of control which operates not through regulation but through its interruption and which is dependent upon a high level of arbitrariness that seemingly undermines any effort of establishing a rule. The political system which thereby emerges is built on new assumed-relations between the ruling apparatuses and the ruled."
"March 29, 2010","This paper examines the shifting relationship between left-right ideology and Anti Americanism in France.  Neo-Gaullist episodes such as French opposition to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 have only underscored the weakness of anti-Americanism on the French right, as this policy was least popular among the supporters of the center right UMP, and found more support on the left.  Using data from party platforms, opinion surveys, and the speeches of political leaders, it traces the decline of right wing anti-Americanism in the French public, and the increasing alignment of anti-American attitudes with the left end of the left-right ideological dimension. This development is placed in the context of the increasing emphasis on neoliberal economic policy on the post-Gaullist right, and the use of the United States as a model for neoliberal economic policy."
"March 29, 2010","Through a comparative analysis of five Andean cases (Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia) I demonstrate that the conflicts and struggles over capitalist globalization in the Andes are intricately connected to the political power of the military in the region. I examine how conflicts over capitalist globalization in the five countries intersect with civil-military relations in the region, illustrating how the success or failure of neoliberal policy coalitions within these countries and U.S. democracy promotion has led to varying outcomes.  Neoliberal policy coalitions have successfully held power in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia over the last two decades, committing to the economic and political norms of capitalist globalization and low-intensity democratic institutions that include the weakening of military prerogatives. Similar coalitions have been frustrated in their efforts in Ecuador and Venezuela undermining this progress on military power and weakening U.S. influence."
"March 29, 2010","Following recent work by Vasquez and Valeriano (2010), I seek here to further disaggregate wars by type according to different factors that may have an impact on theory construction.  The goal of this work is to specify wars by type according to their properties so that one can seek to uncover the theoretical dimensions active in each war.  The quest for a universal theory of war onset must be discarded in favor of dividing wars according to the number of parties fighting, the issues they fight over, and the foreign policy practices they engage in.  This paper will seek to examine if the issue at stake and number of parties will determine if wars are fought among parties that have different ethnic, language, and civil components.  Can the internal attributes of states beyond regime type help explain the path to war?  Is there a certain class of war that typically determines when internal issues lead to conflict or are the internal dimensions of statehood important in the classification of war in the first place?"
"March 29, 2010","Strategies to prevent catastrophic climate change appear to conflict with solutions to the global food crisis. In the wake of financial turmoil, commodity speculation, the agro-fuel boom, and related food-price spikes in 2007-08, more than a billion people now face chronic hunger (FAO). Meanwhile, programs sponsored or proposed by the World Bank and international agencies would pay governments, landowners and farmers, especially in the tropics, to conserve and extend forests instead of planting food crops. Assumptions supporting this approach are that increased international food trade will supply hungry regions, that sales of the environmental service of carbon sequestration by forests will raise revenues for food imports and economic development, and that the intensification and spread of large-scale, modern agriculture will supplant peasant farming and produce more food. However, about a third of global greenhouse-gas emissions arise from agriculture itself and from related land-use changes. Large-scale, high-external-input crop and livestock operations and long-distance food transport are fossil-fuel dependent and contribute the greatest share of atmospheric and water pollution from agriculture. A growing body of evidence points to a more promising alternative. Diversity-based, low-external-input agriculture, drawing on agro-ecological science and local farmer knowledge, is often equally or more food-productive and nutritious than industrial monocrop agriculture. Diversity-based smallholder agriculture and silviculture can be much less environmentally destructive and have at least equal ability, compared to industrial farming, to sequester carbon in vegetation and soils. This approach, combined with policies to strengthen food production for local, national, and regional needs, has the additional advantages of supporting local cultures and livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to externally-caused food-price shocks and shortages. The concept of food sovereignty provides the principles and policy guidelines for promoting this strategy."
"March 29, 2010","This paper will empirically examine whether the existence of strong enforcement mechanisms in international human rights treaties influences state commitment decisions. In particular, I look at whether state decisions to commit to the International Criminal Court -- which has strong enforcement mechanisms -- differ from state decisions to commit to other international human rights treaties -- which typically only require a state to self-report its level of compliance with treaty terms.  I expect states will view the strong enforcement mechanisms of the International Criminal Court and its provision for an independent prosecutor who can prosecute state nationals who commit mass atrocities as a credible threat and will only commit if they intend to comply with treaty terms.  On the other hand, I expect states to commit to international human rights treaties without strong enforcement mechanisms without regard for their ability and willingness to comply with treaty terms that promote good human rights practices.  If states do not commit to treaties with strong enforcement mechanisms unless they intend to comply, the implication is that treaties with such provisions might be more effective at improving human rights practices and curbing atrocities."
"March 29, 2010","Public participation has emerged as the dominant paradigm for balancing social and political factors with the need for technically sound decisions in environmental policymaking. Participation can, according to proponents, produce robust policy outcomes by incorporating community needs, desires, and knowledge in the decisionmaking process. However, it is still unclear how and to what extent participation influences communities as a whole.This research project applies community empowerment theory to public participation in voluntary brownfield cleanup projects in the East Bay region of northern California. Empowerment theory holds that public participation benefits communities by strengthening social networks, making technical knowledge more available to community members, and by giving communities leverage over the political process. The concept of empowerment thus offers a perspective for understanding the broader social effects of participation. Several case studies were selected among brownfield sites in Alameda and western Contra Costa Counties, areas that are ethnically and economically diverse and have a long history of urbanization and industrial development. Based in past research, the project develops a set of indicators of empowerment. These indicators were then used to code the data from each case study, including public comments, transcripts of community meetings, and transcripts of interviews with public participation specialists and community members. A broader question embedded in this research is whether participation in a technical, agency-dominated process can be empowering for communities, or whether such participation is limited to documenting approval or disapproval of policy outcomes."
"March 29, 2010","In recent years, abortion has become a salient issue in Mexican politics. In this study, we intend to use data from the World Values Surveys to acertain the correlates of attitudes toward abortion among Mexican mass publics. We will examine the effects of attitudinal variables (respect for life, attitudes toward sexual morality, feminism, ideology), religious variables (Catholicism, doctrinal orthodoxy, church attendance) demographic variables (gender, age, education, female labor force participation) and region. We estimate models with ordered logistic regression, while controlling for regional effects and other influences on attitudes."
"March 29, 2010","This paper proposes an integrated crisis management and resolution framework for the EU's single banking market. It comprises a European Resolution Authority (ERA), armed with the mandate and the tools to deal cost-effectively with failing systemic cross-border banks, and is designed to address many fundamental operational and incentive problems. It also seeks to reduce moral hazard and better protect countries against the risk of twin fiscal-financial crises by detaching banks from government budgets. The ERA would be most effective if it were twinned or combined with a European Deposit Insurance and Resolution Fund."
"March 29, 2010","Crisis creates obstacles, but also opportunities.  In the economic restructuring that follows recent global events, we may see significant changes in the organization of workers, workplaces, and work itself -- which makes this a crucial time for advancing and evaluating visions of just work.  This paper explores contrasting visions of justice through the lens of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which entitles workers with medically documented disabilities to reasonable accommodation in their workplaces, subject to workers' abilities to perform the essential functions of their positions.  I argue that such provisions are exemplary of law's operation as aterrain of conflict between the powerful and powerless, here mingling, on the one hand, a vision of radical reform for both people with disabilities and workers more generally, and on the other, a reiteration of the marginality and subordination of both groups, compounding these at the groups' intersection.  I conclude by putting forth an alternative vision of justice, one which draws on the most promising elements of the ADA framework as a model for worker empowerment and workplace diversity broadly understood, while seeking to avoid the shortcomings of that framework through a refiguring of the worker and a reconceptualization of diversity."
"March 29, 2010","We investigate whether democratic aid flows, which are directed toward the democratization of recipients by covering democracy-related programs and government and civil society activities, affect the future political regime of recipient countries. We introduce a multinomial multivariate logit model and we use 5-yr averaged data covering the period 1972–2004 for 59 democracy aid-recipient countries categorized into three broad classes according to the prevalent political regime. We find strong evidence that democratic aid flows are positively associated with the likelihood of observing a partly democratic or a fully democratic political regime in democratic aid-recipient countries and that this result is robust to the potential endogeneity of democratic assistance."
"March 29, 2010","The prevalence of intrastate violence in Africa makes understanding the sources of instability particularly important to conflict prevention. Why is civil violence more common in Africa? What causes African countries to be more politically unstable? Recent research on civil conflict has increasingly incorporated measures of ethnic pluralism to account for variation in levels of political violence. This work has generated a debate about whether and how ethnic pluralism matters. Easterly and Levine (1997), for example, argue that higher levels of ethnic diversity encourage instability. Collier (2000) instead finds that the likelihood of civil unrest decreases at high levels of ethnic diversity.  Englebert (2000) contends that as the result of their simplistic view of ethnic identity and the empirical fragility of the indices they use, theories of ethnic fractionalization fail to explain why some countries are more prone to political violence than others. In this paper, I conduct my own study of the effects of ethnic diversity on events of political instability. I examine whether the empirical shortcomings of current measures of ethnic diversity do in fact detract from the explanatory power of the variable or whether ethnic heterogeneity can determine the likelihood of civil unrest. My goal is to systematically expand on Englebert's hypothesis that ethnic heterogeneity is a weak predictor of economic stagnation in Africa and test how well ethnic pluralism predicts civil unrest."
"March 29, 2010","There has been an array of studies on the effect of economic liberalization on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to the developing world.  Still more have focused on whether countries decrease government services, as well as labor and environmental standards, in order to attract investment.  In both areas, scholars have examined aggregate levels of FDI.  This is a mistake that has led to widely varying and even contradictory findings.  In this paper we reconsider these analyses by disaggregating FDI by its destinations in manufacturing, service, and primary resource sectors.  We expect, for example, that liberalization will have a greater positive effect on FDI in the manufacturing sector than in natural resources, many of which are attractive regardless of policy barriers.  Similarly, we anticipate that investors seeking low-wage manufacturing opportunities will have more leverage vis-à-vis the government in extracting lower taxes and less regulation than those entering the service sector.  This is because the former can concentrate in a few countries with the attractive policies while a single country’s service sector is either tapped or untapped by investors.  We test our expectations using cross-sectional time series data from 15 Latin American countries between 1985 and 2006.  Preliminary results strongly suggest the utility of our approach."
"March 29, 2010","As global threats surrounding climate change issues continue to surface at the forefront of political debate, state governments across the country are initiating a variety of programs to incentivize improving energy efficiency in residential households. Yet, when considering the possibilities for transforming residential households to more energy efficient spaces, it becomes apparent that not all households have the same opportunities to improve energy efficiency. This paper will illustrate this inequity by identifying the different opportunities for improving energy efficiency that Pennsylvania energy efficiency loans, incentives and rebate programs make available. Preliminary research on this topic suggests that not all residential households have equal opportunities for improving energy efficiency. Consequently, the benefits resulting from such improvements are not distributed equally among all residents. This paper will argue that justice requires a more equal distribution of opportunities to improve energy efficiency. Although theories of justice do not normally treat opportunities for improving energy efficiency as the subject of justice, my argument will rely on the basic idea that in a liberal democratic society, justice requires that government policies treat the interests of all people equally. This paper will demonstrate how this idea can guide and inform practical steps to create a more just energy efficiency program in Pennsylvania."
"March 29, 2010","Does foreign aid promote or reduce civil unrest in recipient countries?  While a significant body of research has tested examined the relationship between aid and the likelihood of civil war in recipient countries, there has been little discussion of the effects of foreign aid when considering foreign aidﾒs effect on other less violent forms of civil strife is understudied. We consider, and empirically test, two competing theories regarding the effect of aid on civil unrest. The results of our tobit analyses on 99 countries from 1961 through 2004 of aid on three indicators of unrest indicate that increased inflows of foreign aid actually reduces the instance incidence of civil unrest, in particular, demonstrations, general strikes, and riots. Though these findings suggest that aid may be beneficial by reducing unrest in recipient countries, this implication is contingent upon the causal mechanism linking aid to stability."
"March 29, 2010","These Remarks were presented to a local women's conference in Northern Ireland. They consider how UNSC Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security might be utilized by women attempting to influence official processes to deal with the past in Northern Ireland. In the Remarks, two aspects of the Resolution are considered, namely the protection of women as victims of violence, and the participation of women in peacemaking. The commentator suggests that, to date, interventions from Northern Irish women into official processes to deal with the past have concentrated on the participation aspect of the Resolution. Drawing on international experience of feminist engagement with transitional justice, the Remarks contend that women in Northern Ireland would do well to focus greater energy and attention on the protection aspect of the Resolution, articulating more fully and comprehensively the diverse forms of violence to which women were subjected during the conflict, and demanding accountability for that violence. In this way, UNSC Resolution 1325 might facilitate a conversation that has long proven difficult and divisive amongst women in Northern Ireland on the nature and extent of the gender-specific impact of the conflict violence, and ultimately, provide a platform to influence official conversations about dealing with the past in Northern Ireland."
"March 29, 2010","As the world as become more globalized and North America has become more integrated through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States and Mexico have an increasingly common interest in security issues. The stability of Mexico is a primary security concern for the U.S. since Mexico is the one the U.S.' biggest trading partners and importers of petroleum. The border between the two, however, has long created a problem for the U.S. due to narotics trafficking and alien smuggling. The terrorist attacks of September 11 have led to increasing awareness by the U.S. of the possibility of an international terrorist threat stemming from the border. We argue that despite political will by elites on both sides, and security agreements and arrangements such as, the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) agreement, and the U.S.-Mexican Border partnership agreement, joint security interests are hindered by a variety of factors. These factors include asymmetric security interests, a weak border security regime, and inadequate domestic institutions in Mexico. The result is that current cooperation between the two states is insufficient to protect against mutual threats to their security."
"March 29, 2010","Previous agent based models have shown how, despite the tendency of cultures to converge and cultural traits to spread, differences between social groups can become more - not less - accentuated over time.  Local cultural convergence can cause global cultural polarization in relatively short order.  In the real world, however, cultural diffusion is inextricably linked to the ability of different cultures to interact and communicate freely across space - something that cannot always be taken for granted.  Geographic boundaries (such as mountains and deserts) can limit diffusion and change the process of cultural interaction.  Adapting a well-known agent based model of cultural dissemination (Axelrod 1997), this paper examines how physical barriers can influence cultural convergence."
"March 29, 2010","The mutually-constitutive relationship between ideas, institutions, and material structures is an ongoing concern of Critical and Neo-Gramscian IPE Theory.  In this paper, I propose that the current global economic crisis, and the international institutional response, may illustrate the central role of economic crisis as the material basis of the internationalization of hegemonic control.  The institutional responses to the crisis of this decade may be understood as the mechanism by which hegemonic conception of the world is reproduced and extended internationally and provides us with the link between Gramsciﾒs  notion of national state hegemony and the Neo-Gramscian  internationalization of that concept.  In the end I propose that the crisis of the neoliberal world order may function for the extension of global hegemony much in the same was as did the collapse of Keynesian embedded liberalism at the end of the Bretton Woods era; deepening global hegemony and leading us to an international ideological system increasingly congruent with the national system describe by Gramsci himself."
"March 29, 2010","The most significant changes to the practices and institutions of global governance have historically been in response to crises. The breakdown of international order in the 1930s led to the creation of the UN system; the present global financial crisis and recession, in a similar fashion, has produced calls for another remaking of inherited modes of global governance. This paper examines the relationship between the international politics of crisis and the generation of new forms of knowledge and new practices concerning global governance. To that end, it will focus on the crisis faced by the post-war institutions of governance in the late 1960s and early 1970s, brought about by the breakdown of financial order, economic recession, lagging development in the global South, growing concern about the environment, and geopolitical tensions caused by shifts in the balance of political, military and economic power. It addresses the responses advocated to these developments by policymakers and the relevant epistemic communities, and the responses that were implemented, from the creation of great power co-ordination mechanisms like G7 (founded in 1975) to the inception of global networks of environmental activists. In conclusion, the paper will consider the lessons this phase in the development of contemporary modes of global governance might have for the present crisis."
"March 29, 2010","This paper explores temporal variation in partisan effects on social spending growth in OECD countries over the period 1971-2002. We argue that partisan effects are jointly conditioned by globalization and the mobilizational capacity of organized labour. We present three main empirical findings. First, we show that partisan effects increased from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s and then disappeared in the 1990s. Second, we show that partisan effects rose with globalization in the 1970s and early 1980s, a period characterized by rising labour strength in many OECD countries, but this is not true for the post-1990 period, characterized by declining labour strength. Third, we show that globalization was associated with declining partisan effects in countries that experienced union decline in the 1980s and 1990s, but it was associated with rising partisan effects in countries in which unions remained strong."

"March 29, 2010","Periods of political violence and instability are inimical to statesﾒ development and often a drain on the resources of the international community, yet we have only a partial understanding of the factors underlying, and potentially mitigating, such instability.  I argue that varying levels of governmental transparency better explain and predict political stability and absence of violence than prevailing theories focusing on wealth inequality (Posner 1997) or ethno-linguistic fractionalization (Fearon, Kasara, and Laitin 2007).  When government processes are transparent, officials have greater incentives to put public benefit ahead of narrower interests, and citizensﾒ confidence in government expands.  I test this theory by modeling wealth inequality and ethno-linguistic fractionalization alongside two proxies for transparency, and find that increased transparency is strongly associated with higher levels of political stability.  Meanwhile, the explanatory potential of wealth inequality and ethno-linguistic fractionalization fades to insignificance in the full model.  I also run software simulations that sample from computed distributions of the independent variables to confirm the superiority of transparency indicators.  My findings suggest that governmental transparency is a necessary condition for political stability in many contexts, and may be even more critical under conditions of significant wealth inequality or ethno-linguistic fractionalization."
"March 29, 2010","This study considers prospects for the revitalization of social norms after ethnic conflict in the case of post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina. Between September 2003 and January 2004, a total of 681 subjects took part in a survey and a series of behavioral decision-making experiments across Bosnia. Using variations on the classic dictator game, the study shows how perceptions of a norm of fairness are impacted by ethnic treatments. Contrary to assumptions of ethnic polarization and hatred, the study reveals the persistence of a norm of fairness across ethnicity in Bosnia and points to the utility of experimental methods in the study of ethnic conflict."
"March 29, 2010","This paper will examine two influential understandings of the politics of human rights. Liberal pragmatism, exemplified by Michael Ignatieff, holds that while we cannot agree on what is good, we can agree on what is evil.  commitment to human rights should be grounded on an understanding of the perils of state power. Human rights are political, not metaphysical, to the extent that they are based on this pragmatism rather than some agreed conception of what it is to be human. The radical tradition, exemplified by Marx, views human rights as inherently ideological since the formal equality that they represent masks the reality of social domination. Human rights are political to the extent that they are complicit in getting people to accept their domination. Through a close reading of Paul Ricoeur's essay, ""The Political Paradox"", I show how the concept of the political reveals the inadequacy of both of these understandings. Against the pragmatist apology, the politics of human rights always presupposes some conception of the political and is therefore always bound up with the organization of power and the regulation of social life, rather than simply protecting individuals from state power. Against the radical critique, the politics of human rights never simply consists in their being ideological. Their ideal aspect is never purely a mask for social power but always also potentially provides a symbolic resource for a politics of struggle against domination."
"March 29, 2010","In my paper I argue humanitarian intervention is like imperial intervention in that it continues to perpetuate an oppressive economic system because humanitarians fail to address the systemic issues (namely the capitalist system) that cause these crises in the first place. My exploration of humanitarianism begins with a theoretical discussion of the Gramscian perspective. His analysis of social relationships helps us to understand why it is that the humanitarians can be non-state actors with a focus on human rights but can still support policies that strengthen the elite interest. Second, I focus on imperialism. Many people talk of an epoch of imperialism that ended in the 1970s. We can certainly talk of a formal imperialist era. However, the imperialist structure if an earlier time in international relations still exists. Next I look at how humanitarianism is like imperialism. After all, there are no more Andrew Jacksons or King Leopolds, therefore, a comparison of humanitarianism and imperialism deserves qualification. Lastly, I end my paper with a what is to be done discussion. In this section I engage in a conversation about the human rights (ideas which undoubtedly drive humanitarian action) and whether it is desirable to abandon universal human rights norms altogether."
"March 29, 2010","This paper examines the challenges that Indigenous peoples face when they use cultural rights arguments to influence the decision making of international organizations such as the United Nations, the WTO and NAFTA regulatory boards. The paper responds to the concerns that identity politics has anti-democratic tendencies and that it leads to counterproductive outcomes for Indigenous peoples. But it also challenges the position that the international arena offers a different and more hopeful context than the nation-state for indigenous peoples to advance their agendas."
"March 29, 2010","The majority of studies investigating the determinants of public support for international economic and political integration have primarily focused on citizen attitudes in European Union member-states and candidate countries. This body of research has found, by and large, that the intensity of an individual’s sense of national and supranational identity has an effect on levels of support for the European Union.  Yet, these studies were also conducted at a time when European integration was tangible and when a larger European identity was already generally salient. We seek to expand the debate on the role of identity in support for integrative policies by examining attitudes on integration in North America - a region with a much less salient sense of supranationalism and a far less extensive integration project. In addition to providing a comparative perspective to the identity-support question, this paper further contributes to the present literature by investigating whether or not the priming of such locality-based identities result in increased or decreased support for integration. Results from an estimation of World Values Survey data for all three North American countries, as well as an original experimental study conducted in the US and Mexico, lend support to the argument that national and supranational identity plays a role in citizen attitudes toward integration. In addition, while we find considerable support for the hypothesis that manipulating the salience of these identities impacts individual support for integration, we also uncover clear cross-national differences in North American attitudes and offer our thoughts on why these differences might exist."
"March 29, 2010","Freshwater is a critical natural resource, and management of transboundary freshwater resources is a particularly difficult task for riparians.  As observers of water politics, however, we lack a metric to classify and compare the severity of these  transboundary freshwater conflicts.  Is a military confrontation more likely to happen between Israel and Jordan over the Jordan River, or between India and Pakistan over the Chenab?  Is more likely that China will use force over access to the Mekong, or Namibia over the Kunene?  This paper develops and tests a metric of severity using environmental, political, and economic data from over two hundred transboundary rivers, lakes, and aquifers."
"March 29, 2010","Subsystems, or networks, populate the international system of states. Occassionally, a subsystem collapses and the constituent states become free agents with respect to the remaining subsystems. If we consider what the free agents want of a new subsystem as well as what the subsystems desire to gain by adding additional members, then we should expect that only the strongest free agents, excluding the former nexus power, will be drafted into the extant subsystems and, consequently, that former nexus powers will attempt to reconstitute a new subsystem from among the residual states. In this paper, I thoroughly expand on this process of systemic change and derive observable implications that I test with new data on subsystem membership. Results help to explain the puzzle of why systemic leadership has remained relatively exclusive to a few states despite the vast proliferation of states over time and space."
"March 29, 2010","Whether viewed as advocating on behalf of “special interests” or the broader “public interest,” interest groups play a central role in modern politics. But theories of pluralism presume that, so long as interest groups have access to participate in the political process, the outcome of the process is, democratically-speaking, good.  Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920), a Dutch journalist, politician, and theologian, proposed the concepts of “sphere sovereignty” and “public justice” to delineate the proper function and scope of government in relation to other non-governmental institutions (e.g. families, churches, civic associations), and insisted that different institutions in society exercise governance (i.e. sovereignty) over their respective spheres of responsibility."
"March 29, 2010","Research question of the paper is what factors lead to third-party intervention in civil wars by both major and minor powers. For this purpose, I propose that we consider four dimensions of civil war intervention. The first dimension to consider is the civil war itself. The characteristics of civil war are assumed to have some impact on a third partyﾒs decision regarding intervention. Second, the characteristics of intervening states should be considered. Their domestic politics, including institutional settings, should be taken into account if we want to see how their decisions regarding intervention are made. Third, the relationship between the host country and the intervening country needs to be analyzed. Their formal alliances and ethnic ties are assumed to be factors in decision making around foreign intervention. Moreover, following the realist perspective, differences in military capability between the target country and the potential intervener will also have an impact on the decision making process. Finally, the relationship between the intervening states should be considered. This consideration is not only limited to the cases where there is more than one intervener. As we can infer from extended deterrence theory, the existence of another country backing one side in the civil war will yield a different decision on the part of a potential intervener."
"March 29, 2010","The reasons for the U.S. invasion of Iraq have been the subject of debate since the Iraq War began.  Scholars have focused on the role of the neoconservatives within the Bush administration.  But while there is widespread consensus about the importance of the neoconservatives to the invasion of Iraq, scholars have disagreed about the central motivation of this group.  Some analysts have focused on the neoconservativesﾒ ties to the Israel Lobby.  Others have looked at the ideological unity of these neoconservatives and their support for democracy or the ideas of Leo Strauss.  Still others have focused on the importance neoconservativesﾒ place on U.S. hegemony and unilateral action.  This paper explores a different and less examined motivation for instigating the invasion of Iraq.  I will focus on the many ties between corporate interests that the neoconservatives have, specifically looking at the military-industrial-complex.  I will examine evidence that the neoconservatives in the Bush administration were largely motivated by profits and that the war in Iraq was carried out in part to enrich the business interests of the neoconservative movement."
"March 29, 2010","The scholarship on irredentism and secessionism suggests that the former is more likely to become violent and result in war than the latter. Irredentist conflicts are often instigated by sovereign states, whereas, secessionist conflicts are usually initiated by minority groups. Since sovereign states have military capability to fight full-scale wars, irredentist conflicts tend to be more violent and/or turn international. Given that minority groups lack military resources to fight for their causes, secessionist conflicts on the other hand normally do not escalate to interstate war. However, what happens if a sovereign state with a full-fledged army decides to support a secessionist cause? Would the situation become violent and turn international? What if irredentist conflicts were instigated by groups who happened to be the minority, and not, the dominant majority inside a sovereign state? In this case would the outcome still be war? This paper argues that irredentist conflicts initiated by minorities are less likely to turn international and secessionist causes supported by sovereign states are more likely to result in interstate war. The argument is supported by evidence drawn from the Kashmiri, Kurdish and Basque conflicts."
"March 29, 2010","When in combat, both insurgent organizations and states have several strategic options available to them including: 1) non-violent policies designed to win the hearts-and-minds of civilians; 2) targeted military campaigns; and 3) terrorism.  Which strategy best enables states to combat insurgent and terrorist groups? Which strategy most effectively enables rebel organizations to challenge states?  Scholars often examine these questions separately.  That is, they tend to analyze the strategic choices of either states or insurgent organizations rather than the decisions of both actors jointly.  I argue that by doing so, they omit the most important factor affecting the outcome of insurgencies: the intersection of the strategies that each side uses to combat and influence the other.  In this inquiry, I make two arguments about the trajectory and outcome of insurgencies.  First, I contend that the outcome of these conflicts is best explained by the repeated intersection of strategic choices made by both states and rebel groups.  Second, I hypothesize that the effect of intersecting insurgency and counterinsurgency strategies will vary based on the ratio of relative power between the insurgent group and its target government.  These hypotheses are tested on a dataset of over 60 insurgent and terrorist organizations and their government opponents."

"March 29, 2010","The aim of revolutionary politics has become the search for solidarity, rather than the amelioration or systemic reform of social and political institutions.  Walter Benjaminﾒs essay on Left-Wing Melancholy was written as a critique of the melancholic sentiment among the left-wing intelligentsia during the collapse of the Weimar Republic. Benjamin critiques the lack of critical thought among the left, and their subsequent inability to create a new left-wing movement.ﾠ He argues that they took the images of old revolutions, and left behind any revolutionary thought.  In taking the images they were able to recreate the sentiment of solidarity without creating a real political agenda for social change.  Today, we are witnessing the same lapse in political judgment.  As the American economy collapsed last fall, both the radical and liberal left joined together in the triumphalism of American politics, celebrating a moment of solidarity and hope.  As could have been predicted though, Barack Obamaﾒs agenda for economic recovery has not broken with past practice, storing faith in the same failed systems.  Instead of vesting organizational energy in demanding real change, activists have once again been ensnared by the momentary spirit of solidarity."
"March 29, 2010","Much has been theorized about the impact of lustration policies, a regional form of transitional justice focused on employment vetting, on the process of democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).  Advocates of lustration highlight the alleged positive contributions of lustration to the restoration of trust in public institutions. In contrast, opponents of lustration stress the potential for lustration to violate individual rights and freedoms, thereby undermining trust in public institutions.  Using quantitative data on nine countries in CEE over an eight year time period, this study examines the timing, scope, and intensity of lustration in order to test the impact, if any, on citizen perceptions of the trustworthiness of public institutions.  This paper finds that lustration consistently and positively contributes to trust in public institutions.  While the timing of lustration is important in effecting trust in a small subset of public institutions, timing is less important than originally theorized across a range of public and semi-public institutions.  The process of lustration matters substantially.  Even controlling for economic growth, democratization, and corruption levels, lustration measures consistently and positively contribute to levels of public institutional trust in countries in CEE."
"March 29, 2010","This paper compares conflict settlement processes in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, and South Africa in the 1990s. It challenges the existing comparisons of those cases as deeply divided societies or transitions from semi-democracy. Instead, it foregrounds a key commonality of settler societies: the historical institutionalization of segmented labor markets to protect workers from native competition. The geneses of the three peace processes are compared in terms of the challenges posed to segmented labor markets by native workers and their liberal allies, and the settlements’ relative successes are explained in terms of the creation of more inclusive or exclusive labor market institutions. Settlements in South Africa and Northern Ireland were grounded in the breakdown of split labor markets and the incorporation of subordinate groups economically and politically. By contrast, the progressive re-exclusion of Palestinian workers from Israel’s labor market undermined the Oslo peace process. The goal is to focus analysis on labor market institutions as a crucial context for reproducing or resolving enduring settler-native conflicts, without reducing these ethnonational conflicts to their political-economic dimensions."
"March 29, 2010","The current global economic crisis reminds us that markets comprise long-forged social and institutional ties that can unravel in unpredictable ways. How best then to analyze markets, their creation and transformation? China's economic reforms over the past three decades provide a cogent illustration of market-making and transformation. Based on primary data sources and interviews in China, this paper compares the institutional reconstruction of three branches of China's textile industry: cotton, wool and silk. Adopting a 'global value chains' analytic framework, I find that dramatic changes in China's economic regulation of these highly globalized industries are the result of two factors: (1) how these sub-sectors are differentially linked to the international economy, and (2) the political interactions along the value chain, including China's agricultural, industrial and trade policy arenas. Over time, a series of booms and busts - some induced by the global economy, others by domestic policy - transformed the governance of these three textile chains, and with them the economic fortunes of the social groups and regions linked to these particular industries. In terms of theory, the experience of China's recent development path calls into question common assumptions about the institutional prerequisites of market systems and the role of the global economy in shaping them. A detailed comparison of these three textile sub-sectors provides a window onto these broader questions."
"March 29, 2010","The FALN, (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional) was a militant Puerto Rican independence group formed in the 1970’s as a response to the political discourses popular at the time of decolonization and civil rights. Typically characterized as American terrorists, FALN fought against the negative effects of Marx’s labor alienation but with a distinct decolonial/ Latin American style derived from Che Guevera himself. This type of alienation goes deeper than class struggle, however, as the FALN were alienated politically due to Puerto Rico’s commonwealth status and racially due to discrimination in the U.S. upon migration to the states. Therefore, Marx’s concept of alienation must be expanded upon here to include colonial alienation and racial alienation (“colonial alienation”), two sides of the same coin. Alienation will be evaluated using Marx’s definition via the U.S.’s oppressive economic strategy for the island, Operation Boostrap, and then expanded upon racially and colonially. Returning to the FALN, their political platform and communiques will be analyzed using traditional Marx but expanded upon by the additional usages of alienation. The paper will conclude with a re-evaluation of the term “terrorism” in light of “colonial alienation.”"
"March 29, 2010","Much like the field of International Relations, military theory has recently turned away from strictly positivist epistemologies to postpositivism and critical theory. This is exemplified by the emerging concept of Operational Design, which has been formalized into doctrine by both the American and Israeli militaries.  In this paper, we argue that Operational Design is grounded in the same assumptions of IR Constructivism. Operational Design is conceived as a cognitive method that empowers military organizations to reflexively and collectively learn how to conceptualize the causal structure of military problems and guide (but not direct) the emergence of new organizational cultures appropriate to the mission at hand. We proceed in three parts. Part I explores the rise of postpositivism, complexity, and chaos theory in military thought as a means of coping with the shift toward civil war and insurgency. Part II discusses Operational Design in current US Army doctrine and explores its foundation in the postpositivist military theory of Shimon Naveh and John Boyd. Finally, Part III compares Operational Design with the emergent IR paradigm of Social Constructivism, and, drawing upon the work of recent Kilcullen, conceptualizes its application to counterinsurgency missions."
"March 29, 2010","Moderation manifests itself in the tendencies of the Islamist parties to engage in more pluralist politics, tone down their religious rhetoric, embrace free market economies, open to debate the absoluteness of religious texts, albeit in different combinations and degrees. The explanations for this have mostly either focused on the role of inclusion and repression in the political processes or the role of the business sector, therefore ended up emphasizing the elites as the determining social actors. Thus the major line of thought tends to leave out the larger popular sectors both within the Islamist movements, if not represents them as the obedient followers of the political and economic elites. This paper aims to bring in the often neglected terrain of grass roots politics both within the Islamist movements and in the wider domain of ideologically ambivalent popular sectors by looking at the interaction between the movements and the people. In order to bring in this perspective, this paper examines the impact of the Islamist political party on the society and questions whether the ideological and behavioral transformations of the party leads to a wider electoral base in the society and through which they culminate into an ideational shift among the popular sectors, hence making moderation a source for more enhanced diffusion of party's goals and values. The governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Turkey is the case study through which these questions are examined."

"March 29, 2010","Paid domestic laborers make up some of the most socially marginalized, vulnerable, and exploited workers in the United States today. Understanding their precarious social position requires an appreciation of the intersection of race, gender, class, and nation, together with the historically low social status attached to domestic labor. For this reason, studying the work experiences and political activism of domestic laborers is not only valuable in helping understand their struggle; it can also offer a unique window onto the operation of social injustice in contemporary capitalist societies and point to possible remedies. The objectives of this paper are therefore twofold: 1) to explore the working conditions and experiences of paid domestic laborers in the United States, their relationships with employers, and their political activism in response to exploitation, abuse and the societal undervaluation of their occupation; and 2) to consider the extent to which Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition offers theoretical resources that assist in this endeavor. I argue that while Honneth’s ‘moral grammar of social conflict’ and recognition-theoretic account of justice provide an invaluable conceptual framework for analyzing and critiquing the work experiences of paid domestic laborers, the theory proves insufficiently sensitive to the issues of racialized oppression and powerlessness, and to paid domestic labor’s characteristic disruption of the public/private binary. The disclosure of these shortcomings thus in turn supplies a productive corrective to Honneth’s theory that refines it for the contemporary US context."
"March 29, 2010","A year after the collapse of the global financial system we can begin to see the consequences of what should constitute a critical juncture leading to substantial political economic change.  The results: despite world-wide public fury and much official debate, economic governance and financial regulation have changed little, while the surviving major financial institutions have become even larger and more powerful. This paper proposes three reasons for this outcome to date.  First, modern finance capitalism is dependent on the core institutions of the financial sector to prop up and drive the economy in the advanced industrial countries and in export-driven developing countries, which privileges the financial sector so long as no alternative growth model is in prospect.  Second, major financial institutions, including those in the ""shadow"" banking system, form a powerful and pivotal interest group with strong ties to parties on both the left and right that have helped insulate it from political attack and regulatory reform. Third, the international scope of financial firms and markets has made them far more difficult to regulate, owing to the potential mobility of capital and financial business, and the difficulty of securing multilateral consensus on financial regulation and capital flows. The result has been political paralysis, the pre-conditions for future crises, and a looming political economic legitimacy crisis."
"March 29, 2010","A flowering of recent research has sought to demonstrate that an abundance of social capital in at-risk communities is the key to individual and collective resilience, adaptation, and even survival in a crisis. Surprisingly little work, however, has investigated the conditions under which social capital might also contribute to social and institutional paralysis in times of sustained uncertainty and upheaval, and particularly in response to the increasingly salient global climate crisis. This research draws upon fieldwork in three of climate change's most endangered canaries in the coal mine - Russia, Alaska, and Canada - to elaborate those conditions. I employ interviews, participant observation, and original survey and experimental data to build upon third face of power theories and show that good social capital can go very, very bad in communities that have have historically been engineered into acquiescence at the hands of a disempowering state. If the conventional wisdom holds that social capital is an asset to communities in crisis because it builds trust, encourages reciprocity, facilitates collective action, and encourages creative problem-solving and institutional innovation, I want to suggest that, under certain conditions of permanent, routinized crisis, social capital actually becomes a critical barrier to change by imposing coercive norms, incentivizing community sanctioning, polarizing debate, and rewarding and reifying the status quo."
"March 29, 2010","The main purpose of this research is to figure out what issues divide Taiwanese. By taking advantage of public poll survey data, this paper seeks to examine whether Taiwanese have been getting more polarized on certain important social and political issues alone with party line. I hypothesize that the debate between ""Taiwan independence or unification with China"" separates Taiwanese and the division over this issue has become larger. On the other hand, the issue of ""reform versus stability"", ""economic development versus environmental protection"", and ""tax increase for better social welfare or not"" become less significant issues dividing Taiwanese since party turnover in 2000. In other words, ""independence or unification with China"" becomes the only political issues separating Taiwanese and their position on this issue divides alone with party line."
"March 29, 2010","In his essay, ""Political Reconciliation as Mutual Respect,"" Ernesto Verdeja sketches a theory of political reconciliation based on the cultivation of mutual respect among former adversaries.  Part I presents a conception of reconciliation as respect that emphasizes reciprocal recognition between equal actors.  Drawing from contemporary critical theory, it emphasizes the recognition of the inherent moral value of others, while accepting that basic worldviews and political ideologies may often remain at odds and disagreements will persist. The theory positions itself between two competing tendencies in the literature: minimalist/legalist accounts that equate reconciliation with return to the formal rule of law (typical, for example, of Bruce Ackerman and Stuart Hampshire); and second, transformative accounts based on deep, theologically-inflected conceptions of forgiveness and ""the willful embrace of the 'other,'"" common to Desmond Tutu and Miroslav Volf.  Part II sketches the various elements of a theory of reconciliation as respect.  I argue that there are five key norms at play: (1) public dissemination of the truth of past atrocities, as well as a critical interrogation of ideologies supporting the violence, (2) accountability of perpetrators, (3) public recognition and acknowledgement of victims, (both material and symbolic) (4) a commitment to the rule of law, and finally, (5) the development of mutual respect among erstwhile enemies.  For Verdeja, it is only after erstwhile adversaries can come to see each other as moral beings (even if politically at odds), that the goals of tolerance and respect can be said to take root.  Finally, in Part III, Verdeja traces the development of reconciliation across four conceptually distinct social levels: political society (the realm of ""formal"" politics); institutional (trials, truth commissions and similar institutions); civil society; and, the interpersonal level.  Such an approach highlights how reconciliation is fundamentally disjunctured and uneven, occurring across social space in different ways and susceptible to different challenges.  Using case studies as varied as Peru, Chile and Bosnia-Herzegovina, to illustrate his argument, and drawing on interviews with survivors of atrocities committed in said places, Verdeja elaborates a complex theory of respect and recognition in post-conflict societies based on the fundamental commitment to the gradual and dialectical transformation of identities that 'cut across earlier identifications.'"
"March 29, 2010","This paper proposes to explore the ways in which a major crisis like the financial meltdown of 2008 can affect the political agenda by diverting attention away from other issues, such as climate change. In addition to reviewing contemporary political dynamics, the paper will draw from one historical example that provides useful comparative insights: the agenda-shifting effect of the Sept. 11th attacks on stem cell research. Drawing policy makers and the media way from the unresolved status of embryo research, 9/11 helped build momentum for an electoral juggernaut in 2004, when voters in California and beyond granted funds for stem cell research in defiance of the Bush Administration policy. How will the effect of the financial crisis match up? Rather than reach for a conclusive answer, the paper will review methodologies for testing the impact of significant and often dramatic shifts in the U.S. political agenda, including mass media content analysis and regression analysis. It will also review the literature on agendas, including the work of Baumgartner and Jones, to assess its relevance to the current situation, and discuss opportunities for further scholarly contribution."
"March 29, 2010","Supporters of international and domestic criminal trials for atrocity crimes argue that, among other things, trials will prevent genocide in the future by deterring would-be genocidaires by ending impunity and attaching responsibility for atrocity crimes to individuals rather than groups. The historical record shows, however, that criminal trials do not always prevent atrocities through deterrence and that peace processes can been stymied by the possibility that government and/or opposition leaders may find themselves in the docket once the conflict is over. While critics of criminal trials and the International Criminal Court have made the latter observations, little has been said about why prevention may not be served by formal legal trials. Employing a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of identity construction, this paper will argue that trials do not bring prevention through deterrence because deterrence (i.e. the fear of possible punishment and making an example) does not work on genocidal elites once elites come to perceive their targets as mortal threats whose extermination is necessary to ensure the physical survival of the state and the wider community. Similarly deterrence does not work for front-line killers because the violent acts they perpetrate are ﾓemotive crimesﾔdirected by an external authority."
"March 29, 2010","The Bush administration's assertive effort to promote constitutional democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq cannot be judged a success.  An inadequate theoretical understanding of our own regime - of America's constitutional democracy - led American policy-makers to simultaneously expect too much of democratization, and to think too little of liberal democracy.  Its strategic utility was overestimated:  key policy-makers believed transforming key regimes could, in a cost effective manner, bring peace and prosperity to the Middle East, and in the long term help root out Islamist terrorism.  One of the reasons for this:  they underestimated what liberal democracy requires of its citizenry - deeply ingrained beliefs and social practices that are acquired only with difficulty, and which are likely to prove more fragile than is usually appreciated.  This paper details those 'sacred' opinions.  I argue that, in the absence of guiding convictions widely shared by the citizenry (and the invisible bonds of friendship thereby created), constitutional government is unlikely to be popular and participatory, and at the same time tolerant and liberal.  I argue, finally, that the interpretations of Islamic law so successfully disseminated by the twentieth century's most influential Islamist theorists - Hassan al-Banna, Sayyid Qutb, and Syed Abdul A'ala Maududi - constitute an important impediment to the promotion of Western-style liberal democracy in the Middle East today."
"March 29, 2010","While foreign policy literature in general would suggest that a nation of 25 million people, located clearly within the sphere of U.S. hegemony (all of the Americas presumably) is unlikely to successfully pursue an aggressively independent foreign policy, Venezuela seems to have defied the odds.  By most accounts, in the more than a decade since Hugo Chavez took office, Venezuela has effectively navigated the foreign policy waters even in the face of strong opposition from the United States.  Many of the explanations for those foreign policy 'successes' have focused on the combination of Bush administration 'neglect' of Latin America after September 11 and the concurrent high price of oil that has provided significant revenue and flexibility to the Venezuelan government.  In this paper, I argue that a better explanation for the ability of Venezuela to punch above its weight focuses on the interaction among the Chavez governmentﾒs own foreign policy decision making, U.S. foreign policy mistakes in Latin America, shifts in the global political economy, and effective grassroots mobilization throughout the region."
"March 29, 2010","For more than a decade, researchers have debated the prospect of major powers bringing about democratization through military intervention.  With the difficulties of the Iraq War, many believe that this idea has fallen out of favor with policy makers. Nonetheless, Afghanistan and other examples of attempts at creating democracy by force show that this policy option is alive and well for both the United States as well as other actors. This paper will not argue for or against the utility of this policy. Rather, it will look at the empirical evidence: which choices and strategies enhance the likelihood of successful intervention, and which do not? This is a policy that needs to be dissected into finer pieces. The paper will conclude with policy implications of the findings."
"March 29, 2010","From the shouts of 'You lie!' and 'Keep the government out of my Medicare!' to threats of 'Obama death panels' and promises to assure affordable, quality health coverage for all Americans', health care reform is the foremost social policy debate in the U.S. in the wake of the global economic crisis. Certainly the contemporary debates around health care reform in the United States are debates about the scope and size of government, partisan politics, and race in America. But they are also debates about deservingness who deserves what from whom, how and why? In this paper I use interpretive methods to map the lines of deservingness and undeservingness in the current health care reform debates, paying particular attention to the ways in which gender, race, class, age and citizenship status construct these distinctions of deservingness. Drawing from a variety of sources from across the spectrum of news media to legislation, the congressional record and presidential statements to interest group publications and citizen responses, I uncover sites of contestation and sites of agreement about where these lines of deservingness are drawn. Having established the cartography of deservingness in health care reform, I speculate on what this might mean for the politics of health care reform in the United States and for the social citizenship of those groups marked as especially deserving or undeserving."
"March 29, 2010","The impact of domestic regimes on international relations has been understudied at best. Liberalism has only focused on democratic regimes, and anarchy restores its central role when non-liberal regimes are involved. Constructivism, despite its emphasis on social construction of anarchy, underspecifies the process through which shared knowledge, material resources, and practices lead to a certain behavior of states or development of an institution. This paper argues that international relations theories have a lot to gain from the insight of comparative politics, that is, the study of political regime types and diffusion, not only when it comes to civil war or ethnic conflicts, but concerning the functioning of anarchy and international institutions. More attention should be paid to the role of regime types, historical turning points and institutional diffusion. An empirical focus of this paper is on the shift in the Soviet energy policy after its demise. How has the political transition affected the relationship between Russia and other post-Soviet countries, and how is it shaping the relationship between Russia and the EU in areas of energy transmission? This paper demonstrates how theories of international relations and comparative politics can provide more powerful policy implications when their insights are combined."
"March 29, 2010","The U.N. currently has seven active peacekeeping mandates throughout Africa and the majority of the missions have included a standardized template for disarmament demobilization and reintegration policy. Strategies concerning the reintegration of ex-combatants have varied according to the intervention but all have espoused the common goal of reconstituting a weakened civil society by reintegrating rather than excluding those associated with the civil conflict through resocialization and economic assistance.  Although the success of such programs has varied, the United Nations has officially acknowledged the success of the Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration Programme in Liberia. Despite high numbers of fully reintegrated ex-combatants however, widespread crime and mob violence has continued throughout the country. The question remains, why has mob violence continued even after a supposedly successful DDR program in Liberia and more importantly why has this violence been discounted by U.N. policy as being non-political? Analysis will center around analyzing the discourse and characterization of violence within the last year of the United Nations Mission in Liberia. In order to determine if the violence is indeed political and perhaps mischaracterized by the United Nations, a comparison in how violence is discussed will be made between local media and official U.N. reports and Press Releases."
"March 29, 2010","Security Sector Reform (SSR) has assumed increasing importance in the post-conflict reconstruction process and added to the list of transitional justice mechanisms. Yet the relationship between SSR and transitional justice is largely underexplored, even if they share many of the same goals: accountability for past crimes, capacity building to strengthen the rule of law, legitimacy, and deterrence. This paper traces and analyzes the evolution of the inter-institutional division of labor between the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), and NATO Mission in Kosovo (KFOR) on SSR and transitional justice matters in Kosovo."
"March 29, 2010","Many students of public policy acknowledge the clash of values that defines the conflict between environmentalists and their opponents. However, less work has been done to examine ways in which the clash of values - represented in disparate discourses of nature - among environmentalists themselves has contributed to disarray and incoherence in the American environmental policy regime. This paper builds on a genealogy of environmental discourses to assess the potential for consensus-building among environmental discourses and their adherents presented by different democratic institutions. First, I defend the search for consensus in part by reference to other policy regimes in which a basic common core discourse serves to guide and structure debate (which is never ruled out) within the arena. Drawing on my prior analysis of environmental discourses, I identify possible concepts or values that could serve as foundations for a shared discourse. Second, I turn to democratic theory to assess the consensus potential of different models. I argue that collaborative and deliberative democratic institutions produce a greater chance for identifying and building on common values among discourses of nature than traditional adversarial processes, and thus could lead to a more consistent and coherent environmental policy regime."
"March 29, 2010","The quantitative literature on civil conflict is generally concerned with state-level risk factors. By conceptualizing the state as the unit of analysis this literature suffers from an aggregation problem in regards to its main findings, which identify mechanisms that are often only indirectly related to conflict initiation (e.g. mountains, development). Aggregation at the state-level does not tell us enough about how and why rebel groups form, especially since rebels are not randomly selected. Instead, rebel groups tend to be from distinct social groups in society, identity based or ideological. This project seeks to intervene in this literature by asking two related questions. What affects the likelihood that an identity group will produce an associated rebel group? And when are rebellions isolated to specific identity groups and when do they achieve broader mobilization? By reframing the question(s) of civil conflict this way, we re-conceptualize the unit of analysis from the state level to the group level. By focusing on the group level dynamics we can get closer to identifying the direct mechanisms that cause conflict. This study contrasts a number of group-level variables (political, economic, and social) against established state-level variables. The quantitative analysis is conducted on a sample, consisting of 16 states and 92 identity groups, of a newly developed group-level dataset."
"March 29, 2010","I report preliminary results from the Central Asian Student Survey, a survey of students at four universities in Afghanistan. The first of four planned waves in a panel survey, it will allow us to assess the impact of higher education on attitude formation among the future elites of these countries. This wave, administered in March 2009 in Kabul, along with in-person interviews, measures students' social capital, identity development, attitudes towards political institutions and individual rights, as well as their preferences for key public policies. The participating universities are backed by different foreign countries - Iran, Turkey, Russia, Kuwait and the United States - as part of long-term efforts to gain influence in this part of the world. I also assess efforts to increase 'soft power,' in Central Asia. By following these students over the course of their educational careers we will be able to assess comparative effectiveness of different countries' efforts to project soft power. Among the most interesting findings so far is that in tandem with very broad support for the policy goal of defeating the Taliban, there exists an almost universal conviction among Afghan university students that the United States is failing to defeat the Taliban on purpose."
"March 29, 2010","How does the education of children shape the prospects for lasting peace in countries recently rent by civil war? When the wars that raged through the former Yugoslavia ended, the fight over ethnically cleansed territory moved from the battlefield to the classroom, and is now being waged over the next generation's identities. Students throughout the region continue to learn group-specific curricula in segregated schools. Conflicts over post-conflict education reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina (B-H) and Croatia have pitted ethno-nationalist entrepreneurs against the international community, which seeks to reconcile the deep divisions wrought by armed conflict. This paper investigates how international interventions in education are perceived by the local communities through an analysis of a large qualitative dataset, which includes 78 interviews and 20 focus groups with 140 principals, teachers, students and parents in the divided towns of Mostar, B-H and Vukovar, Croatia. The analysis reveals that the international community's efforts to reintegrate the schools constitute a symbolic threat to many respondents' ethno-national identities. These findings are in line with a long line of work in the social identity theory tradition which suggests that symbolic threats to collective identity play an important role in inter-group behavior. From these findings, I argue that education reform efforts in post-conflict contexts need to take symbolic threats to identity seriously."
"March 29, 2010","Hezbollah and Fatah have managed to transition from terrorist organizations to legitimate government entities through winning and maintaining public support.  The purpose of this paper is to explore the policy changes made by Hezbollah and Fatah after deciding to participate in government.  Specifically, this study will compare and contrast Hezbollah’s and Fatah’s policies before and after becoming an official representative in each government.  Once the policy changes undertaken by Hezbollah and Fatah are understood, further analysis of reasons for these policy changes can begin.  By understanding the process through which Hezbollah and Fatah have transitioned from terrorist organization to legitimate government entities, a model can be created which other terrorists groups can emulate."
"March 29, 2010","Throughout the 1990s proponents of the ﾑWashington Consensusﾒ promoted the idea of a positive relationship between economic liberalization and democracy.  Adherents of this perspective argued that the introduction of market forces democracy would shift the balance of power away from the state towards civil society. However, recent experiences in many transitional suggests that liberal politics and economics has done more to entrench incumbent elites, stregnthen and weaken political opposition. This research seeks to understand why many governments have reached this stalemate in the liberalization process by analyzing the social origins of emerging political regimes by examining the local, national and international forces involved in developing Tanzania's Coffee Industry Policy.  Towards this end, this research will propose an empirical political economy model that views institutional outcomes as a result of shifts in power relations between local and national state and non-state institutions, information asymmetries, and oligopolistic behavior of non-state actors.  It is argued that this research will shed light on the relationship between market liberalization and democratic development, the origins of the present economic structure and political regime, the divided character of the ruling elite, the role of the state, and the impact of informal institutions on formal institutional outcomes."
"March 29, 2010","Judge-made law has played a crucial role in the process of European integration. In the vertical dimension, it has greatly reduced the range of autonomous policy choices in the member states, and it has helped to expand the reach of European competences. At the same time, however, ‘integration through law’ does have a liberalizing and deregulatory impact on the socio-economic regimes of European Union member states. This effect is generally compatible with the status quo in liberal market economies, but it tends to undermine the institutions and policy legacies of Continental and Scandinavian social market economies. Given the high consensus requirements of European legislation, this structural asymmetry cannot be corrected through political action at the European level."
"March 29, 2010","In this paper I will use qualitative comparative analysis to determine the causes of populism in Latin America.  The data set will include all of the presidential elections in Spanish-speaking South America since 1980, roughly the time of the third wave of democratization.  I will examine several explanatory variables, including economic crisis, institutional weakness, crisis of representation, political associational space, and others.  My expectation is that political associational space in combination with either economic or social distress will create the permissive conditions for populism, yet ambitious politicians will not take advantage of those conditions in every instance (i.e., there is a role for agency).  This research is important and timely, as populism has reappeared with some strength in recent years in Latin America and in other regions of the world.  Despite this fact, the theorization on the causes of populism remains underdeveloped as it is largely based on single case studies, not broad comparative analysis."
"March 29, 2010","How do we explain why some countries have gone farther than others in their utilization of armed forces in non-military missions? After all, are the military as agent of modernization still relevant today? Mainstream theoretical approaches in comparative politics have difficulty responding to these questions. Whether they theorize justification for military's extended role in non-military missions, skeptical to such enquires, these approaches tend to underestimate either danger of military massive involvement in society, or benefit of borrowing manpower of standing army during the peacetime. This article examines China's utilization of its armed forces for non-military missions while maintaining civilian supremacy and military professionalism. This article suggests that the PLA were able to play the role of modernization agent with shared beliefs that served as integrating glue holding the military and party together."
"March 29, 2010","Despite the presence of significant material constraints that raised Jordanﾒs and Israelﾒs interest in reaching a peace agreement in 1994 that included arrangements for managing and distributing their shared water resources, material factors did not have a decisive impact.   The material factors at work were formidable and produced a strong incentive to change the fundamental pattern of Israeli-Jordanian relations, yet were not so powerful or overriding as to foreclose any avenue but cooperation.  Moreover, many of these material forces were of an enduring nature, thus begging the question: why did Jordan and Israel sign the peace treaty and related protocol over shared water resources when they did?   The timing of their decision, I argue, is far better accounted for by the development of trust between the two co-riparian states. Israeli and Jordanian leaders had long been aware of convergent interests with respect to both natural resources and other areas of their bilateral relationship.  However, their perceptions of each otherﾒs trustworthiness acted as a filter for how they understood their interests. Prospects for peace did not ripen until the negotiations fell under the purview of leaders who proved able to overcome the obstacles of the past through the strong sense of interpersonal trust they forged, reinforcing their determination to guide negotiations over water sharing to a successful conclusion."
"March 29, 2010","The legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government possess many resources to influence the political development of foreign states. However, in addition to the various executive agencies that deal with foreign policy, and the congressional resources that fund those agencies, the judicial branch exercises considerable influence abroad. This aspect of U.S. foreign policy has been overlooked in international relations literature and stands as an underutilized tool to advance U.S. interests and ensure a peaceful international legal order. This paper conducts an empirical longitudinal study of citations to U.S. law in foreign jurisdictions. The preliminary findings of this paper challenge several common explanations of norm diffusion in the international system. Much of the international relations literature concerning the diffusion of norms from one state into another state rich in opposed local norms, e.g. the United States and China emphasizes the need for 'norm localization' and 'pattern maintenance' in order to overcome local resistance (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998; Acharya, 2004). Contrary to these claims, citations to U.S. law pervade both common and civil law systems and suggest instead that the diffusion of U.S. law is enabled by nonstate actors, especially during periods of economic crisis."
"March 29, 2010","Does the global economic crisis negatively impact the prospects of democratization around the world? This is a time-series, cross-national study that tests the effects of the economic meltdown on the level of democratization for new democracies around the world for 2007 to 2009.  It tests economic growth measured as the quarterly economic rate growth against different indexes of democracy, and different indicators of democracy, while controlling for region of the world, ethnic fractionalization, institutions, and wealth. The expectation is that the current economic crisis has negatively impacted the speed of democratization around the world. The intellectual interest for this effect is to understand if new democracies can survive the test of economic meltdowns."
"March 29, 2010","This paper examines the current impact of the continued presence of the FARC in Colombia. Is the FARC merely a terrorist organization engrossed in narcotrafficking and the predatory tactics of survival or does it represent a legitimate political movement or alternative? Does the continued existence of the FARC represent an asset or an impediment to the various groups, movements and parties seeking alternatives to capitalist globalization and Colombia's acquiescence to U.S. economic/political policies? Finally should the Colombian 'left' sever any ties to the FARC or should it attempt to integrate the group into the political process? The aforementioned questions hold particular salience now as the political left in Colombia is arguably emergent while the FARC has faced vigorous military and political attacks during the Uribe administration and has had to endure the loss of membership and the deaths of several high level leaders."
"March 29, 2010","With the Maoist insurgency in Nepal currently bound in the more pacific realm of electoral politics, questions arise about how an initially modest insurgency came so close to overwhelming the Nepali state.  This paper seeks to address two primary questions: first, why did the insurgency arise where and when it did, and second, after its initial efforts what accounts for the rapid geographic spread of the insurgency?  In order to address these questions, the paper engages in a subnational analysis of the dynamics of the civil conflict, systematically marshaling district-level information from the 75 districts of Nepal.  At the same time, it places the rise and spread of the insurgency in historical context and argues that development over time is critical to understanding the nature of the civil war.  In so doing, the paper offers a systematic analysis of the political history and geography of the war and offers a corrective to quantitative but generally ahistorical accounts of the war found in existing research."
"March 29, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to analyze the United States Congressional influence on the Agreed Framework between the United States and North Korea and its fulfillment in the Clinton administration. Specially, focusing on the Republican influence on the North Korean nuclear agenda, this study will reveal how huge the Congressional influence on the Agreed Framework was."
"March 29, 2010","Recent events in Argentina represent an intriguing puzzle for students of contentious politics. Argentina ranks among Latin Americaﾒs most developed countries, boasting relatively high per capita income, impressive levels of education and human capital, and widespread support for democracy. Yet the contemporary political climate in this large South American nation is one of heated conflict between citizens and government, including widespread, and oftentimes violent, mass protest. These incidents thus raise an exceedingly important question: Why has Argentina experienced such high levels of protest in recent years? Utilizing data from the AmericasBarometer 2008 round of surveys, I propose and test a political institutional explanation of protest participation in Argentina. I argue that protest has become an integral component of the countryﾒs everyday political life, as Argentines have taken to the streets in response to inefficacious representative institutions. Thus, contrary to the common notion that Latin American protest movements are motivated by relative deprivation or the mobilization of resources, I find that protest can become part of the repertoire of conventional responses to an ineffective political system."
"March 29, 2010","Recent volatility in commodity prices has resulted in riots and demonstrations in an array of countries. From truck drivers in the United States to fisherman in Japan, citizens have sought remedy recently from their governments to increasing prices that jeopardize their livelihood and well-being. The most common reaction by governments to address high prices has been an array of subsidies geared toward directly influencing market prices, thereby appeasing citizens, reducing political challenge, and ensuring their survival. Despite the problems caused by such policies, including inflationary pressures, these governments utilize subsidies to dampen opposition and prolong their political survival. This research examines this relationship using a survival analysis of 62 countries from 1980 to 2007 to determine if government subsidies have an influence on government survival, and if so, how large an influence they have. We find that the use of government subsidies to quell domestic unrest in light of rising prices directly influences the ability of governments to retain power, though their ability to do so during periods of economic crisis is strained making them increasingly vulnerable."
"March 29, 2010","Although it commonly is assumed that economic liberalization will lead to strain between society and an authoritarian regime, when it comes to college-educated individuals in China, this has not been the case. To the contrary, as China's reform era has progressed, those pursuing university degrees have evidenced a general decline in support for systemic political change, and a greater interest in embedding themselves in the current system. In the 1980s, relations between college-educated youths and the state were increasingly attenuated, and at times flared into outright confrontation. Yet since the early 1990s, college students have evidenced a much more positive view of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-led political system. Indeed, when college-educated youth have taken to the streets, it generally has been to defend China - and the Chinese government - against its foreign and domestic detractors. Simultaneously, since the early 1990s, college students have joined the CCP in growing numbers. This paper argues that this development may be explained largely by: (1) the commercialization and massification of higher education in China, and (2) the unity of the top CCP leadership since the early 1990s. At the same time, the paper emphasizes that one must not over-exaggerate the difference between the political attitudes of Chinese university students pre and post-1989. For, despite the clear changes that have occurred, some continuities and commonalities are apparent."
"March 29, 2010","In the face of massive human rights violations committed by the armed forces and paramilitary collaborators, the Colombian government launched a comprehensive human rights program in the late 1980s meant to reduce impunity and human rights violations. The state embraced human rights discourses, created hundreds of new human rights institutions, and accepted international funding and expertise for human rights projects, including the creation of a system of Justice Houses throughout the country. Justice Houses were supposed to reduce violence and impunity by helping citizens negotiate the complex legal system and report crimes. Yet the Housesﾒ primary programming focuses on teaching civilians how to resolve their own justice problems. Victims of human rights violations are taught mechanisms of peaceful conflict resolution and community justice, including reconciliation, tolerance for difference, and conflict mediation. Based on three months of interviews, archival research, and participant observation at the Justice Houses, I explore the differentiated effects on and responses from community members. I illustrate the local perversion of globalized discourses of conflict resolution and restorative justice. Finally, I demonstrate how these discourses and policies have perpetuated impunity for both crimes against humanity committed by paramilitaries as well as for routinized forms of gender, sexual, and domestic violence."
"March 29, 2010","This paper examines the determinants of economic growth in countries emerging from civil war.  While there is substantial evidence that economic growth is a key factor in maintaining peace after civil war, the existing literature has not explained the unique factors that may account for the large variation in growth across post-civil war countries.  I argue that war outcomes affect the ability of the state to effectively implement policies conducive to economic growth.  Using a statistical analysis of 114 cases of civil war between 1944 and 1997, my preliminary findings strongly suggest that states whose wars end in negotiated peace agreements experience lower levels of economic growth than states whose wars end in military victory by one side.   I explain this finding by suggesting that the war outcomes condition the ability of a state to balance the political and economic demands of the population.  Negotiated settlements force the state to prioritize political demands, which are frequently a condition of settlement, while perhaps sacrificing economic goals and hindering growth.  However, because economic growth is an essential factor for sustained peace, this presents policy makers with a difficult post-war dilemma."
"March 29, 2010","Why do some states promote agreement among adversarial parties while others resort to litigation? In his book, Adversarial Legalism, Kagan (2001) argues that America has become increasingly litigious by virtue of its political culture and the structure of its institutions. However, by generalizing across the whole United States, Kagan (2001) overlooks how the structure of state political institutions leads some stakeholders to find alternative means for resolving policy conflicts. In this paper, I employ three case studies of states in the Inland Northwest facing the prospect of litigation to resolve intractable policy disputes. Along with the economic consequences of regulating the practice, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho have all confronted the health and environmental problems associated with bluegrass burning in their respective states. Each state in the region has resolved the same problem differently. When multiple institutional venues exist for pursuing policy goals, why is one venue chosen over another?  What explains the distinct paths taken by these three states in resolving this policy problem and do the benefits/effects of choosing one path exceed the benefits/effects of choosing another path?  In this paper, I find that different state institutions and broader national developments either raise or lower transaction costs among adversarial parties, causing some to pursue resolutions within the judiciary while others collaborate in other policymaking venues."
"March 29, 2010","Scientific research has been increasingly involved in justifying public health policy changes relating to the use and taxation of tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, and food. In response, industries selling such products have developed research programs intended to prove they pose limited public health risks. Such research has historically been likely to find results palatable to funders, spurring intensive research regarding how financial conflicts of interest influence research findings. However, little research has considered whether this conflicted research is effective in shifting popular perceptions about what constitutes public health risks. We investigate how research on tobacco and pharmaceuticals is perceived relative to other public health risks in the context of eight training workshops designed to improve the understanding of scientific research. Workshops focus on the critical appraisal of research findings, including a discussion of what constitutes bias in research, and enroll 20-30 clinicians, consumer advocates, journalists, or parents of school-age children in each session. The workshop curriculum presents and critiques research studies. We analyze transcripts of the sessions for content regarding initial perceptions of health risks and assessments of credibility, and the extent to which beliefs change in the course of the workshop. Our findings suggest the extent to which conflicted research is embedded in popular perceptions of health risks."
"March 29, 2010","This paper addresses the question, ﾓWhy has civil society been successful at pushing regimes in the MENA region to enact political reforms in some cases, while civil society efforts have largely failed in other instances?ﾔ Specifically, it will examine the relationship between the regime and civil society in Morocco and Egypt to determine the primary reason that the Moroccan regime has remained tolerant (and at times even encouraging) of civil society, while the Egyptian regime has enacted harsher and harsher limits on civil society. My hypothesis is that the driving explanatory variable is geostrategic factors (i.e. each stateﾒs relationship with the United States and role in the Arab-Israeli conflict).  As this paper will show, civil society efforts are most likely to succeed in states of lesser geostrategic importance to the United States, states with a minimal role in the Arab-Israeli conflict and in areas where the goals of civil society and international democracy promoters work in concert with one another (that is, where the rhetoric and reality of international democracy promotion efforts are one in the same)."
"March 29, 2010","Are there limits to the expression of Islam in Muslim majority countries? This paper presents evidence from Muslim-majority countriesﾗfocusing in particular on Turkey and Central Asiaﾗto demonstrate that minority Muslim movements are restricted in both secular and religious Islamic countries due to official restrictions against religious expression. I find that intolerance of dissenting or alternative Muslim voices is a result of state-centered policies that attempt to control all aspects of religious expression by formulating a single official version of Islam. I thus conclude that religious conflicts in majority Muslim countries are less a result of sectarian tensions and instead indicative of the nature of power relations. Struggles over the distribution of resources in the developing world contribute to the unequal treatment of both Muslim and non-Muslim minorities, and continue the pattern of authoritarian rule that persists across much of the Muslim world."
"March 29, 2010","This paper extends recent theoretical developments on transnational activism and norm diffusion by examining the dynamics of norm contestation visible in socio-ecological controversies about water and other bio-resources.  It examines cases in which turbulent change in established normative foundations is underway, and in which a plurality of norm-generative processes are at work simultaneously. Three key conceptual points are advanced: first, new international norms do not fill a vacuum so much as they supplant, or graft themselves onto, prevailing social rules, values, and ideational frameworks.   Second, in a context marked by rival bundles of potential norms, there may be multiple processes of learning, incentivization, or emulation at work at the same time.  Third, socio-ecological conflicts are frequently transboundary and trans-local, necessitating an approach that unpacks and rethinks the state as a domain, and reconsiders the sorts of transnational linkages and actors that emanate into and out of various contested ﾓdomesticﾔ political spaces.  These points are illustrated through an analysis of transnational water activism and contestation over in situ biological resources (ﾓbio-resourcesﾔ)."
"March 29, 2010","Beginning in the 1930s, the U.S. government employed urban sprawl to profitably absorb the country's industrial output (especially automobiles). The fact that the U.S. government could utilize urban sprawl in the context of the Great Depression to expand its market for consumer durables (goods expected to last at three years) meant that it did not have to pursue a revisionist foreign policy to attain external markets. In the post-World War period urban sprawl in the U.S. continued to persist and expand, and this resulted in a more aggressive U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East - where the majority of the world's petroleum lies. The public policies forwarding urban sprawl, and the ancillary policies surrounding urban sprawl, have historically been fostered by economic elites and producer groups. This is consistent with economic elite theory, whose proponents hold that economic elites and producer groups are at the center of public policy formation and state behavior."
"March 29, 2010","This research explores interest group natural gas policy conflicts in Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico to determine the relationship among competing actors' problem definitions, narrative strategies and beliefs, and agenda status.  Using interest group public consumption documents I perform longitudinal problem definition analysis to demonstrate how pro-development status quo actors and challengers act strategically through their policy narratives. This research furthers our understanding of how competing groups promote or refute status quo policies and under what circumstances rare problem redefinitions occur.  I also provide several suggestions to help clarify the relationship between interest group beliefs and strategies, a point of debate in the literature.  Finally, I empirically test how, why, and in what form competing interest group problem definitions succeed or fail to achieve state legislative agenda status.  Results indicate that interest group strategies change quickly, reflect a mix of conflict expansion and containment, and are strongly influenced by policy learning.  Changes in the Rocky Mountain West political context including electoral shifts, revenue sources, and population booms are major controls on issue agenda status.  However, strategic reframing, venue shopping, and decades of 'softening up' the state legislatures (Kingdon 1995) by status quo challengers has enabled alternative problem definitions to achieve formal status in several of the cases."
"March 29, 2010","This paper examines how political competition on a non-economic dimension affects redistribution. More specifically, the paper argues that a high degree of party polarization on a non-economic policy dimension modifies the political response to growing income inequalities. Data from the World Values Survey and the Comparative Manifesto Project are employed to show that party polarization on a traditional moral dimension of politics is associated with a weaker relationship between income and subjective position on the Left-Right scale. Because party polarization is associated with a weaker relationship between income and leftism, the paper claims that the political response to increases in inequality will be weaker in polarized countries. The empirical analysis using redistribution data from the Luxembourg Income Study demonstrates that the positive effect of increases in market inequality on redistribution is lower when party polarization on the non-economic dimension is high."
"March 29, 2010","Through an empirical analysis of the economic sanctions episodes from 1960 to 2000, this study explores domestic political factors determining the outcome of ""economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool"". The study is based on the game theoretical logic that a state leadership under economic sanctions pursues a short term goal of maximizing the chance of its maintaining political authority. This study demonstrates that the type of target state's behavior at stake (security issue/domestic issue) and its domestic political conditions (size of winning coalition and political stability) interactively shape the target leadership's perceived political costs from the economic sanctions."
"March 29, 2010","Why do individuals participate in contentious ethnonationalist movements often at great risk to themselves and others? Furthermore, why do they sometimes chose to exit from these movements?  This paper attempts to answer these types of questions by interviewing individual participants of various ethnonationalist movements in South Asia, especially the Sikh case in India.  In terms of theory, this paper also offers a critical reassessment of the rational-choice, social constructivist, and socio-psychological explanations for individual participation in collective ethnonationalist movements."
"March 28, 2010","Victims of human trafficking live in a world of fear and despair. The treatment afforded to these victims when they finally emerge from the violent and brutal cycle of human trafficking tells us something about our own societies. This Study has been undertaken to evaluate the progress made by various developed countries towards implementing their international obligations to protect victims of human trafficking, and to assess the treatment given to these victims in comparison to international best practices."
"March 28, 2010","This essay takes President John F. Kennedy’s visionary ‘Declaration of Interdependence’ of 1962, in which he called for a concrete transatlantic partnership on equal footing as the benchmark to assess today’s relationship between the USA and the European Union in defense matters. The central question is: can the European Union with its emerging security and defense policy be seen as one of the two supporting pillars of NATO next to the USA? To this end, the general security strategies, the institutional frameworks and capabilities, as well as the defense industries of both sides are compared. The result is that, although the strategies and initiatives taken by the EU point towards a more equitable partnership, the current state of capabilities and defense industries make it impossible to conclude that NATO rests on two equal pillars. Nevertheless, in view of the history of European integration and in anticipation of the fresh impetus to be given by the Obama administration, the author closes by suggesting a less static image of the transatlantic partnership, namely that of an ever-changing, yet ever-closer partnership."
"March 28, 2010","The European integration project has shaped a legal reality where the importance of particular Member State nationalities is dwarfed in relation to that of EU citizenship. Currently the Member States’ nationalities, short of being abolished in the legal sense, mostly serve as access points to the status of EU citizenship, which has also come to influence the rules for the acquisition of the Member States' nationalities. Six Member States already provide for different naturalization procedures for the acquisition of nationality for those already in possession of the EU citizenship status. The majority of the assumptions regarding Member State nationalities stand to be profoundly questioned today. EU citizenship is no longer a merely derivative status, leading to the need for re-conceptualization of its relationship with the nationalities of the Member States, if not opening a new chapter in the process of European integration."
"March 28, 2010","Consistent with a resolution of the government of Israel, in 2005, Israel withdrew all Israeli military forces from Gaza, forcibly removed all Israeli civilians, and dismantled its military administration in the entirety of the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israel abandoned its presence in the “Philadelphia Corridor” – the border area between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Two years later, Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip."
"March 27, 2010","The aim of this paper is to interpret the relationships between information networks and the massacres in Colombia. Over a period of paramilitary violence networks of informants were used with a strategic purpose. In fact, the paramilitaries were preparing each slaughter counting information previously learned between the inhabitants of the town. For these reasons, it is shown that information is a key phenomenon to understand civil wars. Moreover, as demonstrated in this work is the evolution of the slaughter in the civil wars as a result of rumor and information."
"March 27, 2010","For a progressive country, internal peace and stability are more important so that a common citizen is able to live peacefully and perform his duties without any fear. But withering away of the authority of the government, religious cleavages, tribalism violence, overcrowding, crime, terrorism, desertification and deforestation, social failure and the repressive apparatus of the state security force will lead to increasingly anarchic conditions aggravated by the erosion of the nation state and the empowerment of the private armies. In this paper, an effort has been made to analyse the vulnerability of India’s internal security that led to 26 November, 2008 Mumbai attack and the action taken by the security forces to tackle such type of attacks."
"March 26, 2010","Amidst the recent record-breaking spike in oil prices, many resource-rich countries have moved aggressively to increase national control over large, internationally-financed hydrocarbon projects. Commentators have sensationalized these breaches as politically-motivated moves toward resource nationalism and a reflection of a weak rule of law. This commentary, however, oversimplifies a complex phenomenon. Many countries accused of resource nationalism have selectively renegotiated contracts and have stopped far short of full-scale nationalization. Furthermore, other resource-rich countries — often with weaker systems of legal enforcement and similar political incentives to renegotiate — have reacted to the oil boom by respecting long-term contracts and encouraging additional foreign investment. Russia and Azerbaijan can help us understand the forces driving these recent developments in the hydrocarbon industry: while Russia has renegotiated long-term contracts and partially re-nationalized its hydrocarbon industry, Azerbaijan has done the opposite. Comparing these two countries, this article will propose that these differing responses are strategic reactions to the oil boom. Both countries still require access to the technology, capital, and political connections of international oil companies to pursue their interests; thus, the ex post reputational costs of contractual breach have helped insulate long-term contracts from expropriation in the absence of a strong rule of law. Thus, like in other business communities that do not have access to impartial court systems to enforce contracts, maintaining a good reputation has emerged as a key factor in ensuring the stability of existing long-term hydrocarbon contracts."
"March 26, 2010","This Article analyzes the Energy Security Through Transparency Act (ESTTA), which was introduced in the U.S. Senate on September 23, 2009 and passed on July 15, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation will amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to impose new disclosure and reporting obligations on securities issuers that engage in natural resource extraction projects in foreign countries. These requirements are of particular interest to development and anti-corruption advocates because they represent a novel strategy – based on extraterritorial information-forcing – to combat the “resource curse,” which describes the paradoxical inverse relationship between natural resource abundance on the one hand and economic growth, good governance, and political stability on the other. Beginning with an introduction to the resource curse phenomenon, this Article discusses the ESTTA in light of its antecedents, notably the voluntary, multi-stakeholder Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Informed by this background, the Article identifies two related types of limitations that, if left unaddressed over the long term, may prevent the statute from achieving all of its objectives. Written prior to final passage of the Dodd-Frank bill in the spring of 2010, the Article concludes with several proposals to improve the effectiveness of the ESTTA, as introduced. These suggestions remain relevant as the SEC works to implement the law and civil society groups begin to grapple with a new source of detailed information about the relationship between natural resource wealth, corruption, and development."
"March 25, 2010","Bioprospection practices have proliferated as biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies engage in the collection and genetic screening of biological and genetic resources throughout the world. The purpose of this article is to examine the competing proposals for the institutional framing of bioprospection based on the provisions of access and benefit-sharing embodied in the Convention on Biological Diversity. In particular, through evaluating the contribution of neo-institutionalist and evolutionist propositions in economic theory our aim is to define the conditions of a more reflexive approach to governance in the context of the problem of the emergent regime on access and benefit sharing."
"March 25, 2010","As a result of the February 28, 1997, incident, Islamist parties have been ostracized and excluded from governmental politics. This has caused serious legitimacy, participation and representation crises in the Turkish polity. This study examines whether the Justice and Development Party’s (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi-AKP) landslide victory in the Nov. 2002 elections has put an end to the Feb. 28 Process. It also suggests that further liberalization of the Turkish regime will be possible only if the religious and secular parties come together and agree on the rules for future engagement. Thus, with reference to President İnönü’s July 12 Declaration and the Israeli status quo model of 1947, this essay attempts to sketch out these rules of engagement."
"March 25, 2010","A growing body of research focuses on the expanding roles of NGOs in global and supranational governance. The research emphasizes the increasing number of participation patterns of NGOs in policymaking and cross-national cooperation. It has produced important insights into the evolving political role of NGOs and their growing involvement in governance. The focus on activities at a transnational level has, however, lead to the virtual exclusion of research on other levels of governance. It has not been possible to tell whether the locus of their political activity is shifting from the national to the transnational environment, or whether it is simply broadening. Missing from the literature is an examination of the variety of cooperative relationships, including those between NGOs, which impact policy involvement across different levels of governance. To bridge this gap, I address two key questions: 1) Is the strategy of cooperation among NGOs a common feature of social movement activity across levels of governance, and if so, what does the structure of cooperation look like? 2) What impact, if any, does cooperation have on the expanding political involvement of NGOS, both within and across levels of governance? Using data from an original survey of migrant and refugee organizations across much of Europe, I test several hypotheses that shed light on these issues. The findings broadly indicate that 1) Cooperation is a widely-used strategy across levels of governance, 2) Cooperation with specific sets of actors increases the likelihood of NGO involvement at different levels of governance. Specifically, cooperation with EU-level actors increases the likelihood of national-level involvement, and 3) NGOs are more likely to extend their involvement across a range of institutions if they cooperate with a broad range of actors."

"March 25, 2010","Orders, whether they are oral or written directives, remain an everyday occurrence in the Australian Defence Force and strict obedience is required for the effective running of a unit. But what happens when, for one reason or another, an unlawful order is given? Would a subordinate mindlessly follow such direction, or refuse to execute it? Are they even capable of telling the difference between a lawful and unlawful order? Whilst it was not practical to study all members of the Australian Defence Force, it was possible to conduct a small survey of the officer cadets and midshipmen (cadets) being trained at the Australian Defence Force Academy. These cadets were recruited by the military for their intelligence, leadership skills and potential for becoming officers in the Royal Australian Air Force, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy. The graduating class of 2001 (218 third-year cadets) were surveyed to determine how they conceive of their rights and obligations in the area of superior orders and lawful dissent from orders. Given that when they graduate they will be required to issue orders to their subordinates and receive orders from their (more experienced) superiors, their knowledge about superior orders and lawful dissent is particularly interesting."

The intentional use of lethal force against a specific individual takes on different legal complexions, depending on whether it is viewed through the frame of reference of international humanitarian law (IHL) or international human rights (IHR)."
"March 25, 2010","In a recent ruling, a Nigerian High Court ordered that proceedings brought before the court, by a student who was aggrieved by his impeachment from the position of President of the Students' Union of the, University of Nigeria, be stayed pending the determination of the dispute by the Judicial Council of the Union. This article considers the legal basis for this ruling and argues that the court has in effect determined that the student courts that operate in a number of Nigerian higher-institutions enjoy the status of arbitral tribunals under Nigerian law. 'The article also argues that, if the first argument is correct, one consequence would be that legal practitioners may be able to contribute to the decongestion of the regular courts by a more frequent use of the power of the High Court to stay its proceedings and thus encourage the use of student courts to settle intra-union disputes."

"March 25, 2010","It is now increasingly acknowledged amongst both scholars and practitioners of international law that the international legal system posits a body of norms which constitute a collective barometer. This measure is useful in the evaluation of the legitimacy of governments and of governance. As the author has argued elsewhere, this barometer consists of minimum norms which favor popular participation in· governance, anti-genocide, anti-slavery, and anti-colonialism. Together these norms set a minimum standard for those who exercise political power in the domestic sphere."
"March 25, 2010","On 28 January 2008 the European Union launched the military operation EUFOR in Chad and the Central African Republic. Its mandate was to contribute to the security of the civilian population, the numerous refugees from neighbouring Darfur and the local presence of the United Nations. This paper describes and analyses the planning process of this operation at the political-strategic and military-strategic levels with the aim of understanding how the military instrument was intended to generate the desired political effects. The paper argues that, from a military perspective, the EUFOR operation is based on the concept of humanitarian deterrence: the threat of military force is used to discourage potential spoilers from targeting the civilian population. As with any military operation, the planning of EUFOR was plagued by various elements of friction. At least some of this friction seems to flow from the mismatch in expectations between the political-strategic and military-strategic levels. The various political and military-technical constraints within which the operation was planned resulted in an operational posture that is less decisive than what the political ambitions would have suggested."

First, the background on the area Tribal Nations’ territories will be detailed.  Second, the creation of the state of Idaho will be sketched within the framework of federal Indian law.  Third, the case law that has developed in Idaho and in the Pacific Northwest regarding the exercise of treaty hunting and fishing rights will be examined.  Next, the Rapid River case in Idaho in the late 1970s will serve as an illustration of this development.  In conclusion, the cooperation necessary for continued good relations between the Tribal Nations and the state of Idaho will be discussed."

"March 24, 2010","It has been speculated that the effects of sexual assault on victims are exacerbated by non-disclosure. It is therefore important to explore the reasons why survivors do not disclose or make formal reports. This chapter looks at  some of the factors that have stopped many survivors of sexual assault or exploitation by health professionals from reporting sexual assault. A sense of shame is the principal deterrent; this is coupled with other factors derived from the nature of the relationship – the inequality and trust inherent between the patient and practitioner and, in counselling contexts, possibly the added power inequity in transference. Those who do report may have an unsatisfactory experience as evidenced in an Australian case."

In the first place, laudable as it mostly is, the Suresh decision is based on a number of apparently credible, although flawed, images of certain important policy and doctrinal assumptions and constructs."
"March 24, 2010","This article seeks to show that both the conceptualization and practice of international human rights education within the mainstream human rights community has been shaped and framed, with mostly negative consequences, by at least three constitutive orthodoxies: a heaven-hell binary distinction between an all but ""perfect"" West and an all but ""hellish"" Third World; a consequent unidirectional traffic of human rights teaching from the West to the rest; and a reliance on the abolitionist paradigm of human rights education. It starts by mapping these orthodoxies, and proceeds thereafter to challenge them as fundamentally problematic and as capable of frustrating the project of progressive human rights education. The article ends by offering an insight into the ways in which international human rights education might be re-imagined if it is to have a better chance of achieving its ordinarily laudable mission."

Of all the existing approaches to the study of IHIs, constructivism comes the closest to accounting for the highly significant incidences of IHIjostered (and popular forces-facilitated) 'correspondence' that occurs outside the 'compliance radar'. In this sense the article is a contribution to the growing constructivist human rights and institutional literature sets. In particular"
"March 24, 2010","This Recent Development examines Moscow’s rationale for recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia and its potential application to other disputed post-Soviet territories. It argues that Russia’s recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia has extended the gray zone of partial recognition ushered in by Kosovo and has set the stage for a proliferation of ethnonationalist states. Russia’s rationale, using a similar logic to the case for Kosovo, lays bare the absence of consensus on the application of international law on separatism and self-determination of peoples to multiethnic, former Communist states."
"March 24, 2010","This paper attempts to answer the question of what made the Turkish threats in the 1998 October crisis with Syria different from all others made over the last two decades; and what were the main reasons for Hafez Assad’s capitulation vis-à-vis Turkish demands. Using the prospect theory, this paper argues that it was not the changing balance-of-power or the deterring effect of the Turkish-Israeli cooperation  that brought about Turkish resolve and Syrian capitulation at the end of the crisis, but Hafez Assad’s domestic policy constraints and health problems."
"March 24, 2010","We analyse the Swedish general elections that took place in spring and autumn 1887. Our aim is to discover which groups of voters were responsible for the severe losses that the supporters of free trade suffered in the second of these contests, and that allowed the protectionists to gain the majority in parliament and to initiate a new tariff policy. We find that while capital owners and wage earners consistently favoured free trade, in the spring election only the largest farmers supported protectionism. By autumn, political preferences among smallholders and middling farmers had shifted in favour of protectionism, too. As these groups were not specialised in the production of import competing goods, we assume that the political landslide in the autumn elections can be attributed to the influence of anti-free trade propaganda."

"March 23, 2010","The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program (AMP) has been identified as a model for natural resource management.  We challenge that assertion, citing the lack of progress toward a long-term management plan for the dam, sustained extra-programmatic conflict, and a downriver ecology that is still in jeopardy, despite over ten years of meetings and an expensive research program.  We have examined the primary and secondary sources available on the AMP’s design and operation in light of best practices identified in the literature on adaptive management and collaborative decision-making.  We have identified six shortcomings: (1) an inadequate approach to identifying stakeholders; (2) a failure to provide clear goals and involve stakeholders in establishing the operating procedures that guide the collaborative process; (3) inappropriate use of professional neutrals and a failure to cultivate consensus; (4) a failure to establish and follow clear joint fact-finding procedures; (5) a failure to produce functional written agreements; and (6) a failure to manage the AMP adaptively and cultivate long-term problem-solving capacity."

India witnessed the first genocide at the time of partition immediately after the independence. The two-nation theory led to the division of the country and the Hindus in India and Muslims in Bengal migrated to their destined homelands. In this process several lives were lost on both sides and women were kidnapped and raped and at times murdered. Kashmir is an unending and unresolved problem between both the nations. Razakar movement in the State of Hyderabad, the Mumbair riots, the annihilation of Sikhs after the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi and Godhra incidents are elaborately discussed.

"March 23, 2010","The U.S. and NATO justified their 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia and expulsion of Serb forces from Kosovo primarily on the grounds that their intervention was necessary to halt and reverse a humanitarian disaster, namely the Serbs widespread atrocities against and “ethnic cleansing” of the Albanian Kosovars. This article suggests and discusses some of the significant potential issues and problems raised by NATO’s Kosovo intervention – particularly for the UN and the doctrine of humanitarian intervention, but also for the laws of war, the role of international criminal courts, self-determination and ethnic conflict, and the role of the media and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)."
"March 23, 2010","Recent high-profile terrorism arrests and litigation in New York, Colorado, and Detroit have brought public attention to the question of how the government should respond to the possibility of domestic-origin terrorism linked to al Qaeda. This symposium essay identifies and discussing one emerging approach in the United States and Europe which attends to the process of terrorist “radicalization.” States on both sides of the Atlantic are investing increasingly in developing an epistemology of terrorist violence. The results have implications for how policing resources are allocated, whether privacy rights are respected, and how religious liberty may be exercised. This essay traces the development of state discourses on “radicalization” in the United States and the United Kingdom. It argues that understanding this new “radicalization” discourse entails attention to interactions between nations and between the federal government and states as well as to the political economy of counter-terrorism."
"March 22, 2010","This article analyses over 400 life trajectories of ordinary peasants in order to complement top-down studies of the Rwandan political transition. Changes and differences according to the ethnicity of the respondents shed light on the Hutu-Tutsi bi-polarity which underlies the transition and reveal a reversal in perceived ethnic dominance accompanying the decisive moment in the political transition: the overthrow of the Hutu-dominated regime by the Tutsi-led RPF. This suggests that the experience of the nature of governance and the (perceived) proximity to power lies at the heart of ethnic awareness. The nature of governance at the periphery of society is explored, and the article demonstrates that the instrumental stance on ethnic identity adopted by the post-genocide regime is not only erroneous but counter-productive. Adjusting the socio-political environment in which identities thrive is more important than a direct focus on identity constructs when developing policies to prevent ethnically structured violence."
"March 22, 2010","This paper will assess the existing perspectives on “new wars” in the literature. It will then analyze the degree to which contemporary wars are “new” by looking firstly at the changing nature of the state. It will not however support the view that state’s weakness is a structural cause of conflict but rather that it is a facilitator one. Finally, it will explore the degree to which globalization has impacted the role Romanian forces have to play in hotbeds such as Irak or Afghanistan. While engaging the existing literature, I argue that we must understand the “new wars” as an adapted form of engagement and not necessarily as a new breed of war."
"March 22, 2010","Sierra Leone’s conflict has often been characterized as a ‘crisis of youth’. For some, the post-war resurgence of grassroots associational life represents the unleashing of long-suppressed youth egalitarianism, yet this analysis tends to ignore the role of international aid in providing an economic incentive for impoverished Sierra Leoneans to embrace formal association. Case study evidence also shows that politics of ‘community’ identification and moral economies of patronage continue to affect post-war aid. Evidence of post-war social change can nevertheless be found outside the development sector. Diamond mining has long served as a driver of cultural modernization in Sierra Leone and detailed examination of post-war associational life in Kono District reveals that new foci and techniques of social activism have emerged since the end of the civil war. The decline of artisanal mining, with the expansion of large-scale industrial mining, and renewed interest in farming are driving a parallel resurgence of associational life in rural areas. Given that most Sierra Leoneans continue to depend on farming, this rural resurgence could yet represent the most durable basis for democratic change in Sierra Leone."
"March 22, 2010","Learning lessons from the experience of the International Criminal Court and the ad hoc tribunals, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon has tried to strike an interesting balance between the legitimate interests of victims on the one hand and the fairness and efficiency of the proceedings on the other. If victims can play a significant role at trial and on appeal, their voices can only be heard through legal representatives under the strict control of the judges. Moreover, victims are not allowed to intervene in the investigation and to make recommendations on the sentence to be imposed. However, some issues regarding the definition of victims are still unclear. Moreover, the proper functioning of the participation scheme rests entirely on the prosecutor, the judges and victims’ representatives, whose cooperative attitude and active role will be crucial."
"March 22, 2010","The paper studies in a simple, Downsian model of political competition how the private provision of public goods is affected when it is embedded in a system of democracy and redistributive taxation. Results show that the positive effect of inequality on public goods production, which Olson (1965) pointed to, is weakened and might even be reversed in this context. Also, the median voter may choose a negative tax rate, even if he is poorer than the mean, in order to stimulate public goods production. The relevance of the model is illustrated with an application to the finance of higher education."

In this context, both Muslim and Western statesmen and scholars have presented contradictory statements and opinions which have revolved around Huntington’s concept of ""clash of civilisations"". In the view of these differing opinions, the present study will carefully analyze the nature of ongoing relations between the East and West, and explain whether Islam poses an actual threat to the Western world beyond oft-repeated fictions and stereotypes. In contrast to Samuel Huntington's thesis, the paper will demonstrate that the fundamental source of conflict in the New World Order is still national interest and balance of power rather than cultural or religious differences, and this does not appear likely to change in a predictable future."
"March 22, 2010","Dual citizenship has become an unexceptional status in the wake of globalization yet remains at the sufferance of states. This essay advances the novel claim that dual citizenship should be protectable as a human right. In light of the threat that dual nationals once posed to stable bilateral relations, states were justified, historically, in suppressing the status. As that threat has dissipated, the values of freedom of association and liberal autonomy implied by citizenship ties should trump lingering state resistance. Failure to recognize the status also burdens the exercise of political rights by raising the cost of naturalization. Insofar as dual citizenship undermines state solidarities, that interest is too diffuse to justify nonapplication of associational and self-governance norms. There is growing evidence from state practice that dual citizenship is appropriately situated in a human rights framework."
"March 22, 2010","Social scientists and policy-makers are increasingly concerned with the civil society ability to influence the external policy of EU and the member states. This ability depends to a large extent on the capabilities and instruments of the non-governmental-organizations (NGOs), national and international associations, and lobbies, which represent civil society interests. In order to represent the demands that cut across the borders of states, NGOs are increasingly gaining access to international decision-making institutions. However, this access continues to face with the controversial issue of the NGOs engagement in political participation, representation, and democratization of the decision-making processes of international organizations. This paper aims at analyzing the increasing engagement of NGOs, within and in relation with the EU, in the framework of CFSP/ESDP, and in responding to composite humanitarian emergencies."
"March 22, 2010","The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture (SRT) is mandated to investigate and assess the situation of torture worldwide. He takes up complaints by torture victims and sends communications to Governments; he addresses specific factual and legal issues related to torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment and, most importantly; upon the invitation of Governments, he carries out fact-finding missions to specific countries. These country visits aim to establish a dialogue with the Government and to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in a given country. The preparation of a country visit may last up to several years, since sometimes long negotiations are necessary before a Government extends an invitation to the SRT accepting the SRT's terms of reference for fact-finding missions. These include full freedom of inquiry, unrestricted freedom of movement throughout the country as well as confidential interviews with victims, witnesses, human rights defenders, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Because torture takes place behind closed doors, torture fact-finding and the assessment of the general conditions of detention require unannounced visits to places of detention and individual and confidential interviews with persons deprived of their liberty. It is essential that interviews with detainees only take place with their informed consent and that necessary precautionary measures against reprisals are taken. The mission reports that are drafted on the basis of information received from the Government, NGOs, lawyers, and detainees are presented and discussed in the Human Rights Council. The SRT's recommendations included in the report should help the Government in its efforts to eradicate torture in the respective country. Additionally, the reports are essentially background materials for the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council and can serve as an important advocacy tool for NGOs and other actors."

"March 22, 2010","Recent years have seen notable progress on issues of gender and human rights in standard-setting and to some extent application of those standards through international and domestic legislation and jurisprudence, and in institutional programming and development. Some international and regional human rights bodies now go beyond just including ‘women’ in a list of ‘vulnerable’ groups, and have begun to incorporate women's experiences and perspectives into recommendations for structural changes needed to bring about full enjoyment of human rights by women and girls. In addition, recent years have seen the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people being taken up beyond the first human rights bodies that addressed them, and developments have taken place in standard-setting. Despite this progress, many challenges remain. Violence against women continues at a staggering rate. Gender-based discrimination persists in the workplace, housing, education, disaster relief, health care, and countless other areas. Access to justice continues to be hindered by a range of obstacles. Religion, tradition, and culture continue to be used as a shield for violating women's rights. Same-sex conduct is still criminalized in scores of countries, and it carries the death penalty in seven states. The traditional human rights law paradigm, with its focus on the state, may be obsolete in dealing with human rights abuses by such diverse non-state actors as powerful militias and global corporations. This article highlights just a few opportunities and challenges to come for international human rights advocacy on gender issues."
"March 22, 2010","For an agrarian country like Ethiopia, land has always been considered to have social, cultural and economic value, not to mention its political value. The state-owned tenure system has been constitutionally entrenched since the 1975 land reform legislation.  Whether or not such tenure structure best guarantees the interests of farmers from the human rights point of view has not been adequately examined. Moreover, the very fact of addressing land rights from the human rights perspective is in itself a neglected topic that requires scrutiny."
"March 22, 2010","Human rights and development continue to reflect a separate evolution. This article explores challenges which characterize the relationship between human rights and development from a legal perspective suggesting reasons why the tensions and disconnects endure. It makes an obvious, but nevertheless underappreciated point: human rights are the subject of binding international legal obligations and their relevance to development can be understood in light of this. The first part of this article addresses the challenges of integrating human rights in development and the divergences of discourse and policy frameworks. The consequences of these divergences are examined, including a lack of prominence for legal duties for human rights in development, the absence of a normative baseline against which to check development processes and outcomes, an overall lack of policy coherence and a potential undermining of human rights accountability. The article concludes by highlighting opportunities extant in the international human rights law framework. The legal challenges and opportunities are viewed as interconnected: obstacles confronted in integrating human rights in development may be to be rooted in a neglect of the normative and legal dimensions of human rights, which in turn point to opportunities for greater convergence and coherence around international legal frameworks."
"March 22, 2010","On 21 January the Palestinian Minister of Justice lodged with the ICC Registrar a ‘Declaration Recognizing the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court’ over acts committed on the territory of Palestine since 2002. This article concerns three issues regarding the admissibility of this declaration, all of which are linked to the question of statehood. It first argues that the ICC Prosecutor may not assume the existence of a Palestinian state because the Palestinians themselves do not make a claim to that effect. It then examines whether under a purposive interpretation of Article 12(3), declarations should also be admitted from quasi-states. Finally, it examines the consequences of the ICC Prosecutor engaging in questions concerning statehood and recognition."
"March 22, 2010","On 8 April 2009, Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court issued a decision on the participation of ‘indirect victims’ in the Lubanga case. The thorny question scrutinized by the Trial Chamber was whether applicants who allegedly suffered harm as a result of crimes committed by child soldiers might be considered ‘indirect victims’ of the case. After presenting a critical analysis of the decision, this article submits that the notion of ‘indirect victim’ in Lubanga should include the persons harmed by the conduct of direct victims (i.e. the child soldiers), provided that such conduct is causally linked to the charges against the accused. Accepting such a broad notion of ‘indirect victim’ would not hinder the rights of the accused, while taking into account the specificity of the crime of conscripting, enlisting or using child soldiers."
"March 22, 2010","This article examines the dominant perceptions of war crimes trials among victims from Prijedor, a municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Largely based on interviews with victims who have testified in trials before international, state and district courts, and victims who have never testified, non-governmental organization activists working with victims in their communities, and some professionals involved in Prijedor-related cases, the article attempts to cast new light on the factors which create and shape these perceptions. Considering the nature of the violence experienced by the community in question and the relatively substantive judicial response to it, the Prijedor case offers insights relevant to similar communities around the world and important lessons for courts and tribunals seeking to ensure that their work is capable of providing some sense of justice to victims."
"March 22, 2010","In May 2008, South Africa witnessed two shocking weeks of deadly attacks on foreigners and other suspect outsiders. This article makes sense of the violence with reference to an extended history of South African statecraft that both induced the conflict and hamstrung efforts to address it. In particular, it describes how decades of discursive and institutional efforts to control political and physical space have generated two demons with which the country must now contend. The first is a perceived enemy within: an amorphously delimited group of outsiders that is inherently threatening, often indistinguishable from others, and effectively impossible to exclude spatially. The second demon rests in a society prepared to kill to rid itself of those retarding the country’s post-Apartheid renaissance. For many of those behind the attacks or empathizing with them, controlling the movement of people within the country and across its borders remains essential to security, prosperity, and South Africa’s national self-realization. Political leaders now face a dilemma: extending legal identities and constitutionally promised protections to outsiders and other foreigners risks being seen as betraying the national project by the demonic and visibly violent society they have helped create."
"March 22, 2010","Through two interwoven sections, this paper explores some empirical dimensions and theoretical challenges related to the granting of electoral rights to resident non-nationals by states and by the European Union. The objective is to develop approaches to models of membership that, in turn, enrich citizenship studies in the European Union context, offering an approach to studying EU citizenship firmly rooted in national constitutional discourses and practices. The focus in the first section is on electoral rights granted to EU citizens under article 19 EC, which allow the nationals of member states to vote in European Parliament and local elections when resident in a host member state, under the same conditions as nationals. We then explore in the second section some membership models that suggest how member states could develop defensible approaches to the challenges of determining the boundaries of the franchise in the complex multilevel Euro-polity."
"March 22, 2010","In the immediate post-liberation period, Eritrean intellectuals, with the concurrence of the state, showed deep interest in developing archaeological studies and an enhanced capacity to manage heritage resources. Through a focus on the National Museum, this article investigates the ensuing struggles for the control of history and heritage in Eritrea. Originally an initiative of ex-fighters who rendered liberation history in artistic form, the National Museum later came under the authority of the University of Asmara. While other museums involving those who survived displacement and conflict, such as the District Six Museum in Cape Town, often contest the expert authority of intellectuals and invite public participation, the National Museum became an instrument of the state that suppressed public participation. The struggle between the National Museum and the University provides penetrating insights into state hostility towards intellectuals and containment of public education using the media of archaeology and heritage studies, a conflict that prefigured state/university conflicts leading to the dismantling of the University of Asmara."
"March 22, 2010","Recent judgments of the Special Court for Sierra Leone comprise the most significant judicial consideration of collective punishment by an international court since the trials conducted after the Second World War. The Special Court’s conviction of several individuals for the war crime of collective punishment are the first of their kind, although at times the judgments involved strained judicial reasoning on the meaning, scope and rationale of the war crime of collective punishment. In considering the status of collective punishment as an international crime, the author draws on the Special Court’s jurisprudence and explores the customary and conventional law basis of the war crime of collective punishment and the challenge of defining the elements of such a crime. The omission of the war crime of collective punishment from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court questions the place of the offence in contemporary international criminal law, particularly in light of the possibility that underlying acts might be adequately addressed by other established war crimes."
"March 22, 2010","The article examines the 2009 decision of the United Kingdom High Court of Justice to deny the extradition of four genocide suspects to Rwanda owing to fair trial and partiality concerns with the Rwandan judiciary. It begins by reviewing the relevant UK extradition legislation, the pertinent facts and the rationale for the judgment and proceeds to situate this decision within the broader transnational judicial scepticism about the extradition or transfer of genocide suspects to Rwanda. While this scepticism arises from valid concerns regarding the contemporary state of human rights in Rwanda, it nevertheless contributes to the perpetuation of impunity surrounding massive historical violations of human rights in the country. This article also enquires about appropriate burdens of proof when extraditing individuals accused of extraordinary international crimes, the importability of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda referral judgments into the context of inter-state extradition, and the relationship between international human rights law and transitional justice."
"March 22, 2010","The article deals with some of the new legal issues arising in the Mrkšić et al. Appeal Judgment, with particular regard to the responsibility of the accused Veselin Šljivančanin for his role in the attack against Croat prisoners of war (POWs) that occurred in Ovčara, Croatia, in 1991. The ICTY Appeals Chamber shed light on the nature and scope of the individual duty to protect POWs under Articles 12 and 13 of Geneva Convention III and held that an agent of the Detaining Power entrusted with custody and control over POWs is under the duty to ensure their safe transfer even when he no longer has custody and control over them. In convicting Šljivančanin for his failure to protect the POWs, the Appeals Chamber also clarified the elements of aiding and abetting by omission. However, the Appeals Chamber’s failure both to characterize the armed conflict in Croatia and to clarify on what legal grounds the captured Croats were entitled to POW status is open to criticism."
"March 22, 2010","In these closing remarks I want to highlight three paradoxes of mutual recognition that emerge from this excellent set of contributions on mutual recognition. The first relates to the underlying theme of this volume: although mutual recognition is prima facie a conflicts rule, such a rule entails, in fact, a process of social decision-making that is best described as a form of governance. The second paradox is that, albeit presented as an instrument to promote integration while preserving diversity and the states' regulatory autonomy, mutual recognition has an important impact on states' sovereignty. Finally, the last paradox emerging from the different contributions arises from the relationship established between mutual recognition and mutual trust. Such a relationship highlights the extent to which the recognition of diversity entailed in mutual recognition actually depends on a certain degree of common identity, as only the latter can provide the basis for the mutual trust necessary to implement mutual recognition. None of these paradoxes necessarily challen es mutual recognition and its potential for application in different policy areas of integration. They allow us, however, to identify some usually hidden assumptions and processes of decision-making inherent in mutual recognition. This will, in turn, allow us to make a better normative judgement of its potential benefits and shortcomings in different policy areas."
"March 22, 2010","The rapid intensification of the conflict in Sri Lanka during the mid-1980s followed the July 1983 communal violence. Agents of the state perpetrated human rights violations, including attempts at demographic transformation through massacres and the displacement of minority Tamils. The accompanying rise of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam through the brutal elimination of rivals brought another dimension to the conflict. Conventional human rights work, which dealt exclusively with the State, distorted the problem. The new totalitarian cult of the hero within a disillusioned Tamil society portended internal terror, recruitment of women and children, debasement of its own civilians in peace and war, and a barbarous approach to civilians from other communities. Amidst the devastation of 1987, a group of academics from the University of Jaffna, drawing on wider discussion within the community, wrote the Broken Palmyra in a bid to tell the whole truth and challenge the fatal trend. Through this experience, the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) [UTHR(J)] was born. Its reports have endeavoured to expose and challenge all perpetrators of abuses irrespective of affiliation. Its members also engaged with the university community and those outside against violence, whether out of narrow ideologies or sheer anger. The risk was knowingly taken and Dr Rajani Thiranagama, a leading member, paid with her life. Throughout its 20 years, UTHR(J) has challenged peace activity that privileged ‘peace’ over human rights, whose culmination was the recent Sri Lankan peace process with Norwegian facilitation. Both sides had powerful camps with fixed ideological obsessions, which either tried to manipulate the peace process or exploited its vulnerabilities to go on the rampage. The combined effect discredited the process and strengthened extremism on both sides. The collapse of the process owed to a theoretical aversion to mechanisms that pose a strong deterrence against human rights abuse by any party. The Sri Lankan experience is a further warning that a peace process that fails to advance human rights is doomed."
"March 22, 2010","This paper examines the judicial construction of jurisdiction over Maori in the 1840s in New Zealand. Using new data, including case material and extra-judicial commentary, it examines the first decisions by the New Zealand Supreme Court on crime between Maori (crime ‘inter se’). In so doing, it briefly places New Zealand in a broader context of settler colonies, and considers how colonial judges (such as Chapman J. of the Supreme Court of New Zealand) fashioned the common law to fit the contingency of local circumstance, thereby playing their part in constituting local sovereignty. Finally, the article also considers the reaction of settlers to Maori crime and these decisions."
"March 22, 2010","Many of the legal campaigns against governmental practices and policies in large-scale human-rights abusing regimes are waged ‘internally’, through the regime's own institutions. Such litigations raise serious dilemmas for human rights lawyers and for human rights organizations. This essay is an attempt to dig out the implications of these internal legal struggles, whatever their effectiveness, for the project of bringing an end to the human rights abusing regime. The essay analyzes 35 years of ongoing, occupation-related human rights litigation in the Israeli court as a generic example of a massive ‘internal’ legal opposition. The author of this essay, an Israeli lawyer, involved in such litigations, reaches a painful conclusion: although internal legal action might ease human sufferings in individual cases, it nevertheless potentially empowers the regime and contributes to its sustainability."
"March 22, 2010","For too long victims have been neglected in international criminal law; with the adoption of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Statute they have, however, been granted a set of procedural rights that entitles them to some form of participation in international criminal proceedings. Arguably there is nothing prejudicial per se to the rights of the accused in allowing victims to participate in international criminal proceedings. Unfortunately, however, the ambiguities of the ICC Statute, the lack of clarity as to the procedural model, and the absence of clear cut provisions in the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence (RPE) have created a legal framework which is flawed with regard to the principle of legal certainty and, at least in this respect, clearly amounts to a violation of the rights of the accused. Against this background, the judges are solely responsible for finding the appropriate way to enable some measure of victim participation consistent with the rights of the accused. According to the Statute, any balancing between these two competing interests must be premised on the primacy of the rights of the accused. The practice of ICC Chambers, however, suggests that the judges are hesitant explicitly to recognize the primacy of such rights. This reluctance may lead in some instances (e.g. the broad definition of victims; permission for the presentation of evidence by victims; the acceptance of the double status as victim and as witness; and so on) to weaken the protection of the rights of the accused due to a mistaken interpretation of the right of victims to obtain justice."
"March 22, 2010","The pivotal argument of this paper is that states and political establishments develop two types of identities: self-identity and sub-identity. Mutually corresponding sub-identities are the medium through which states interact. The first part of the paper argues that each state allocates a unique sub-identity to every other individual state or political establishment with whom it engages in a relationship. Particularly, a shift from war to peace requires states to reconcile their respective sub-identities towards their enemies. However, reconciliation is not a straightforward transition from an antagonistic mood to a pacifist environment. It is only possible if psychological barriers are overcome. The second part of this paper is devoted to a diagnosis of the psychological barriers that have prevented Israel from successfully reconciling its sub-identity with the Palestinian establishment."
"March 22, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to test an international oil and gas market model, hypothesised to arrive at new indicator of pure composite political risk for country oil and gas sectors. Current political risk ratings are largely subjectively quantified and are not frequently published. Investors in oil and gas industry portfolios as well as trade and investment policy formulators should be interested that there is a strong theoretical and practical basis where pure political risk indicators may be obtained daily rather than monthly using stock market generated data. A systemic international capital asset pricing model is a useful framework as long as available financial and economic information is captured along with systemic interdependence and control introduced for country size and wealth effects. If so, an indication of the influence of human (political) factors in each country oil and gas industry sector can be provided."
"March 22, 2010","This article examines the emerging practice on victims' claims for reparation in the context of international criminal proceedings. International criminal courts have followed the model of domestic jurisdictions allowing criminal courts to order compensation by the convicted person to the victim. Yet, remedies for victims in domestic criminal courts function far from optimally. Domestic courts face various problems, relating to technical questions of civil law concerning applicable law, evidence and statute of limitation. These civil law problems often prevent domestic criminal courts from ordering compensation, referring victims to civil courts instead to obtain reparation. The question arises how international criminal courts handle the obstacles inherent in civil law claims that are examined during criminal proceedings."
"March 21, 2010","This paper examines concepts of harm (damage, negative impact or consequences) arising from organised crime (OC) in the international, British and Dutch literatures. The context is policy makers’ interest in clarifying priorities for action through the criminal justice system, administrative measures and/or private sector partners. The paper concludes that prioritisation should depend not only on where the harm is greatest, but also on the extent to which of the responses/measures available to the public-private partners are capable of significantly reducing the harms (this is the question of effectiveness, efficiency, added value, or ‘amenability’ – the practical potential for harm reduction). Putting together these two overarching considerations, one arrives at the idea: Rating of harms x Rating of the effectiveness of actions = Justification for action. (The authors acknowledge that, in formulating priorities for action, the authorities may also have additional, policy-related considerations, however those are outside the ambit of this paper, which covers only ‘technical’ issues.) What then is harm, what is effectiveness, and how can they be ‘rated’? This paper identifies three distinct aspects of harm: (i) ‘hurts’ to victims (in a wide variety of social positions); (ii) ‘threat’ to the capabilities and integrity of ‘guardians’ (all public officials and private sector professionals who have roles in relation to the prevention and control of OC); and (iii) potential for ‘systemic damage’ (for example, undermining economic stability). Since harm types (i), (ii) and (iii) generally cannot be measured quantitatively in terms of one common metric (such as financial costs), qualitative assessment should be adopted. A common framework for comparison of harms may be provided by scales, running from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest conceivable), doing this separately for hurts to victims, for threat to guardians, and for potential systemic damage. Only direct forms of harm should be considered – not indirect or response costs – since inclusion of the latter leads to circularity (spending yet more on what we have spent most upon in the past). Only tangible harms should be included (not so-called ‘intangible harms’, such as reputational damage of a person, firm, enforcement agency or country). Reasons include the consideration that such harms result from social reaction to criminal acts, rather than from the criminality per se. Also, some intangibles are found to be sites of deep social conflict, so evaluating them cannot be done without ‘taking sides’. As for effectiveness/amenability, it is suggested that prosecutors, police and others should asked to identify those measures that are seen to most strongly reduce the harms that are of greatest concern. In order to operationalise this harm effectiveness framework, more work is needed on harm and also on effectiveness/amenability. In summary, in order to prioritise cases, expert judgement will be needed on which of the available actions (of the criminal justice systems and administrative and private sector partners) have the best prospects for reducing each aspect of harm. This study was financially supported by the Ministry of Justice, The Hague, The Netherlands, and can also be found on the website of the WODC (Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek- en Documentatiecentrum)."
"March 21, 2010","The absence of significant and tangible military defensive infrastructure on the Eastern flank generated over time a breach of credibility in the security guarantee provided by NATO under its Article 5 commitment. The main argument of the countries in the New Europe now is that, in order to be credible enough, and not just a paper guarantee, a collective defence commitment must be backed by “boots on the ground” and by military tangible logistics. While assuming this perspective, the present article looks at some of the alarm signals coming from the countries on NATO’s Eastern flank, trying to explain the feeling of insecurity perceived by the states in the region as well as the options available to the Euro-Atlantic community in order to engage in a much-needed process of strategic reassurance."
"March 19, 2010","In countries around the world it is common practice for victims of human trafficking who have been rescued or who have escaped from situations of exploitation to be placed and detained in public or private shelters. In the most egregious situations, victims can be effectively imprisoned in such shelters for months, even years. The article, a revised and updated version of a study released by ARTIP in 2008, uses field-based research to document this largely unreported phenomenon. It then considers the international legal aspects of victim detention in shelters, and weighs up the common justifications for such detention from legal, policy and practical perspectives."
"March 18, 2010","This paper explores the situation of women returning to their homes and communities after their countries have experienced major conflicts.  In that context, it assesses the range of barriers and challenges that women face and offers some thinking to addresses and remedy these complex issues.  As countries face the transition process, they can begin to measure the conflict’s impact on the population and the civil infrastructure.  Not only have people been displaced from their homes, but, typically, health clinics, schools, roads, businesses, and markets have deteriorated substantially.  While the focus is on humanitarian aid in the midst of and during the immediate aftermath, the focus turns to development-based activities for the longer-term."
"March 18, 2010","An ongoing debate persists among legal scholars and practitioners about whether torture should be allowed in exceptional 'ticking-bomb' cases. This article describes the more general legal context in which this debate has evolved, as well as the arguments raised on both sides. Starting with a short presentation of the international human rights law framework regarding the prohibition of torture, this article analyses the most gripping arguments of the opposing camps in the 'ticking-bomb' debate and explains how they comport with the international law requirements for the protection of human rights. Finally, the article analyses the existing case law dealing with the question of permissibility of torture in exceptional ‘ticking-bomb’ situations, in order to demonstrate which of the two opposing camps have the courts opted for in deciding those cases."
"March 18, 2010","This study provides empirical support for recent theoretical models that allow for time-varying rare disaster risk. Using a unique database of 447 international political crises during the period 1918–2006, we create a crisis index that shows substantial variation over time. We show that changes in this crisis index, our proxy for changes in perceived disaster probability, have a statistically significant and economically large impact on both the mean and volatility of world stock market returns. World markets react more strongly when crises are more severe and when there is more at stake due to the involvement of major powers. Using predictive regressions, there is no significant relation between crisis risk and future market returns, however crisis risk is positively correlated with the earnings-price ratio and the dividend yield. Cross-sectional tests provide further support for the hypothesis that crisis risk is priced: US industries with higher crisis risk sensitivity generate a higher excess return. Our crisis measures also correlate negatively with U.S. consumer confidence and GDP-growth forecasts, both proxies for expected U.S. consumption growth."
"March 17, 2010","Stabilizing and liberalizing policies are key elements of the Washington Consensus. This paper adds a historical dimension to the ongoing debate by assessing the economic impact of market-oriented reforms undertaken during General Francos dictatorship, the 1959 Stabilization and Liberalization Plan. Using an index of macroeconomic distortions (IMD) the relationship between economic policies and the growth record is examined. Although a gradual reduction in macroeconomic distortions was already in motion during the 1950s, the 1959 Plan opened the way to a new institutional design that favoured a free-market allocation of resources and allowed Spain to accelerating growth and catching up with Western Europe. Without the 1959 Plan, per capita GDP would have been significantly lower in 1975."
"March 17, 2010","Much of the research on ethnicity, development and conflict implicitly assumes that ethnic groups act collectively in pursuit of their interests. Collective political action is typically facilitated by political parties able to make credible commitments to pursue group interests. Other work, however, emphasizes the lack of political credibility as a source of adverse development outcomes. Evidence presented here uses partisan preferences across 16 Sub-Saharan African countries to distinguish these positions. The evidence is inconsistent with the credibility of party commitments to pursue collective ethnic interests: ethnic clustering of political support is less widespread than expected; members of clustered ethnic groups exhibit high rates of partisan disinterest and are only slightly more likely to express a partisan preference; and partisan preferences are more affected by factors, such as gift-giving, often associated with low political credibility. These findings emphasize the importance of looking beyond ethnicity in analyses of economic development."
"March 16, 2010","Bangladesh, a poor and small country in South Asia, was separated from Pakistan in 1971 following a nine-month long violent war. Replacing the religious basis of Pakistan state, Bangladesh movement was advanced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami League on the basis of secularism, Bengali nationalism, democracy, and socialism. But soon Mujib's secularism was challenged by Islamist militias, Bengali nationalism by non-Bengali ethnic militias, and socialism by left-wing militias. Being puzzled and disturbed by many-sided attacks, Mujib declared a one-party dictatorship as a 'second revolution' to curb the biting forces and rebuild the nation, which ultimately culminated into his assassination in August 1975. The subsequent periods in Bangladesh history are marked with coups and counter coups, military dictatorships, political and civil assassinations as well as resistance movements. The Islamist militias again started fighting for establishing an Islamic rule in the country, ethnic militias for their rights of self-determination and preservation of identity, and left-wing militias for a revolutionary transformation of the society. Encountering these Islamist, ethnic and left-wing militias, Bangladesh's democracy is as if moving one step forward and two steps back. This paper traces various militia ideologies in Bangladesh to understand the issues concerning rebellion and resistance."
"March 15, 2010","I present a theory of the emergence and evolution of governance, conceived as the process through which the rules systems in place in any social setting are adapted to the needs of those who live under them. The theory is composed of three elements: normative structure, dyadic contracting, and triadic dispute resolution. I demonstrate that amove to triadic dispute resolution leads the triadic dispute resolver to construct, and then to manage over time, specific causal relationships between exchange, conflict, and rules. In this way, political life is judicialized."
"March 15, 2010","Most people are caring and will exert great effort to reserve ""the one"" whose needy plight comes to their attention. But these same people often become numbly indifferent to the plight of ""the one"" who is one of many in a much greater problem."
"March 15, 2010","Most people are caring and will exert great effort to rescue individual victims whose needy plight comes to their attention. These same good people, however, often become numbly indifferent to the plight of individuals who are ""one of many"" in a much greater problem. Why does this occur? The answer to this question will help us answer a related question that is the topic of this paper: Why, over the past century, have good people repeatedly ignored mass murder and genocide? Every episode of mass murder is unique and raises unique obstacles to intervention. But the repetitiveness of such atrocities, ignored by powerful people and nations, and by the general public, calls for explanations that may reflect some fundamental deficiency in our humanity - a deficiency that, once identified, might possibly be overcome."
"March 14, 2010","Contemporary research on roadblocks and facilitators of settlement has thus far been framed by standard economic modeling and distributive bargaining theories.  Each of these frameworks provides helpful insights into those elements that assist or hinder the settlement process. However, each of these models has thus far not examined how particular roadblocks and facilitators of settlement operate in the context of international commercial arbitration proceedings from a comparative cross cultural perspective. How diverse regions approach roadblocks and facilitators of settlement in the context of the integration of global markets is a new arena for research and practice. To date, most research on international arbitration has focused exclusively on Western models of arbitration as practiced in Europe and North America. While such studies accurately reflected the geographic foci of international arbitration practice in the mid-20th century, in recent years, the number of international arbitrations conducted in East Asia has grown steadily and on par with growth in Western regions. This article presents a cross cultural examination of how international arbitrators in East Asian and Western countries view the particular factors that help or hinder the settlement process in international arbitration. The result of a 115 person survey and 64 follow up interviews shed light on the underlying cultural attitudes and approaches to perceived roadblocks and facilitators of settlement in international arbitration. The findings indicate that arbitration practitioner’s perceptions of the factors influencing the achievement of settlement as well as specific barriers to settlement demonstrate a high degree of convergence across regions. At the same time, regional and socio-economic distinctions are reflected in varying arbitrator perceptions regarding arbitrator proclivity toward making the first move toward settlement in arbitration, the degree of focus on past facts and legal rights as opposed to exploring creative solutions and orientation toward adversarial procedures."
"March 14, 2010","This paper discusses the problem of paramilitary violence in Colombia and its effects on democracy. The elections were part of the purpose of self defense and constituted a disguised form to retain its drug trafficking economy. The impacts on institutional technology have been negative: representative democracy, the electoral system and voting, they were not the same. With paramilitary violence changed the electoral map in areas contested by the traditional political parties. Voting with paramilitary preferences mean the biggest challenge is constitutional democracy in Colombia."
"March 13, 2010","Mediation is mostly treated apart from other approaches to dealing with violent conflicts, especially when dealing with conflict in which one or both parties deny the legitimacy of an overarching sovereign authority. This is the case in most violent conflicts in Soutehast Asia which are overwhelmingly ethnic in nature and usually pit a group fighting against the central government. This paper treats mediation as just one tool in a wider set of approaches to dealing with so called ""intractable-conflicts"" and shows how mediation can and should be integrated so as to achieve the synergy and momentum necessary to deal with the many obstacles to along term settlement of a dispute. The concept of Human Security as well as of the REsponsibility to Protect (R2P) are used as overarching theoretical frameworks necessary in order to achieve not only negative but also positive peace. An approach to mediation resembling lederach's ""elicitive model"" and Burton's problem solving workshops are recommended as important tools in a concerted and holistic effort to move an intractable conflict towards settlement and sustainable peace. Examples are used throughout the paper from Southeast Asia's many intractable conflicts such as the one in Indonesia between the government and the pan-Islamic movement Jemaah Islamiya (JI), the Muslim nationalist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) fighting for independence in the Philippines, and the Southern Muslim insurgency in Thailand fighting for an Independent Greater Patani."
"March 13, 2010","The literature on institutional determinants of intra‐state violence commonly asserts that the presence of multiple political parties reduces the conflict potential within countries; by co‐opting oppositional groups into an institutionalized political arena, dissidents would prefer parliamentarian means over violent rebellion in order to pursue their goals. The present paper shows that this proposition does not necessarily hold for fuel‐abundant states. In the presence of natural resources such as oil or gas, countries exhibiting numerous non‐competitive parties are actually more susceptible to internal conflict. Fortified by the establishment of legal political parties, regime opponents succumb more easily to the prospects of securing resource revenues, adopting rapacious behaviour. Fuel‐related internal grievances as well as the opposition’s disaffection over the lack of effective political leverage and government use of political violence provide a seemingly legitimate motive for armed rebellion. Moreover, financial means for insurgency are raised by extortion or the possibility of selling future exploitation rights to natural resources. Logit models using different estimation techniques and alternative operationalizations corroborate the proposed claim. The argumentation is further illustrated by a depiction of the Colombian case."
"March 13, 2010","The increasing involvement of international actors in various forms of international missions set up to supervise reconstruction or peace-building processes has raised many questions with respect to both the legal framework applicable to such activity and the authority to engage in such reforms. Recently, new normative propositions on the subject have been labelled jus post bellum. This Article challenges the usefulness and accuracy of jus post bellum as a legal concept. Such theories either amount to an explicit or implicit challenge of the crucial objectivity of the post-conflict phase by linking the rights and obligations of foreign actors to the legality of the use of force, or they simply bring together previously existing obligations."
"March 12, 2010","The paper advances an understanding of responsible leadership as a political conception and offers an agenda for future research in this field. Our conceptualization of responsible leadership draws on deliberative practices and discursive conflict resolution, combining the macro-view of the business firm as a political actor with the micro-view of leadership. We discuss the concept in relation to existing leadership concepts (e.g. authentic, ethical, transformational, servant leadership). Further, we propose antecedents, outcomes and moderators that can affect or are affected by such an understanding of responsible leadership."
"March 12, 2010","A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their harmful consequences. To help society prevent or mitigate damage from catastrophes, immense effort and technological sophistication are often employed to assess and communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses. This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting numbers and act on them appropriately."
"March 11, 2010","This study examines the interaction between religion and politics in Sri Lanka.  Existing scholarly studies on Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict largely address the ethnic dimension of the conflict.  Indeed, in the understanding of Sri Lanka’s 25-year civil war, which has left 70,000 dead and displaced nearly a half-million people at its height generally, religion is rarely identified as having any role. But there is a point on the other side – what this study identifies as the religious factor."
"March 11, 2010","This paper speculates about the political system for the state of Palestine. The point of departure is the Palestinian Authority, in control, since 1994, of parts of the occupied Palestinian territory. Without underestimating other possible factors, this paper argues that the failure of the Palestinian Authority, the blockage of its political system, and the inability of the institutions and mechanisms established by the Basic Law to resolve conflicts between political actors and branches of government, is related to structural deficiencies of the form of government."
"March 10, 2010","This chapter begins by setting out the “promise of globalisation”, that is to say the purported benefits for human rights from the process of globalisation, as a starting point for the broader discussion which will follow. We then take one step back, as it were, to get a clearer analytical understanding of what exactly “globalisation” is, by examining alternative approaches to defining globalisation. Then, with the benefit of greater definitional clarity, the remainder of the chapter is devoted to a consideration of the actual impact which globalisation has had on human rights to date; before then drawing some conclusions as to the potential long-term implications of globalisation for human rights, and the obstacles and opportunities which globalisation presents for the realisation of human rights."
"March 10, 2010","The threat of global infectious agents has the potential to cripple national and global economies, as the outbreaks of SARS, Avian Flu, H1N1, and XDR-TB have demonstrated. This article offers a root cause analysis (RCA) of one public health case study (Speaker case of XDR-TB), pinpointing the underlying causal relationships associated with this global health problem and proposing recommendations for preventing its recurrence. An RCA approach identifies corrective actions directed at the root causes of the problem and advances them as necessary to eliminate global contagion with its major international public health risks. To my knowledge, this is the first root cause analysis of a global health problem. The reform this article proposes would be to add a standardized procedure akin to the informed consent process in clinical ethics, but within a shared health governance model. This approach, addressing infectious agents at their origins or source, is a more effective strategy to reduce uncertainty and avert global health threats."
"March 10, 2010","A large body of scholarship finds that there is a relationship between reliance on natural resources and authoritarianism. Extant cross-country findings are derived, however, from panel regressions that assume random effects, where the dataset’s time dimension is relatively short. Because natural resource reliance is not an exogenous variable that is randomly assigned, this is not an effective strategy to uncover causal relationships. Indeed, numerous sources of bias may be driving the results, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced by the time-invariant differences between countries. We therefore develop unique historical datasets, employ time-series centric techniques, and operationalize explicitly specified counterfactuals. This allows us properly test for long-run relationships between resource reliance and regime type within countries over time, therefore allowing us to minimize the sources of bias that beset the extant literature. Our results indicate that increases in resource reliance are not associated with the undermining of democracy, or less complete transitions from authoritarianism to democracy.  If anything, in many specifications we generate results that suggest a resource blessing."
"March 10, 2010","This article deals with accountability in the context of the Srebrenica genocide. It looks at various ways in which accountability is - or can be - established for violations of human rights committed by the main perpetrators, the state, and the United Nations and its organs. To hold the main perpetrators accountable for their actions in Srebrenica and the rest of the former Yugoslavia, the UN set up the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The International Court of Justice recently addressed questions of state responsibility in relation to the genocide of Srebrenica. The UN sent peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) to restore peace and security in the region. Both UNPROFOR and the ICTY have since been accused of human rights violations. At the moment, various individuals are attempting to hold the UN accountable for various acts and omissions, including in relation to Srebrenica. The International Law Commission is working on the legal rules governing the responsibility of international organizations, and the political organs of the United Nations are considering possible accountability mechanisms. All of this is very much work in progress: for the time being the accountability for human rights violations by international organizations is the least developed of all accountability mechanisms."
"March 09, 2010","Any specific legal provisions on nuclear third party liability are absenting in the Euratom Law at the time. Consequently, the legal framework for nuclear third party liability in the Member States remains governed by the particular international convention in force (in cases the member state is a Contracting Party of any of them), by the national nuclear liability legislation in force respectively. But most currently, the discussion on nuclear liability harmonisation has been opened also on the EU level. While silent on this issue during the decades after signing the Euratom Treaty in 1957, the attitude of the EU institutions (the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Commission in particular) towards regulating the nuclear liability in the Euratom Law changed dramatically after the 2004 and 2008 enlargements. Discussion on nuclear liability “patchwork situation” was opened under the aegis of the European Commission already in 2005, but it then it was paralysed because of the strict resistance of the new Central- and Eastern European member states. On the occasion of the AIDN/INLA biannual meeting hold in Brussels in September 2007, EC Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs pointed out current situation in the area of nuclear liability framework in the EC/Euratom, which was described as very unsatisfactory from the EC Commissions’ point of view. Commissioner Piebalgs announced a further activity of the European Communities towards harmonising nuclear liability regime. Some months later, in December 2007, the European Commission commissioned a Spanish Law Firm to develop and distribute a questionnaire to explore the views of EU states and of EU industry on the current nuclear liability situation with the view to harmonizing that field of law within the EU and to evaluate their results gained by the questionnaire. In this questionnaire, as one of the options, issuing a Nuclear Liability Directive under the Euratom Treaty was identified. This paper deals with the question, if Euratom has competence to issue a Directive like this and what kind of consequences it may have towards the existing multilateral frameworks."
"March 09, 2010","Many argue that the Article 9 pacificim clause in the Japanese constitution is an impediment to Japan assuming its rightful place in the world's current power structure as it unduly restricts the deployment capabilities of Japanese armed forces.  But until Japan adequately atones for the wartime atrocities it committed half a century ago, the geopolitical provocation of Article 9 renunciation is too high a price to pay for any perceived benefits."
"March 09, 2010","Think big! The international dynamic to which the global financial crisis has led in the international summit architecture offers a grand opportunity to effect a global governance reform. The paper offers suggestions for various reform scenarios, taking current global dynamics into account (in particular the G20 financial summit). The study is based on the premise that global  problems like the financial crisis or climate change can be effectively addressed only with the aid of a more inclusive and representative coordination body at the top level of global governance."
"March 09, 2010","Although the relationship between natural resources and civil war has received much attention, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Controversies and contradictions in the stylized facts persist because resource extraction is treated as exogenous while in reality fighting affects extraction. We study endogenous fighting, armament, and extraction method, speed and investment. Rapacious resource exploitation has economic costs, but can nevertheless be preferred to balanced depletion due to lowered incentives for future rebel attacks. With private exploitation, rebels fight more than the government if they can renege on the contract with the mining company, and hence government turnover is larger in this case. Incentive-compatible license fees paid by private companies and mining investment are lower in unstable countries, and increase with the quality of the government army and office rents. This implies that privatised resource exploitation is more attractive for governments who have incentives to fight hard, i.e., in the presence of large office rents and a strong army. With endogenous weapon investments, the government invests more under balanced than under rapacious or private extraction. If the government can commit before mining licenses are auctioned, it will invest more in weapons under private extraction than under balanced and rapacious nationalized extraction."
"March 09, 2010","The language of values is in fashion nowadays. Global values are often employed, either as elements of a coherent theory or simply as rhetorical tools, by some of the most influential politicians of our age. However, despite all this attention to global values, the concept itself remains somewhat obscure. The various lists of values, proposed by individual politicians, scholars, NGO’s, and international organizations, differ to some extent, both in content and in character, and a clear definition of what constitutes a global value is lacking. This article aims to explore the concept of global values. It focuses on the relationship between such values and international law. The main assumption of this article is that international law has moved from an essentially value-free order of sovereign and independent States, to a more cosmopolitan order, based on universal values and common interests. Taking that assumption as its starting point, this article basically aims to explore how and to what extent the language of global values has encroached on the traditional, consent-based foundation of the international legal order. Before turning to this central theme, i.e. the relationship between global values and international law, this article first aims to shed some light on the concept of global values itself. Then, the central theme will be dealt with. First, jus cogens and erga omnes will be discussed as legal techniques that might be used to give special legal protection to fundamental, value-based norms of general international law. After that, we will look at the role of the United Nations in ‘translating’ the language of global values into that of international law. We will end with a brief conclusion and look into the future."
"March 08, 2010","What does the idea of ´Global Community` add to multilateralism? In my view, the idea of ´Global Community` adds two things: first, it may give multilateralism a sense of direction by defining the global values that should guide this cooperation. Secondly, the idea of a ´Global Community` may make clear that those engaging in multilateralism have a shared responsibility and a collective interest, over and above self-interest, to make it work. I will also look at the reality of international relations; there may be an idea, but is there also a practice of ´Global Community`?"
"March 08, 2010","One of the most powerful methods of inducing changes in outcomes governed by international humanitarian law is to add human rights rules and arguments into the equation. This, indeed, is precisely the point of the whole project of linking these two branches of international law. This article explores the relationship between the two bodies of law, and makes several broad propositions. First, that there is a need for a change in perspective, from examining the relationship of the two regimes as such, to the interaction of particular norms that regulate specific situations. Second, that this interaction will frequently result in a norm conflict, and that we have numerous tools at our disposal for either avoiding or resolving these conflicts. Third, that lex specialis is at best a fairly limited tool of norm conflict avoidance, and that it most certainly cannot be used to describe the relationship between human rights and humanitarian law as a whole. Finally, that there are situations where all of our tools will fail us, where a norm conflict will be both unavoidable and unresolvable due to a fundamental incompatibility in the text, object and purpose, and values protected by the interacting norms, and where the only possible solution to the conflict will be a political one. The article identifies three such possible situations of unresolvable antinomy-targeted killings, preventive security detention, and positive obligations during occupation, and addresses recent cases with a norm conflict component, such as Al-Jedda, Behrami, and Al-Saadoon. Though in most cases harmony between human rights and humanitarian law is possible, and indeed desirable, we should not underestimate the practical and political relevance of situations of true norm conflict, which no amount of academic exposition will be able to fix."
"March 08, 2010","Human rights law is affected by great compliance and enforcement problems, similar to the ones affecting public international law as a whole. This is due to the states' reluctance to ""impose upon themselves binding human rights obligations, and even more so to agree to create institutions with power to oversee compliance with such obligations."""
"March 08, 2010","This chapter attempts to radicalize arguments the author has presented in previous collections. He draws on his own experience of taking Kurdish (from 1994 to 1999) and then Chechen (from 2000 to the present) cases to the European Court of Human Rights. He employs materialist and historicized account of international law and human rights for which he contends. He argues that the lex specialis doctrine as developed in recent case-law of the International Court of Justice (the ICJ) contains a category error, insofar as it brings human rights law and humanitarian law into a relationship with each other; for example, that of ‘complementarity’. Chalk is being compared with, or even substituted by, cheese. He starts with an analysis of the confusion of the ICJ. He then turns to the concept of ‘fragmentation of international law’ as it impacts on the issue of the relationship between the two bodies of law, and then outlines what are for him the key differences between IHL and IHRL. Finally, he illustrates his position in contrast to a number of contemporary scholars: Schabas, Droege, Hampson, Abresch, Quenivet and Orakhelashvili. His conclusion is that the European Court of Human Rights has in this matter at least, consciously or not, chosen the correct path in dealing with cases that have come before it, especially the Chechen cases."
"March 08, 2010","If we would like to analyze the situation with respect to nuclear liability in the European Union, we can define this as a ""patchwork"". Before the 2004 enlargement, EU Member States were basically Contracting Parties to the 1960 Paris Convention and most of them to the 1963 Brussels Supplementary Convention as well. Mainly, the Contracting Parties to the 1963 Vienna Convention entered the Union during the 2004 and 2008 enlargements. While all of these Vienna Convention states were also Parties to the 1988 Joint Protocol, only eight of the Paris Convention states joined this instrument, creating a ""bridge"" between the Paris and the Vienna Conventions. Until now, European Law hasn’t covered nuclear liability which, as a consequence remains in the sphere of national legislation and international treaties. Discussions concerning the nuclear liability ""patchwork situation"" were already opened under the aegis of the European Commission in 2005, but it was then paralyzed because of strict resistance by the new Central- and Eastern European Member States. On the occasion of the AIDN/INLA biannual meeting, held in Brussels in September 2007, EC Commissioner for Energy, Andris Piebalgs, pointed out the current situation in the area of nuclear liability frameworks within Communities, which were described as very unsatisfactory from the EC Commission point of view and he announced further activity of the European Communities towards harmonizing nuclear liability regime. Some months later, in December 2007, the European Commission employed a Spanish Law Firm to develop and distribute a questionnaire exploring the views of EU states and EU industry regarding the current nuclear liability situation with the view toward reconciling that field of law within the EU and evaluating results obtained by the questionnaire."
"March 08, 2010","In recent years, maritime conflicts between China and the United States have occurred successively in the sea areas around China. Legally, these conflicts were caused by the different interpretation and application between the two countries of the LOS Convention or the customary international law rules reflected in the Convention, including mainly, firstly, jurisdiction over military activities, such as military surveys in the EEZ; and secondly, marine scientific research and classification of activities of marine data collection. China's practices conform with the Convention and the contemporary international practice. However, as a non-State-party to the Convention, the United States has taken advantage of the parts of the Convention that are in its own interests and is trying to escape from the relevant international legal obligations."
"March 08, 2010","In this article I explore how international humanitarian law (IHL) is used in advocacy on ‘undercover’ operations-the wearing of civilian clothes by Israel's security forces in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). Assessing applicable legal standards-the duty of combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population, and the rule prohibiting perfidy-I show that legal claims, reporting practices and strategies comprising the advocacy on ‘undercover’ operations in the OPT make inadequate and inefficient use of IHL. Advocacy on ‘undercover’ operations does not reference and utilize appropriate legal standards; nor does it ground allegations and strategies in the normative and factual inquiries these standards entail. Such advocacy is insensitive to highly relevant factual, legal and policy specificities of the OPT. Decontextualized, advocacy on ‘undercover’ operations presents neither a coherent legal argument nor cogent compliance-inducing strategies. It generates inefficient, unpersuasive discourse that more likely undermines than supports the prospects of changing the practices it challenges."
"March 08, 2010","China's views on coastal State authority in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are not supported by State practice, the negotiating history of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), or a plain reading of Part V of the Convention. All nations may legitimately engage in military activities in foreign EEZs without prior notice to, or consent of, the coastal State concerned. Efforts were made during the negotiations of UNCLOS to broaden coastal State rights and jurisdiction in the EEZ to include security interests. However, the Conference rejected these efforts and the final text of the Convention (Article 58) ultimately preserved high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the seas related to those freedoms, to include military activities, in the EEZ."
"March 08, 2010","This article examines the principle of state immunity from the civil jurisdiction of national courts as it has been applied to officials. In Jones v Saudi Arabia the House of Lords held that individual officials should have the benefit of immunity, notwithstanding the possibility of criminal prosecution as agreed by states parties to the United Nations Convention Against Torture. It is incontrovertible as a matter of international and English law that the state itself is immune from suit in torture claims but there was scant authority prior to Jones requiring the extension of immunity to individual officials. There are two key hurdles for the torture victim to surmount: first, it must be demonstrated that the forum state has jurisdiction to make and adjudicate rules regarding the relevant conduct and, secondly, that any claim to immunity should be denied. It is argued that the assertion of civil jurisdiction over torture which has taken place in another country is permissible under English rules on conflict of laws and would not be excessive in view of the recognition of criminal jurisdiction by states parties to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and under customary international law. It is further argued that to allow civil suit against the torturer (but not the state) would not offend the principles of public international law that relate to immunity, nor should it breach the State Immunity Act 1978."
"March 08, 2010","This Editorial Comment introduces the Agora: Military Activities in the EEZ featured in the March 2010 issue of the Chinese Journal of International Law and sketches the debate on the topic. It also highlights some arguments on pivotal issues, including (1) whether the existing framework of Part V of the LOS Convention, as a result of the existence of Article 59 on residual rights, favours the finding of a security interest of the coastal States to which others acting in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) must pay due regard; and (2) whether the need to ensure the safety of the freedom of navigation favours the existence of the right to conduct “pure” oceanographic sea lane mapping by other States in the EEZ of a coastal State that is not prejudicial to the security interest of the coastal State."
"March 08, 2010","The interrelationship of international human rights and humanitarian law is, in spite of the existence of a considerable level of literature on point, still somewhat uncertain. There have been claims that the two areas have increasingly converged, which have been countered with arguments to the effect that the twain never shall meet. This piece sees to investigate the relationship between these areas though an empirical analysis of the practice of the ICTY, and the way in which that Tribunal has sought to use human rights jurisprudence in a humanitarian law, and international criminal law, context. To show this, the piece analyses the relevant jurisprudence of the ICTY. Whilst giving credit where it is due, this piece attempts to show that the ICTY's practice, whilst not unimpeachable, has, in its more recent pronouncements, taken a more sophisticated approach than other international courts. With this in mind, he piece argues that in spite of its flaws, the later jurisprudence of the ICTY has helped to show that the interrelationships of international law, criminal law, human rights law, and international criminal law are not simple. As such the ICTY as made a useful contribution to the area, and one which has been somewhat more carefully thought through than the comments of other international courts, who have used the ICTY's jurisprudence without passing comment on the differentials that may exist between international criminal law and international law, and human rights law, in particular."
"March 08, 2010","In the Marine I case, the Committee Against Torture provides direction as regards the question of determining responsibility for safeguarding the human rights of migrants intercepted or rescued at sea and processed in the territory of another country. This analysis of the Committee's views in this case explores various issues of maritime search and rescue responsibilities and the subsequent responsibilities for safeguarding human rights, including protection from refoulement."
"March 08, 2010","There are two aspects to the controversy over the Okinawa Trough between the States bordering the East China Sea. The scientific aspect concerns whether the Okinawa Trough disrupts the unity of the continental shelf in the East China Sea, and the legal aspect concerns whether geophysical factors should be considered in the delimitation between opposite States where the distance between their coasts is less than 400 nautical miles. The role of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in the determination of the scientific nature of the Okinawa Trough is limited by the non-prejudice clause in Article 76 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. If the Okinawa Trough is proved to constitute a fundamental discontinuity between the natural prolongation of China and Korea on the one hand, and that of Japan on other hand, the median line between the opposite coasts concerned should not be applied in the continental shelf delimitation, for it cannot achieve an equitable solution."
"March 08, 2010","Values are “possibilities whose realization may make lives good.” This definition is attractive because it is short and still contains the essential: values are seen as ideas whose realization is both possible and desirable. Three questions need to be answered before this definition can be meaningfully applied to the international community: whose lives are we talking about? Who will come up with the possibilities? And who is responsible for realizing them? After having addressed these questions, I will turn to the United Nations and explain its unique role in defining and realizing/promoting our global values. In the third part, I will look at the proceedings of the San Francisco Conference of 1945, where the United Nations Charter was drafted and the Organization established, and focus thereby on the role of one of the most fundamental global values and the clearest expression of the cosmopolitan idea: human rights."
"March 08, 2010","Claims that Tibet was independent during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) or had “de facto independence” from the Republic of China (1911-1949) are belied by fact and law. Tibet's elites regarded themselves as subjects of the Emperor, who saw himself and was seen by foreigners as the ruler of China, including Tibet. Supposed indicia of Tibet independence from 1913-1951 (a flag, stamps, currency, passports, visas, etc.) do not attest to statehood: many parts of China then and provinces or autonomous areas of countries today have had these features. No matter which international law theory of the recognition of States is used, Tibet was not one, but was a pseudo-State, like present-day Abkhazia or Somaliland. Tibet today thus has acquired no “right to independence”; yet, sections of Indian and US political elites continue to regard the claim of Tibet's statehood as a useful lever in conflicts with China."
"March 08, 2010","The language of values is in fashion nowadays. Global values are often employed, either as elements of a coherent theory or simply as rhetorical tools, by some of the most influential politicians of our age. Global values have also become a popular object of study for many scholars, particularly in the disciplines of international law, political science, and philosophy. The question many international lawyers ask themselves these days is, somewhat bluntly formulated, whether international law has moved from an essentially value-free order of sovereign and independent states, to a more cosmopolitan order, based on universal values and common interests. Political scientists ask themselves a similar question; one can simply replace the words ‘international law’ with ‘the world’. Many cosmopolitan philosophers, more concerned with ideas than with the actual state of affairs, have since ancient times been preaching for a world led by common interests and values. Boosted by globalization, one can see that in recent years this strand of cosmopolitanism is experiencing a revival: it now seems a possible description of reality."
"March 07, 2010","This article looks at the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the responsibility of states for violations of Convention rights committed through acts of international organisations. The author begins with Matthews v. United Kingdom and considers the recent judgment of D. v. Turkey and the Grand Chamber admissibility decisions in Behrami and Behrami v. France and Saramati v. France, Germany and Norway in detail with reference to past decisions and decisions of the UK House of Lords."
"March 07, 2010","Today, many individuals are victims, not of foreign military aggression and nuclear war, but of violence committed against them by their own state. Moreover, the security of individuals is threatened, not by military forces, but by criminals and terrorists, the forces of nature, disease, and poverty. The traditional interstate security paradigm has no place for most of these threats, and considers many of them to be essentially domestic affairs. The aim of my paper is to briefly look at the choice between a state-centered and an individual-centered approach to global security. I will look at the debates on ‘human security’ and ‘state security’, focusing on the most influential reports and declarations on this issue of the last two decades."
"March 07, 2010","Some authors compare the constitutional structure of the United Nations with that of a state. There is a court (International Court of Justice), a parliamentary assembly (General Assembly), and an executive organ (Security Council). In most states, these organs check each other’s power, thereby creating a delicate balance. In my paper, I will find out whether a similar system of checks and balances exists for the United Nations, and focus thereby on judicial checks on the Security Council. After concluding that the International Court does not possess powers of judicial review or appeal in respect of decisions taken by the Security Council, I will look elsewhere. Perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, this is where the European Union comes in. In Kadi, the European Court of Justice decided that it was empowered to check the lawfulness of the resolutions of the Security Council, but only with regard to jus cogens."
"March 06, 2010","In this article, we examine the acceptance of dying among Turkish and Dutch military cadets and mid-career officers. This is an important issue because the so-called casualty factor seems to play an increasing role in decision-making on whether or not to initiate and continue military actions. It may be argued that the acceptance of casualties in the military varies across national armed forces. The Netherlands are considered to be a highly individualist society whose armed forces are not very well known for their martial tradition and history. The Turkish society, on the other hand, is more collectivistic and its armed forces are proud of their martial history, tradition and reputation. Survey data collected among cadets and mid-career officers in military academies and staff colleges of the two countries confirm these ‘‘images’’ to a large degree. The two samples display significant and substantial differences in accepting the risk of dying in the expected direction. In addition, we examine the impact of these differences on the willingness and ability to collaborate internationally. The results of these analyses confirm the so-called Terror Management Theory to a large degree. The implications of these results are discussed in the final part of this study."
"March 06, 2010","This paper discusses two cases of segregation between men and women in Israel. In both cases, the segregation was based on religious justifications and in both cases the Israeli High Court of Justice (HCJ) either enforced the segregation (the ‘Women of the Wall’ case) or expressed a principled willingness to do so in the future, subject to certain formal conditions (the ‘segregation in buses’ case)."
"March 06, 2010","Liberia's civil conflict spanned over two decades, causing incalculable damage in its wake. In 2005 the Government of Liberia established a truth and reconciliation commission (TRC) to address crimes committed during the war, to act as the sole adjudicator of war crimes in Liberia. It is the first TRC in the world with a mandate to prosecute economic crimes. Hence, the success of the TRC greatly affects prospects for peace in Liberia, and approaches to transitional justice the world over. However, several factors seriously threaten the efficacy of the TRC, including a weak legal framework for addressing economic crimes, internal power struggles at the TRC, lack of resources, and exclusion of public participation in the TRC process. The author argues that economic crimes are a principal cause of Liberia's civil conflict, and that post-conflict efforts aimed at addressing these crimes are insufficient. She also discusses the administrative impediments that prevent the TRC from effectively deterring the commission of economic crimes. The author concludes by offering recommendations to the TRC that will strengthen its capacity to execute its mandate."

Thus, an interaction between Indian economy and world’s economy is inevitable .Arbitration is supposed to be a simple, user-friendly process. In fact, if arbitration is well designed and competently handled. Arbitration is often categorized as a kind of Alternative Dispute Resolution process. Arbitration resolves disputes when the parties cannot agree. Like litigation, it is a tiebreaker, to be used if and only if, the parties cannot settle their differences by agreement. Arbitration is increasingly the dispute resolution mechanism of choice in international transactions."

"March 06, 2010","Most recently, the old discussion on identifying gaps in existing nuclear liability regimes as well as finding ways how to reach a uniform standard of claims arising from a nuclear incident can be considered as more actual than in the years before. The so called “Nuclear Renaissance” or “Nuclear New Build”  can’t be limited to nuclear sites multiplications, but must occur parallel with creating and strengthening legal framework for nuclear and radiation safety, security and safe – guarding.  As OECD⁄NEA stressed in its Nuclear Energy Outlook 2008, “the international community must be prepared to adapt the existing international legal framework to those new realities.”  Due to the fact, nuclear liability law is considered to be one of the core legal issues affiliated to the peaceful use of the nuclear energy, legal discussions on uniform standard of nuclear liability rules will be for sure essential part of the further development."
"March 06, 2010","This article argues that the mass deportations and executions committed by the Ottoman regime against the Armenian people constituted a crime of humanity but did not rise to the level of a systematic and sustained effort to exterminate an entire people. It presents an objective dispassionate examination of the known historical facts to correctly characterize the wrongs committed against the Armenian people in hopes of helping to attain the outcome of reconciliation of Turkish and Armenian peoples. As such it represents an example of the theory of therapeutic jurisprudence in practice. Circa 18 pages."

The EU must also complete the lacking elements of the Single European market architecture (such as European financial supervision) and help in strengthening global policy and regulatory coordination."

"March 03, 2010","During recent decades improved supply chain management, innovation in information technology, new financial instruments, etc. have changed the economic environment for production in the EU significantly. This led to and was accompanied by increased coordination of economic policy and the use of a new mode of governance, the Open Method of Co-ordination. Simultaneously, at the national level tendencies of fragmentation in industrial relations appeared. Is this mere congruence, or is it possible to establish causal relationships? For the case of Germany the impact of coordinated European policies on industrial relations at national level is assessed. Potential consequences for supranational economic governability are discussed."
"March 03, 2010","Informal justice refers to the social phenomenon consisting of settling disputes between litigants outside state courts, the formal justice system. “Tribal judges” are the main actors of tribal justice. In recent years, though, conciliation committees were established,  sometimes spontaneously, but most of the time, through the direct intervention of the PA, most specifically the executive authority,  or even by political factions. “Tribal conciliation” is used to describe both the process and the outcome of the conflict resolution carried out by tribal judges or by conciliation committees."
"March 03, 2010","This article focuses on the ius ad bellum provisions contained in the Protocol on Non-aggression and Mutual Defence which forms an integral part of the 2006 African Great Lakes Pact. The Protocol contains peculiar provisions that provide the opportunity to develop broader considerations on the alleged African unorthodox approach to the regulation of the use of armed force. The Protocol is not considered in isolation and is analysed taking into account other analogous African treaties, with the ultimate purpose of establishing whether or not its provisions are consistent with existing law. Section 2 deals with the prohibition of aggression and compares the definition contained in the Great Lakes Protocol with that adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1974. Section 3 analyses the right of individual and collective self-defence as contained in the Protocol and discusses its consistency with Article 51 of the UN Charter and customary international law. Finally, the last two sections investigate whether and under what conditions the Protocol provides for further exceptions to the prohibition of the use of force in addition to self-defence, in particular the ‘responsibility to protect’ populations by military means and the right of pro-democratic intervention."
"March 03, 2010","The Czech Republic and Slovakia, both contracting parties to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage of 1963, joined the European Union (EU) on 1 May 2004. Both countries have announced plans to increase their nuclear capacities during the process of the so-called nuclear new build. Owing to these developments, nuclear legislation within these Central European states is of rising interest to specialists abroad. This paper aims to deal with the existing obligations in both countries arising from international conventions and current national legislation on matters of nuclear liability. Special attention is paid to the methods by which provisions of the Vienna Convention have been implemented into their national acts, particularly regarding minimal limits of operator liability. Differences between the current legal regimes are pointed out. Furthermore, the paper deals with actual developments in the area of nuclear liability, particularly developments in Slovakia, which declared that future nuclear liability legislation must be oriented towards the possibility that the country will accede to the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy of 1960, as amended by the Protocol of 2004."
"March 03, 2010","Most modern states have adopted written and rigid constitutions. The existence of a constitution presupposes a constituent power, distinguished from other constituted powers, created by the constitution itself. A constituent power presupposes the ability of a society to develop its capacity to act as a collective, in order to gain (or regain) an active role in the organization of the lives of individuals and their social relationships with one another."
"March 02, 2010","As the European Union (EU) has strengthened, scholars have emphasized the development of multilevel governance structures and the salience of subnational actors. With the launch of the Open Method of Coordination and the increasing development of non-binding regulations, we must re-consider the potential of this type of governance instrument to serve as an intergovernmental and intra-governmental coordinative mechanism; thus contributing to the development of multilevel governance structures. This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the implementation of the European Employment Strategy and its potential to serve as an intra-governmental coordinative instrument. I argue that this non-binding instrument does informally (de facto) influence intra-governmental relations in member states. In addition, subnational actors have transferred many of these soft principles to lower levels of government. These propositions are explored using data gathered in the EU, Spain, Belgium, and Sweden at both the national and the sub national levels."
"March 02, 2010","Hayek argues that when governments violate people's rights by imposing discriminatory laws it may be necessary to do something to correct the situation. He suggests limiting corrective actions in two ways: only address harms that occurred in the relatively recent past, and impose no new discrimination. As a result of a very long history of discriminatory legislation, black South Africans suffered substantial harms at the hands of past governments. Following the political transition in 1994, the new government implemented land reform policies designed, in part, to satisfy calls for social justice. This paper examines these policies in the context of Hayek's arguments."
"March 02, 2010","This paper examines the idea that commercial law has the capacity to evolve spontaneously in the absence of a clear state authority because of its unique nature. I argue that the manner of interaction implied by commerce plays a crucial role in this ability as it involves a high degree of overall engagement. This I term “high engagement,” which I divide into two elements: repetition and the creation of clear cycles of interaction. Together they produce identifiable legal norms and subsequent compliance. Game theorists have long recognized the importance of repeated interaction in inducing cooperation; however, how the manner of commercial interaction itself facilitates this process has been left largely unexamined.  Part I presents a brief overview of the concept of reciprocity and spontaneous law theory. In Part II, a more detailed explanation of the notion of high engagement is offered. Here I set out exactly how high engagement is instrumental in the emergence of legal norms. Finally, the paper concludes that the element of high engagement indeed plays a decisive role in commercial law’s ability to evolve and function in a decentralized, spontaneous fashion — an important insight in terms of the future international development of the modern law merchant as it emerges in the absence of a single legislative authority."
"March 02, 2010","The internationalization of infrastructure raises the issue of internationalization of regulatory governance. By internationalization of infrastructure, I mean the presence if not predominance of cross-border interconnections, ownership, interdependencies, spillovers, and the like. Such cross-border relationships are not new, but are growing in their significance. In several instances, this internationalization of infrastructure has led to internationalization of regulatory activity, such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), international cooperation among competition authorities, and supranational regulators – for example, the European Union (EU) or the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL). The formal authority of these arrangements ranges from completely voluntary organizations, such as associations of regulators or cooperative committees, to institutions with coercive power. There is interest in expanding international regulation with greater coercive power. I examine the issue of the scope of regulatory institutions in the presence of international infrastructure. I do not find a pressing need to internationalize additional regulatory institutions for infrastructure, but I do see a need to leverage the co-evolution of service providers, customers, and governance institutions to learn through experimentation."

"March 01, 2010","The article analyzes the role of evidentiary standards under international law and how perceptions of evidence on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) allegations led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  The evidentiary record is built by using the five-year Senate Select Committee on Intelligence investigation of the pre-invasion intelligence information (concluded in June 2008), the Iraqi Survey Group physical inspection findings during occupation, other government studies, and verified media releases over the past six years.  Findings are juxtaposed with the domestic level issue formation, the UN Security Council interactions, and the four months of UN inspection reports.  The chronological case study builds a structure of evidentiary standards, explains why Security Council interactions were logistically effective but ultimately unavailing, and is applied to a two-level domestic/international interactive game framework that distinguishes between established evidence and media assertions.  Diplomatic and inspector evidentiary perceptions are analyzed as they progressed and are applied to resolution language that should have been the legal frame of reference for breach.  Evidentiary standards of proof for breach were required in Security Council resolutions, all UN processes, UN inspection obligations, under good faith diplomacy principles, and even the language of Congress’s October 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq.  However, preconditions were bypassed.  Since the UN Security Council does not possess a formal and dispassionate evidentiary fact-finding institution and diplomatically-produced information can commingle with potentially irreconcilable prerogatives of sovereign authority, an augmenting pressure dynamic can arise to supplant objectivity and relegate impartial, sober, and dispassionate legal processes to the realm of politics."
"March 01, 2010","Understanding those factors critical to predicting public response is crucial to our ability to model the consequences of a terrorist strike in an urban area. Sixteen hypothetical damage scenarios were systematically varied according to non-terrorism vs. terrorism, explosions vs. infectious disease releases, terrorists' motives as demands to release prisoners vs. solely to instill fear, non-terrorists' motives as non-intentional vs. intentional (criminal), victims as government officials vs. tourists, non-terrorist incidents as involving no negligence vs. negligence, terrorist acts as non-suicidal vs. suicidal, and number of casualties (0, 15, 495). The setting was a local theme park. Students at a university in San Diego County were randomly assigned to different scenario conditions. For these scenarios, they were asked to address a number of questions regarding their perceptions and likely behaviors during and following an accident or terrorist strike. Results from regression modeling and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) indicated that terrorism and the mechanism used were most influential followed by the presence of suicide or negligence, motive, and victim. Number of casualties made little difference once these other factors were accounted for. To forecast community response, a system dynamics model was introduced that incorporated the study's survey findings. This model simulated the immediate and mid-term diffusion of fear in a community for different types of accidental and terrorist events. These findings should prove useful to those wishing to predict public response to a variety of different contingencies involving terrorism."
"March 01, 2010","Two hypotheses about the determinants of Russian intergovernmental grants are tested. According to the first hypothesis, federal transfers to regions correlate with recent voting behaviour of regional electorates. The second hypothesis states that transfers are higher in regions with politically powerful governors. I find a strong confirmation for the first hypothesis and no evidence for the second hypothesis for the years 1995-99. This result is robust across specifications. However, in the years 2000-2004 electoral variables show no effect on transfers. The only significant political variable is Putin’s visits to regions."
"February 28, 2010","Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolutions 1368 and 1373, serving as the foundation of a global counter-terrorism system. At the heart of this system lies a close partnership between the Security Council and the UN member states – a partnership in which states were given considerable operational responsibility.  Most scholarly evaluations of this system have focused on its UN aspects, with little reference to the key role assigned to the states.  Thus, their assessments have been more pessimistic about the system’s ability to counter terrorism. In this article, we present a new conceptualization of this system and show with two case studies that the system has attained some important objectives in the global struggle against terrorism."
"February 28, 2010","Existing studies of cost growth in defense acquisition have been predominantly descriptive rather than explanatory. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of decision-making by government officials as a factor affecting cost growth. While observers of defense acquisition acknowledge the role of social, cultural and institutional factors on program performance, few studies are focused there. Thus, informed by the literatures on cost growth, behavioral finance, group decision-making, and organizational failure, a research agenda is developed to consider factors affecting cost growth beyond those traditionally studied. Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development framework can be the foundation of a stream of research including both field studies and laboratory/computational experiments that may provide fresh insights into the cost growth phenomenon and — more importantly — aid in the design of more effective policy interventions."
"February 28, 2010","This extended policy/political essay argues that targeted killing, by means of unmanned aerial vehicles such as Predator ""drones"" and including targeted killing as carried out by the CIA, is both a good policy in combating transnational terrorism and a lawful means of self-defense under international law.  Lengthy (for a political magazine, at 8,000 words, but easier to read in this pdf format) and unabashedly polemical, the essay urges the Obama administration's lawyers to step up publicly and articulate their views of the legality of targeted killing, and further argues that they need to do so as a matter, not of a narrow concept of targeting combatants in and armed conflict, but as a more general and flexible exercise in the international law of self-defense.  The Obama administration's expansion of the targeted killing program is defended, but the failure of the administration's lawyers to offer a public defense of it and articulate its legal grounds, even as the President, Vice-President, and other senior officials both expand the program and take credit for it, is questioned and criticized.  The essay suggests that a general campaign within the international ""soft law"" community is gradually gathering momentum to undermine the legal legitimacy of targeted killing, particularly by covert services of the civilian CIA, and that the administration needs to defend traditional American legal views governing these policies."

"February 28, 2010","Under what circumstances can the provision of social services, including that provided as humanitarian assistance, contribute to the management and transformation of civil wars? This dissertation addresses this question through a qualitative comparative analysis of social service provision during three civil wars - Northern Ireland (1969-1998), southern Sudan (1983-2005) and Tajikistan (1992-1997). Drawing from theoretical advances in the field of contentious politics, it identifies two forms of brokerage, namely opportunity hoarding and exploitation as key causal mechanisms related to social service provision during civil wars. Drawing on field research in each of the three cases considered, this dissertation argues that in situations where social services are provided in a relatively autonomous way from categorical groups engaged in conflict, social services can materially impact the incentive structure of insurgencies, resulting in organizational changes that in turn can increase prospects for peace. These changes arise because of brokerage opportunities between local populations and social service systems created by autonomous social service systems. Furthermore, in situations where social services are of a relatively high capacity, social service systems can, over time, also address social grievances, taking these issues off the table when peace talks actually take place."
"February 28, 2010","Because of its uniquely commanding height, outer space has gained even greater military and strategic value in the post-Cold War international strategic environment. This provides for the possibility - some say probability - that outer space will become a platform for warfare.  This development can only have negative consequences in the long term. As the United States pursues a policy that incorporates the placing of weapons in outer space, the other major space faring powers have not been idly sitting by. Recent advances in space technologies have put the development of space weapons within the realm of possibility for several other countries. This article seeks to revisit the intersection of the principal international treaties governing the use and exploration of outer space - primarily the Outer Space Treaty - and the United Nations Charter, in the light of contemporary developments. It outlines recent events in the emerging spaces arms race, which highlight even more the need both to emphasize the centrality of the ‘peaceful purposes’ mantra that underpins the exploration and use of space and to understand its operational rubrics and legal dynamics. It concludes by noting that the future of space security will depend on how effectively all States strive for the ‘de-weaponization’ of outer space by adhering to the peaceful purposes principle."
"February 28, 2010","Growing transnational integration leads to an incremental exercise of governmental functions abroad and to increasing transferrals of governmental authority to international organisations. The question arises where, for whom, and under which conditions the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) is applicable. This issue involves first the question of the scope of the Convention, second the problem of the attribution of potentially illegal acts to a member state of the convention, and third the question of the Strasbourg Human Rights Court’s jurisdiction. The starting point of reflections on scope, attribution and jurisdiction is the insight that the ECHR is a regional human rights instrument, and that some kind of coordination of multiple regimes is required in a polycentric and polyarchic world. Therefore the application of the ECHR outside the espace juridique of the Convention and in situations, in which international organisations are involved, should remain the exception. International legal coordination presupposes respect for foreign state sovereignty, but also respect for the autonomy of other autonomous political actors, such as the United Nations. On the other hand, a categorical non-application of the Convention in constellations of complex jurisdiction would run counter to the idea of effective human rights protection."
"February 28, 2010","One of the reasons that terrorism is unconventional and viewed as beyond the pale is because it adopts an arbitrary stance.  War is the predictable and directed waging of armed conflict against an enemy, where as terrorism can not be anticipated or calculated because it’s ominous and malevolent actions do not discriminate between the enemy and civilians. In deed the greater the number of civilian casualties the greater the prominence they bring to their political cause. The distinction here is that we can seek to place limits on war because both sides agree to the terms under which they fight and both stand to gain from the benefits of limitation. But acts of terror rely upon the absence of limitation (including the absence distinction, proportionality, military necessity) for psychological impact such that there is no mutual benefit of placing constraints or confines on actions taken. Thus terrorism has passed over the parameters of warfare and into the realm of criminal conduct or alternatively it is employing the methods of warfare with a criminal intent. It seems therefore that terrorists should either be thought of as criminal behavior, in which case they might be accused of violating criminal law, or they should be thought of as acting within the scope of war and peace, in which case they might be accused of violating either the law of war or the law of peace.  However, they do not seem to fall clearly in either scenario thus despite being law violators, they have situated themselves in an impossible place, located somewhere outside of the law."
"February 27, 2010","From the perspective of science, art and intellectual life in general, Interwar Vienna was one of the most vibrant communities in modern European history. Within the field of economics, it was home to, amongst others, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek, Hans Mayer, Gottfried Haberler, Fritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern, Karl Menger and Abraham Wald. The community flourished after the end of World War I, and then began to suffer in the early 1930’s as a result of growing political instability and rising anti-semitism. With the Anschluss of Austria by the Third Reich in March 1938, it collapsed completely, never to recover. Drawing on the personal papers of two key participants, Oskar Morgenstern and Karl Menger, and also on the archives of the Rockefeller Foundation, this paper provides a portrait of that community, chronicling its evolution and dramatic collapse. Particular attention is paid to the milieu surrounding Morgenstern, both as director of the Rockefeller-funded Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research and as philosophical “dissident”. In collaborating with mathematicians Menger, Wald and, later, John von Neumann, he gradually forsook his Austrian theoretical legacy. The account detailed here shows conflict and tension to have been central to both the life and death of this fabled community."
"February 27, 2010","This book chapter surveys existing conflicts among national ethical rules in international arbitration, analyzes recent developments in legal ethics and proposes innovations for the international arbitration community to manage and resolve these conflicts in a manner that will both alleviate the practical problems that arise in the absence of shared ethical principles, and strengthen the system as it works to develop and enforce internally its own international legal ethics.  It is one chapter in a larger volume, The Art of Advocacy in International Arbitration, edited by Doak Bishop and Edward Kehoe, which provides analysis about the inner workings of the international arbitration system and guidance for counsel operating in that system."
"February 26, 2010","There is a counterintuitive gap in the club theory of religion. While it elegantly accounts for the notable success of strict sectarian religious groups in recruiting members and maintaining commitment, it exhibits less satisfactory properties when used to account for groups requiring neither extreme nor zero sacrifice. Such corner solutions, compared to the moderate middle, are rarely observed empirically. Within the original representative agent model, moderate groups are everywhere and always a suboptimal choice for rational, utility maximizing agents. In this paper, we extend the original model to operate within a multi-agent computational context, with heterogeneous agents occupying coordinates in a two dimensional lattice, making repeated decisions over time. Our model offers the possibility of successful moderate groups, including outcomes wherein the population is dominated by moderate groups. The viability of moderate groups is a result of heterogeneous agent wages. Lower wage agents offer greater time contributions, but lesser financial contributions to groups. Higher sacrifice rates incentive greater contributions from members, but reduce private productivity and screen out other potential members with greater financial resources. Moderate groups succeed by offering an optimal balance of these countervailing forces."
"February 26, 2010","Very aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed over the next ten years to avoid a “planet on fire.” Current sub-national, national and international policy assumes that carbon sequestration, biofuels, nuclear power, ocean fertilization, atmospheric aerosols, and other such technologies, which heretofore have been considered too novel or too dangerous to use, will have to be deployed at large scale, globally. Moving forward with promising technologies that might preserve us from the consequences of global warming will be difficult because they also pose potential hazards, promise uncertain benefits, and in some cases are already burdened with restrictive legislation and poor public image. The lack of a rational process of risk assessment and public decision making is likely to lead to a poor longterm outcome. Moreover, the standard administrative and political processes used to assess such risks can take years, time that we do not have. Principled and practical policymaking demand citizens participate in the decision to develop and use these novel technologies. Environmental assessment, horizon scanning, and new research on human and organizational factors suggest techniques to improve technology development decisions."

"February 26, 2010","International humanitarian law (IHL) does not prohibit military action resulting in the loss of civilian life at large. As long as its rules on the protection of civilians and their property are followed, the incidental causation of civilian loss is legal. Why is this so? The not-so-naïve answer is that contemporary military operations would be made difficult, if they were to be carried out under legal norms leaving no room for civilian casualties whatsoever. Such severe constraints were as undesirable for states developing ius in bello through history as the total absence of constraints. That apart, incidental and lawful civilian losses within the framework of IHL could be seen as indispensable signs in a symbolic order fettering violent conflicts in communities. With this text, I would like to outline how this possibility might be researched in a future, more comprehensive project. In choosing targeting as an area, I believe that I am close to an archetypical norm on the fettering of violence in the laws of war. The present text features two distinct steps."

It was not identical in the West and the East, however, and this article explores these differences."
"February 24, 2010","The aim of this paper is the study of the enhanced cooperation mechanism in the framework of the Lisbon Treaty as it applies to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the EU. The concept of enhanced cooperation was introduced into the EU Treaty structure by the Treaty of Amsterdam, although initially the CFSP was excluded. The Treaty of Nice extended a limited possibility of enhanced cooperation to the CFSP, while still excluding from its scope all ‘matters having military or defence implications’. The Treaty of Lisbon, at the same time as emphasising solidarity and the building of a common policy, accepts the extension of enhanced cooperation and flexibility into the defence sphere. The object of this paper, as well as outlining the ways in which enhanced cooperation has applied to the CFSP and the ways in which this will be affected by the Treaty of Lisbon, is to examine the extent to which foreign policy, security and defence lend themselves to enhanced cooperation and other forms of flexibility. The conclusion is that there is a need to distinguish between foreign policy and defence; the development of an active and credible EU foreign policy cannot readily accommodate differentiated integration as it depends for its force not primarily on either legally binding instruments or coercion but on political weight. On the other hand, military and defence capacities and initiatives are perhaps inherently differentiated."
"February 24, 2010","Using findings from the World Values Survey, I argue for a consideration of generational difference as an overlooked component of social value systems, change, and cultural conflict in the international system.  To the extent that such value systems underlie oft-unspoken shared understandings, and even formalized agreements replete with value-based assumptions, understanding this unstated dynamic is important in reconciling what otherwise appear to be insurmountable ‘civilizational divides’. To this end, I discuss generation, alongside civilization, as productive levels of analysis (or analytic variables) in international relations."

"February 24, 2010","This study explores the Palestinian curriculum from an Israeli perspective. Israelis accused the Palestinian school books do not teach the notions of peace and coexistence with Israel, but plant the seeds of hate in upcoming Palestinian generations through their delegitimization of Israel’s existence, hotbed of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic, implicit seeking of Israel’s destruction, defamation of Israel and encouraging militarism and violence. Findings show that the consensus of expert opinion on Palestinian Authority schoolbooks is quite different from what Israelis accused. The overall orientation of the Palestinian curriculum is peaceful in spite of the harsh and violent realities in which schools operate; they are focusing on teaching human rights concepts, justice, peace, equality, freedom, and tolerance, in terms of both self and others, and it encourages tolerance among religions and ask students to respect the freedom of religion and protect religious places as well. They tell history from a Palestinian point of view and reflect Palestinian life and reality as victims, as well as the diversity within Palestinian society, taking into consideration his culture, norms, heritage, values, and believes. Accordingly, Palestinian curriculum should teach Palestinian history from a Palestinian, rather than a Zionist, perspective. Finally, Palestinian school books are not perfect since they are under continual revision and improvement."
"February 24, 2010","In 2008, Gerard Bouchard and Charles Taylor released an important report as Co-Chairs of the Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences. The Commission was set up by the Quebec government in response to public discontent concerning ""reasonable accommodation"" of religious and cultural practices. In the report, four delicate issues, among others, are examined: cultural integration, collective identity, church-state relations and the most appropriate procedures for handling cultural and religious harmonization requests. Altogether, the Co-Chairs’ positions propound a normative conception of sociocultural integration in a pluralist society. This conception, that may be called ""interculturalism"", is conceived by the commissioners as an alternative to ""multiculturalism"". The text examines whether interculturalism, as conceived in the report, is anything but a version of multiculturalism. The contention is that it is a rose by any other name."
"February 23, 2010","Drawing political parallels between the Czech Republic and other members of the Visegrad group of countries, the author explains the continuing popularity of neo-liberal politics in the Czech Republic and some of the policies deployed to achieve it: unemployment control and wage regulation, bankruptcy prevention, social safety nets, and active labor market policies. Many of these policies, although inconsistent with the Thatcherite rhetoric of the government, form the backbone of its popular support. The privatization program, its adept implementation by the government, and its contribution to government popularity are also described. The sociological consequences of these political actions are discussed with reference to the Czech transformation; the author defines important public attitudes and describes how the population was prepared to make compromises, thus indicating the degree of confidence in the government. In conclusion, political culture and economic strength are recognized as integral parts of this complicated reform, whose success the author attributes to its social acceptability with regard to the voters, and to the skill of the government in its implementation."
"February 23, 2010","This paper analyzes how the values premised in Zimbabwe’s colonial history and liberation struggle, ideological differences and partocracy have influenced the perspectives of the Zimbabwe and the Western governments respectively in understanding the causes that led to the imposition of sanctions on Zimbabwe. Furthermore, this article explores the nature of Zimbabwe sanctions by making a comparative analysis of the perceptions of both the sanctioners and the sanctionees. Fundamental to this analysis is the diversity in jargon used in addressing the nature of sanctions. This paper concludes by proffering recommendations on how the parties involved can resolve this “war on lingo” to resolve Zimbabwe’s catastrophe."
"February 22, 2010","This article examines the revival and transformation of minority protection in Europe in the post-1989 era. Based on an exploration of the 1995 Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and related activities of the Advisory Committee to this Convention, it attempts in particular to discern how the new discourse on diversity that developed around the ideas of multiculturalism and pluralism contributes to re-shape the legal understanding of minority rights after 1989, compared to the traditional conception of minority protection in international law. Two main issues are considered. First, discussions surrounding the legal definition of a minority, with particular attention to the issue whether persons with an immigrant background can be included in this concept, are looked at. Second, with regard to the content of the protection, the emphasis is put on two aspects of the Convention which appear particularly significant, namely inter-cultural dialogue and democratic participation."
"February 22, 2010","Using the political conflict in Peru as a case study, the author argues that the thesis that rape is a weapon of war obscures other rape regimes during political conflict. These include rape as consumption, opportunistic rape, rape by neighbors or family members, forced prostitution and rape in the aftermath of war. Neglect of forms of sexual violence that do not fit the rape-as-a-weapon-of-war script seriously impedes the transformative potential of processes of transitional justice, as it allows for the continuation of (sexual) violence against women that perpetuates hierarchies based on gender, race and class."
"February 22, 2010","This article examines attitudes among soldiers in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina - many of whom stood on opposing sides of the war front over a decade ago - toward the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It is based on an anonymous survey of 463 soldiers conducted in five Bosnian cities: Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla, Banja Luka and Bijeljina. The author finds that soldiers believe the Court has made some successes toward its extended mandate, in particular in its contribution to various aspects of democratization. Court architects hoped war crimes trials would bolster the prospects for long-term peace and stability in the country. This article addresses a segment of society not often given voice in scholarly studies of transitional justice and adds to the growing scholarship on former combatants."
"February 22, 2010","National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are routinely described as a bridge between the international and domestic systems of human rights protection. But little attention has been paid to how NHRIs actually apply treaty standards at the national level. This article argues that recent innovations in human rights treaties-whereby national-level institutions are assigned an explicit role in treaty implementation-crystallise developments in the practice of NHRIs and treaty bodies over the past 15 years or so. NHRIs invoke international standards in their monitoring and case-handling, they audit legislation for compliance with international law and, after an initial period of unclarity, they have become increasingly involved in independent reporting to treaty monitoring bodies. An analysis of 69 founding statutes of NHRIs shows a growing trend to assign these institutions mandates derived from international standards. Despite some marginal differences in the practice of NHRIs in ‘monist’ and ‘dualist’ jurisdictions, traditional doctrinal distinctions in the incorporation of international law appear to have little impact on the role that these institutions play."
"February 22, 2010","A report published by the Consultative Group on the Past (Consultative Group) in January 2009 recommended that a ‘Legacy Commission’ be established for Northern Ireland that would fulfil a reconciliation, truth-recovery and justice mandate. The work of the Consultative Group highlights how international justice norms are interpreted at a local level in a way that takes account of local histories and priorities. This article critically examines the proposed Legacy Commission and finds that the framework outlined by the Consultative Group does not sufficiently challenge discourses of violence that hinder the bedding down of positive peace in Northern Ireland. Universal human rights and justice concepts remain peripheral to this framework, which avoids the type of profound conflict analysis that might advance societal stability and harmony. Instead of challenging the structural and institutional inequalities that underpinned the violence of the conflict in Northern Ireland and opening up new pathways to accessing truth and justice, the Consultative Group's report advocates a truth-recovery process that is not open to public scrutiny and is couched in the language of forgetting, which begs the question whether this is a genuine attempt to explore sidelined or dissenting narratives of conflict, or merely another forum in which to contain them."
"February 22, 2010","The late Thomas Franck postulated that the legitimacy of international norms and institutions rested in large part upon certain important factors, notably whether the norm or institutional process was validated through commonly accepted means, whether it was clearly understood by those upon whom it operated, whether it cohered with other norms and institutions, and whether it was well-grounded in secondary rules of international law concerning law formation. This article argues that the proposed draft amendment to the Rome Statute on the crime of aggression does not fare well under these criteria, casting into doubt the long-term prospects for the legitimacy of the definition of the crime and of the institutional structures charged with administering it. Choices made at the ICC Review Conference in 2010 to finalize an amendment to the Rome Statute may help alleviate or aggravate these concerns."
"February 22, 2010","Book Review of Judith Butler's Frames of War."
"February 22, 2010","Current empirical growth models limit the determinants of country growth to geographic, economic, and institutional variables. This study draws on conflict variables from the Correlates of War (COW) project to ask a critical question: How do different types of conflict affect country growth rates? It finds that wars slow the economy. Estimates indicate that civil war reduces annual growth by .01 to .13 percentage points, and high-intensity interstate conflict reduces annual growth by .18 to 2.77 percentage points. On the other hand, low-intensity conflict slows growth much less than high-intensity conflict, and may slightly increase it. The detrimental effect of conflict on growth is intensified when examining non-democracies, low income countries, and countries in Africa."
"February 22, 2010","This article analyzes the advances and limitations of transitional justice efforts in democratic Chile through the examination of a key political actor: the armed forces. The military's earlier attitude of denial and noncooperation regarding the human rights violations of the Pinochet dictatorship (1973-1990) was slowly replaced by dialogue with civilians, institutional recognition of violations and limited cooperation with courts. While strategic interactions with other political actors and generational/personnel change stand out as variables explaining the military's behavioral and ideational transformation, the article highlights a crucial third factor: the pluralization of truth and justice mechanisms, both domestic and overseas, that opened up juridical, political and societal fields of contestation against impunity and amnesia. None of Chile's major political actors, including the military, could exert full control over these multiple channels of truth and justice, and the result was the adoption of new strategies and legitimizing discourses more in line with the human rights norm. The military reoriented its stance on human rights in the context of Pinochet's arrest in London in 1998, a changing political environment and the judicial battle over amnesties for the dictatorship's abuses."
"February 22, 2010","This article reflects on the recent Chilean experience of accountability actions, particularly the attempted prosecution of perpetrators of past human rights violations. While acknowledging the undoubtedly substantial impulse provided by the dramatic October 1998 UK arrest of former dictator Augusto Pinochet, it focuses on domestic actors and drivers in a post-1998 revival of such attempts. The article examines the extent and limitations of recent change in the area of prosecutions in Chile, noting that these have been undertaken at the insistence of private actors rather than the state. It also notes that the self-amnesty law of 1978 is still textually intact despite advances in restricting its application with regards to certain categories of internationally proscribed crimes. Finally, the article examines some explanatory factors for both recent advances and remaining blockages in the Chilean human rights accountability scenario."
"February 22, 2010","2008 marked the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Genocide Convention and Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the UN General Assembly. These two instruments adopted and proclaimed by the then newly formed world body on successive days, 9 and 10 December 1948 respectively, represent two sides of one coin. Born of the horrors of the 1930s and 1940s, the United Nations Charter speaks of human rights and to the importance of the rule of law. The Genocide Convention and UDHR are integral to the pursuit of these aims. The work of two international lawyers, Hersch Lauterpacht and Raphael Lemkin, whose personal and familial histories traverse the tragedies of 20th century Europe, was instrumental in the realization of these twin efforts. This article examines their respective contributions to contemporary international law by concentrating on their European experience from their youth in Central Europe and the early days of the League of Nations to their mature work up to and including the Nuremberg Judgment."
"February 22, 2010","Little in-depth research has been conducted on or attention paid to the experience and opinions of survivors regarding issues such as reparation, justice, reconciliation and truth in dealing with the aftermath of atrocities. Less still has been said of the way in which victims’ identities impact on these views or are considered in the design of programs aimed at redress for past violations. This article focuses on Guatemala's National Reparations Program (PNR) as critically viewed by Mayan Q’eqchi’ victims. The Q’eqchi’ are the second-largest Mayan group in the country and among the most severely affected by the internal armed conflict of 1960 to 1996. In Guatemala, the dominant culture is nonindigenous, although the majority of the population is indigenous Maya. This raises the complex issue of the actual and potential role of cultural context in dealing with grave human rights violations. In this regard, it is pertinent to establish how reparation is understood in different cultural contexts and to question how governmental reparations programs take these contexts into account. The results of extensive ethnographic field research conducted between 2006 and 2009 reveal the need for a locally rooted and culturally sensitive PNR."
"February 22, 2010","In February 2009, the International Criminal Court's Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression concluded its efforts to draft the ‘provision’ called for in Article 5(2) of the Rome Statute ‘defining the crime [of aggression] and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime’. It produced two draft Articles: Article 8bis, the ‘definition’, and Article 15bis, the ‘conditions’. There was substantial agreement on the definition (and on ‘Elements’ of the crime produced in June 2009); there was much disagreement concerning the conditions. The author examines the most significant drafting issues. For the definition, these include: applying General Assembly Resolution 3314 to individual responsibility; articulating the ‘leadership’ nature of this crime; the threshold requirement that the violation of the United Nations Charter be ‘manifest’; and consistency with provisions in the Statute, especially those in the ‘general part’. In respect of conditions, the difficult issue surrounds the role of the Security Council and the many variations on that theme in draft Article 15bis. The contribution concludes with a fundamental procedural question: can the amendment be applied erga omnes or does it apply only to those states specifically accepting it?"
"February 22, 2010","The International Court of Justice's decision on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) has exposed the unforeseen irony in the international consensus on the singular distinction of genocide as the crime of crimes. Defying expectations, this classification coupled with the conception of a ‘civil genocide’ has magically transformed into a legal shield which protects states from responsibility even as individual convictions are being handed down. Yet, the history of the Genocide Convention easily recalls the objective of preventing the commission of genocide by states and individuals alike. This article thus ponders on the virtue of seeking recourse under the Genocide Convention - whether against the state or the individual. In traversing this inquiry, it embarks on a comparative analysis of selected case law from the International Criminal Tribunal of Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda, and the International Court of Justice. As it uncovers a counterintuitive clash of jurisprudential outcome and a widening gap between the ideal and the real, the article identifies the legal bolts which need to be adjusted so that the genocide stops can be pulled in the right direction."
"February 22, 2010","This short article honours Professor Raphael Lemkin (1900-1959), author of the term ‘genocide’ and initiator of the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death. The article provides a brief overview of his career in international law and highlights Professor Lemkin′s key ideas which shaped the Genocide Convention."
"February 22, 2010","European participation in controversial aspects of the ‘war on terror’ has transformed the question of the extraterritorial scope of the European Convention on Human Rights from abstract doctrine into a question with singularly pressing political and legal ramifications. Yet the European Court of Human Rights has failed clearly to articulate when and why signatory states’ extraterritorial actions can be brought within the jurisdiction of the European Convention. The Court has veered between a narrow view of extraterritorial jurisdiction confined to four fixed categories of cases and a broader view which contemplates extraterritorial jurisdiction when a signatory state effectively controls an individual's ability to exercise fundamental Convention rights. Scholars have favoured the latter, arguing that the universality of human rights demands an expansive concept of extraterritorial jurisdiction. This article proposes a different theory: existing categories of extraterritorial jurisdiction can best be understood as limited exceptions to the rule of territorial jurisdiction because they all require some significant connection between a signatory state's physical territory and the individual whose rights are implicated. Properly understood, extraterritorial jurisdiction under the European Convention is and should be limited to such situations to maintain a workable balance between the Convention's regional identity and its universalist aspirations."
"February 22, 2010","The article is a critique of the proposal for the codification of the crime of aggression by the Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression. It concentrates on four main points - the inherent indeterminacy of the definition of aggression, its uncertain application to recent cases concerning the use of force, the involvement of the Security Council in the exercise of jurisdiction, and, finally, the danger of concentrating issues of jus in bello and jus contra bellum in one single court or tribunal. The contribution concludes that the time is not ripe for a codification of the crime of aggression at a time at which the Court is still struggling to establish itself."
"February 22, 2010","While the EU is as beset as ever by internal divisions, European elites’ ambitions for strengthening integration now revolve around greater foreign policy engagement and effectiveness. This is the central paradox of the Lisbon Treaty: an arrangement supposed to legitimize further integration through foreign policy success at a time when Europe is sorely divided over domestic as well as foreign policy. What gave rise to this glaring disconnect between reality and ambitions and what is this likely to mean for the EU in the next decade?"
"February 22, 2010","This paper characterizes the efficient sequential equilibrium when a government uses indirect control to exert its authority. We develop a dynamic principal-agent model in which a principal (a government) delegates the prevention of a disturbance—such as riots, protests, terrorism, crime, or tax evasion—to an agent who has an advantage in accomplishing this task. Our setting is a standard dynamic principal-agent model with two additional features. First, the principal is allowed to exert direct control by intervening with an endogenously determined intensity of force which is costly to both players. Second, the principal suffers from limited commitment. Using recursive methods, we derive a fully analytical characterization of the likelihood, intensity, and duration of intervention. The first main insight from our model is that repeated and costly interventions are a feature of the efficient equilibrium. This is because they serve as a punishment to induce the agent into desired behavior. The second main insight is a detailed analysis of a fundamental tradeoff between the intensity and duration of intervention which is driven by the principal’s inability to commit. Finally, we derive sharp predictions regarding the impact of various factors on likelihood, intensity, and duration of intervention. We discuss these results in the context of some historical episodes."
"February 22, 2010","The intergenerational elasticity of income is considered one of the best measures of the degree to which a society gives equal opportunity to its members. While much research has been devoted to measuring this reduced-form parameter, less is known about its underlying structural determinants. Using a model with exogenous talent endowments, endogenous parental investment in children and endogenous redistributive institutions, we identify the structural parameters that govern the intergenerational elasticity of income. The model clarifies how the interaction between private and collective decisions determines the equilibrium level of social mobility. Two societies with similar economic and biological fundamentals may have vastly different degrees of intergenerational mobility depending on their political institutions. We offer empirical evidence in line with the predictions of the model. We conclude that international comparisons of intergenerational elasticity of income are not particularly informative about fairness without taking into account differences in politico-economic institutions."
"February 22, 2010","In the course of recent years, the Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression has prepared the ground for a final political decision to be made in Kampala in 2010. This symposium will hopefully constitute a useful contribution to the comprehensive debate that is necessary in order to enable the political leaders to make their choice in an informed manner. This article argues that there are no compelling policy reasons against allowing the International Criminal Court to exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which already forms part of customary international law. In particular, there is no compelling reason for not reflecting the co-existence of the jus contra bellum and the jus in bello on the secondary level of international criminal law and international criminal justice. While the definition contained in the Draft amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on the Crime of Aggression is imperfect in some respects, it constitutes a reasonable and workable compromise which, on a somewhat closer inspection, proves to be much more determinate than it may seem at first glance. In light of this achievement and the unlikelihood of the emergence of a magic formula for a perfect definition, this article takes the view that the window of opportunity which will be open in Kampala should be used because otherwise it may be closed for a very long time. The 2010 Review Conference should therefore mark the historic occasion on which state leaders eventually form the collective will to allow for the prosecution of the most serious violations of the jus contra bellum and hereby to complete the new system of permanent international criminal justice."
"February 21, 2010","Within the context of massive and serious human rights violations prevalent in Eritrea, the right to leave one’s own country of many Eritreans between 10 to 50 years old is severely curtailed; thus giving rise to the apt designation of Eritrea as ‘open air prison’. Fraught by the overall repression of human rights, in spite of the draconian restrictions on the right to leave, thousands of Eritrean youths are, however, fleeing Eritrea every year in a manner the Government of Eritrea (GoE) calls ‘illegal’. As the fleeing youths are undeniable testimony of the repressive nature of the GoE, the latter has resorted to deadly measures of blocking the boarders of the country and severely punishing apprehended attempters and deportees. The fact that the GoE ill treats apprehended attempters and deportees with no reference to due process of law has given rise to acceptable cause for asylum when the latter successfully flee Eritrea. Thus, ironically the curtailment of the right to leave Eritrea has resulted to new refugee population from Eritrea. This article analyzes the twin rights to leave and return to one’s own country as provided in three human rights treaties binding upon Eritrea; finds sever violation of these rights in Eritrea and calls the GoE to respect the twin rights of its youths. Nevertheless, without drastically improving the democratic deficiencies in the country’s manners of governance the GoE cannot stop the exodus of Eritrean youths which would be aggravated when the GoE attempts to respect the twin rights alone. Therefore, a call for respect of these rights is a suggestion for remedying the main cause of the exodus – the human rights crisis and democratic deficiencies in Eritrea."
"February 21, 2010","Since September 11, 2001, the majority of “national security” cases to make it to the Supreme Court have dealt with America’s military strategy in the War on Terrorism - namely our policies at Guantanamo Bay.  Although these cases have focused on detention authority and due process rights in a time of war, they represent only one facet of what is at least a two-front war. Alongside our military efforts, the United States has been engaged in domestic law enforcement to target international terrorist groups long before September 11th."
"February 21, 2010","The opportunities that the Internet brings for civil society groups, from information dissemination to deliberation and from service delivery to mobilization have led scholars to anticipate it to be a critical resource for communication and collaboration with its stakeholders. However, such studies on the breadth and level of use remain limited, mostly on transnational or developed country NGOs, or focused on a few exceptional cases. This exploratory study aims to contribute to the still scant body of empirical evidences through an analysis of the websites of 193 non-government organizations (NGOs) in the Philippines. This study investigates the website features of Philippine."
"February 20, 2010","In this paper I discuss broadly the context of environmental, economic, social and cultural rights, analysing particularly the connections and synergies between these rights, and their potential to promote sustainable use of natural resources, and therefore development in Southern Africa. In the next section I trace the conceptual history, content and scope of economic, social, and cultural rights (“ESCRs”) and then in the third part I show how these got intertwined with environmental rights in a complimentary role. Part four discusses the challenges being faced in promoting, protecting and fulfilling EESCRs in Southern Africa, and Africa broadly; and then in the fifth part I offer possible solutions that can see an improvement in the protection of EESCRs. I conclude the paper by highlighting issues that need further study and that can be pursued by public interest environmental organisations. So what exactly do we mean by social, economic, and cultural rights? Is there a shared understanding of the scope and legal content of these rights? Should these rights be the subject of legal protection or rather should we leave them to policy makers and politicians who are mandated with the task of governing and distributing resources as they deem fit? What is it that law and the courts can do to ensure effective fulfilment of these rights?"

"February 20, 2010","Some societies appear to be better equipped than others to implement efficiency enhancing policy reforms and to deliver positive results out of their implementation. Our model presents an under-examined element of policy reform and institutional quality, showing how the characteristics of the political system may render citizens unable to properly reward politicians who implement new projects, thus favoring politicians who secure the status quo, albeit mediocre, of the economy. In such an environment, new policy projects are sidelined and political institutional quality remains inert. Political institutions matter because they affect the value for the politicians of staying in office. We show that societies with a suboptimal political system may present institutional bias towards the status quo. This bias arises due to the inability of the citizens to design an effective voting rule that induces politicians to implement new projects successfully."

"February 20, 2010","The primary justification that is normally given for going to war is defensive. If one country attacks another country it is permissible for the second country to defend itself against the attack by the first.

Work on defensive war now probably outstrips work on self-defence in the philosophy of criminal law in sophistication."

"February 18, 2010","The literature has come to no agreement about the empirical validity of the so-called weak government hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, political fragmentation should lead to higher government expenditure. With the aim of reconciling the empirical evidence with theory, in this paper we discuss and test a new hypothesis about this relationship: that fragmentation should matter for public spending only to the extent that the degree of polarization is high enough. Our results for a sample of presidential democracies show that a marginal change in the level of fragmentation in the governing coalition affects positively the size of the budget, but only if there is some degree of polarization. We also find that what matters for fiscal policy in presidential democracies is the degree of fragmentation and polarization within the governing coalition, rather than in the legislature at large. For parliamentary democracies we find erratic patterns for the relationship between fragmentation and public spending. Our results suggest interesting differences between presidential and parliamentary systems."
"February 18, 2010","This introduction provides a brief overview of the existing OMC literature with regard to the introduction of the OMC, its theoretical conceptualisation of effectiveness and legitimacy and related empirical findings. The main part of the introduction, however, focuses on chosen shortcomings of the literature and how the contributions to this special issue deal with these shortcomings and contribute to surmounting them. In particular, the central assumption about learning is questioned at macro-, meso- and micro levels; potential ways, apart from learning, as to how the OMC can 'matter' are explored as well as the impacts it has. Finally, the assumption that the OMC could be a neutral instrument is questioned, and doubts are therefore raised as to its legitimacy."

Section II gives an overview of the development of the international cooperation in competition policy and law and an insight into its achievements and challenges. Section III takes a closer look at the perspectives of a global strategy by giving further details how cooperation could be designed."
"February 18, 2010","There are fears that the development of a Europe of Variable Geometry, where distinct countries are able to select their policy preferences from a menu of historical policy options rather than signing up for new policy initiatives, provides a basis for destabilizing the European Project. However, the paper shows that this fear has no real basis. The reason is that when the political processes of the Project are considered in terms of political culture, two culturally based political factions can be argued to have emerged in Europe. Here, the distinct variable cultural positions actually stabilise the interactive political process. A detailed explanation of this is provided through both historical processes and the use of well developed theory."
"February 17, 2010","This article explores the treatment of detainees in treaty and customary international humanitarian law. Detainees are persons who do not or have ceased to take a direct part in hostilities or are hors de combat. It contextualizes the discussion on the treatment of detainees by illustrating an example from contemporary Slovenian history relating to the barbaric treatment of detainees on the Slovenian territory after Second World War, where more than one hundred thousand persons were executed. This article argues that fundamental human rights apply in all situations and that the fundamental guarantees apply during and after the hostilities to all categories of detainees. In this way, it further explores fundamental guarantees, a meeting point between international human rights law and humanitarian law. Based on these findings this article argues that there are strong legal and moral grounds to address crimes against humanity committed in Slovenia against detainees after the Second World War."
"February 16, 2010","This Essay discusses the recent Senate apology for slavery, which contained an unusual disclaimer prohibiting its use in any claim for monetary reparations. The Essay discusses the role of apology within the slavery reparations debate generally and the question of whether a stand-alone apology can be a valid form of reparation. It examines the particular moral and symbolic effects of the Senate disclaimer and offers some suggestions for bolstering the apology and furthering the restorative justice goals of reparations through additional symbolic gestures, like official commemoration of Juneteenth."
"February 16, 2010","How should national human rights institutions assess themselves? This report reviews the characteristics of effective national institutions and the international standards for their work, set out in the Paris Principles. It proposes benchmarks, based on these Principles, and suggests how quantitative and qualitative indicators can help institutions to improve their performance and measure the impact of their activities. Assessing the Effectiveness of National Human Rights Institutions is a practical tool for use by members and staff of national institutions, and organisations and individuals that work with them."

"February 16, 2010","The private sector increasingly accepts that it has social and moral responsibilities. In recent years many companies have introduced codes of conduct and other forms of voluntary initiatives. But do private companies have a legal responsibility to respect human rights? In the last 50 years the world’s governments, particularly through the United Nations, have agreed dozens of standards that define and guarantee basic human rights and freedoms. To what extent might these standards – originally aimed at states – create binding legal obligations on companies?"
"February 16, 2010","Despite the role women play in job creation, economic growth and society revitalization, especially in economies undergoing fundamental transformations, issues emerging from women in entrepreneurship have not received adequate attention in academic research. As a result, our understanding of women entrepreneurship in emerging markets as well as in nontraditional industries is even more limited. In this study, I attempt to partially fill the gap by comparing entrepreneurial orientations and venture performance between men and women entrepreneurs in electronics industry in Chinese transition economy. I offer insights gained from statistical analyses based on a survey as well as case study. Results reveal that while women are influenced by the same factors that affect decision making among men and exhibit some similarities, they differ from men in their willingness to take more risks and make bolder moves in pursuit of greater returns and future competitive advantage. In addition, women entrepreneurs outperform their male counterparts. I compare these findings with existing literature and offer suggestions for future research."

"February 16, 2010","Current and proposed greenhouse gas cap-and-trade systems allow regulated entities to offset abatement requirements by paying unregulated entities to abate. These offsets from unregulated entities are believed to contain system costs and stabilize allowance prices. However, the supply of offsets is highly uncertain. Furthermore, the offset supply uncertainty may be correlated with other sources of uncertainty in emissions trading systems. This paper presents a model that incorporates both uncertainties in the supply of offsets and in abatement costs. Using numerical methods we solve the model under a variety of parameter settings, including a system that includes allowance price controls. We find that as uncertainty in offsets and uncertainty in abatement costs become more negatively correlated, expected abatement plus offset purchase costs increase, as does the variability in allowance prices and emissions from the regulated sector. Imposing an allowance price collar that limits the upper and lower cost substantially mitigates cost increases as well as the variability in prices and emissions, while roughly maintaining expected environmental outcomes."
"February 16, 2010","In recent years, governments and international organisations have taken many initiatives to reduce corruption. However, the issue has rarely been analysed from the point of view of human rights. Therefore, in 2007 the Council commenced a project focused on the connection between corruption and human rights. The project aims to assist organisations that prosecute or support anti-corruption policies to apply human rights effectively to strengthen their programmes; to make human rights bodies and mechanisms more accessible to those who work to end corruption; and to make anti-corruption methods and practices more accessible to human rights advocates."

"February 16, 2010","The introduction of a price on carbon dioxide will have important effects on the U.S. economy, and especially important effects on the electricity sector, which currently accounts for about 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. This paper examines alternative approaches to the distribution of allowance value to the sector, including free allocation to consumers through electricity and natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs). Recent proposals in the U.S. Congress, including H.R. 2454, have suggested this option as a way to address impacts on consumers and potential regional inequities. We compare allocation to electricity LDCs with a system in which allowances are auctioned and revenues returned to households as a per capita dividend. We evaluate the outcomes under alternative assumptions about how LDCs, which are regulated entities, pass through the allowance value to final residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Our results show that the LDC approach raises the price of allowances and imposes greater costs on households than the per capita dividend option. We also evaluate a more complete characterization of H.R. 2454 and show that an incremental reform to that bill would greatly reduce costs and have more balanced impacts across households in different income groups and regions."

"February 16, 2010","This report examines the factors that make aid programmes successful or not. Based on interviews with beneficiaries in four countries, it examines aid programmes to the justice sector. The information gathered suggests that such aid has facilitated constitutional development and legislative reforms, helped strengthen justice systems, and introduced human rights concepts to the public and into public institutions in societies where such notions were once seen as subversive. At the same time, badly conceived and implemented programmes have sheltered repressive regimes from scrutiny, wasted vital resources and distorted domestic institutions. Donors sometimes promote inappropriate models and put their foreign policy interests before human rights. They can be unreliable partners, subject to quick fixes and too much attention on “exit strategies”."

"February 16, 2010","In 2007, the International Court of Justice defined the scope of state responsibility under the Genocide Convention for the very first time when it reached the merits in the Genocide Case, a case arising from the violent breakup of the former Yugoslavia. The opinion immediately spurred extensive academic commentary, much of which was critical of the Court’s ultimate holding that Serbia had not committed genocide despite its well-documented role in the Srebrenica massacre. While the Genocide Case can be read as a disappointment, and the Court’s analysis is vulnerable to normative critique, this Note argues that it was nonetheless an important victory in the movement toward greater state accountability for genocide, especially considering the context in which the Court acts and the limitations imposed on its independence by the practical need for legitimacy. Although the Court raised onerous evidentiary hurdles for establishing state responsibility for the direct commission of genocide, it managed simultaneously to impose upon states a clear duty to rein in non-state actors over whom they exercise influence by interpreting the state obligation to prevent genocide broadly. This broad duty to rein in non-state actors has important implications not only for the Court’s own jurisprudence but also extrajudiciously within the customary framework of state responsibility, by empowering the general international community to enforce states’ obligations to curb genocidal actors within their reach."
"February 16, 2010","Have human rights organisations responded adequately to the threat of international terrorism and official responses to that threat? This report reaffirms that the core mission of human rights advocates is to make sure that governments respect human rights and the rule of law. But fresh thinking is also needed. Human rights organisations should participate in efforts to agree a sound definition of terrorism in international law. A victim-centred approach might enable them to apply human rights to a wider range of issues, making their advocacy more relevant to those who suffer because of terrorist violence. The report discusses how advocates might develop principled but also more understandable positions when they talk about terrorism to officials and the public or those who sympathise with it."

"February 15, 2010","This article represents the first serious attempt to compare Scottish policing with other British municipal police and improvement models between 1800 and 1835. It is concerned with assessing whether the Scottish experience was distinct from other parts of the United Kingdom and the implications of this for British police historiography and typology. It argues that the Scottish model was much closer to English experience than has hitherto been contended, but which, nonetheless, had distinguishing characteristics tailored to meet specific indigenous needs, customs and practices. Any attempt to construct a British police typology must move beyond the institutional confines of accountability and organization and take account of legal, cultural and intellectual structures and influences."
"February 15, 2010","Information can be provided by studying and evaluating past emergencies and the response in connection to them. This information would then be useful in efforts directed at preventing, mitigating and/or preparing for future emergencies. However, the analysis and evaluation of emergency response operations is not an easy task, especially when the operation involves several cooperating actors (e.g. the fire and rescue services, the police, the emergency medical services, etc.). Here, we identify and discuss four aspects of this challenge: (1) issues related to the values governing the evaluation, (2) issues related to the complexity of the systems involved, (3) issues related to the validity of the information on which the analysis and evaluation is based and (4) issues related to the limiting conditions under which the emergency response system operated. An outline of a framework for such an analysis and evaluation, influenced by systems theory, accident investigation theories and programme evaluation theories dealing with the above aspects, is introduced, discussed and exemplified using empirical results from a case study. We conclude that the proposed framework may provide a better understanding of how an emergency response system functioned during a specific operation, and help to identify the potential events and/or circumstances that could significantly affect the performance of the emergency response system, either negatively or positively. The insights gained from using the framework may allow the actors involved in the response operation to gain a better understanding of how the emergency response system functioned as a whole, as well as how the actors performed as individual components of the system. Furthermore, the information can also be useful for actors preparing for future emergencies."

"February 15, 2010","This paper deals with the question how today’s globalized forms of terrorism can be understood in their organizational dimension. Starting from the estimation that existing  concepts (e.g., hierarchy, network, or social movement) are limited in comprehending these new forms of terrorist organizing, we propose an alternative perspective on organizations as being more adequate: the communication-as-constitutive of organizations perspective (CCO; Ashcraft, Kuhn & Cooren, 2009; Putnam & Nicotera, 2009). Based on the CCO perspective, terrorist organizations can be conceptualized as essentially consisting of communicative events which necessitate to become interconnected over time. Keeping in mind this rather ephemeral notion of organizations, CCO points our attention to the constitutive conditions which allow for the emergence and stabilization of terrorist organizing. We finally derive suggestions on how to destabilize the continuous reproduction of terrorist organizing practices."
"February 15, 2010","It is no longer a revelation that companies have some responsibility to uphold human rights. However, delineating the boundaries of the relationship between business and human rights is more vexed. What is it that we are asking corporations to assume responsibility for and how far does that responsibility extend? This article focuses on the extent to which economic, social and cultural rights fall within a corporation’s sphere of responsibility. It then analyses how corporations may be held accountable for violations of such rights. Specifically, the article considers the use of soft law as a protective mechanism; it also details how victims of harmful corporate behaviour are using litigation (pursuant to ATCA and common law domestic causes of action) to seek redress and recognition of the harms they have directly or indirectly experienced. The article concludes with an analysis of Professor Ruggie’s (the United Nations Special Representative on the issue of transnational corporations and human rights) 2008 and 2009 Reports in which it is suggested that a respect-based framework must be interpreted as imposing proactive requirements on companies to prevent the infringement of human rights. Future efforts must also be directed towards the recognition of a specialised complementary corporate responsibility to protect human rights."
"February 15, 2010","In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, the focus of this chapter, the mining boom - or the 'ramp up' in production as it is referred to within the industry - is such that negotiations for land access have intensified and annual payments to the Indigenous organisations examined here have increased threefold since 1997. These organisations are the Gumala Aboriginal Corporation (Gumala) and Gumala Investments Pty Ltd (GIPL); set up to manage the Yandicoogina Agreement (YLUA). This chapter critically examined the mechanisms through which Indigenous beneficiaries are able to articulate to a Land Use Agreement (LUA) as individuals, with specific attention to possibilities for entrepreneurial acticity. The range of possibilities for direct and tangible benefits from agreements is a key area of Indigenous concern.  Because of the complexity of the land use agreements examined for this project, this chapter will only focus on Rio Tinto's YLUA in the Hamersley Ranges of the Pilbara.  Indigenous 'beneficiaries' operate in a politically volatile and economically expansive context in this area of engagement with the mining sector and the organisations developed to manage the agreements."
"February 15, 2010","This paper analyzes empirically whether the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), advocating the multiple dimensions of women’s rights, affects the level of women’s rights in a country. Measuring commitments to the CEDAW based on reservations by member states, I test whether the Convention enhances women’s rights; in particular, (i) whether the effects are stronger if a member country has a higher level of democracy; and (ii) whether the effects are most pronounced in the dimension of women’s social rights, a special focus of the Convention. Using panel data for 126 countries during 1981-2007, I do not find statistically significant effects of the CEDAW alone on any dimension of women’s rights. However, I do find a positive impact of the CEDAW on women’s social rights if combined with a higher degree of democracy. These findings are robust to the choice of control variables and the method of estimation. In particular, taking into account the potential reverse causality does not alter the main conclusions."

"February 15, 2010","Recent research including a prominent article in this journal has argued that America’s longstanding foreign policy orientation of liberal internationalism has been in serious decline because of rising domestic partisan divisions. We question the theoretical logic and empirical evidence driving this argument.  We reanalyze extant evidence on congressional roll call voting and public opinion surveys, which is often used to support the claim that liberal internationalism has declined.  We also analyze new evidence about partisan divisions in Congress using policy gridlock and co-sponsorship data from other studies of American politics. We do not observe the decline in bipartisanship in foreign policy that conventional wisdom suggests. We also find no evidence of a Vietnam War or a post Cold War effect on domestic partisan divisions on foreign policy. Unlike much of the recent literature, we argue that growing domestic political divisions over foreign policy have not made liberal internationalism impossible.  It persists as a possible grand strategy for the US in part because of globalization pressures."
"February 15, 2010","Highly-educated individuals are over-represented among violent operatives of insurgent organizations in the Middle East. This suggests four inter-related questions: (1) Why do those who seem to have good prospects willingly endanger their own lives? (2) What incentives drive these highly educated individuals to terrorist organizations in particular? (3) Why do sub-state welfare organizations turn violent? (4) Why do these organizations send so many highly educated, thoroughly dedicated members to their deaths instead of employing them in some other way? We answer these questions using a multidisciplinary approach, organized in a supply-demand framework, to study the market for violent operatives. We show how the conditions of a failing state give extra salience to personal significance for highly educated but dispossessed individuals and raise their value as violent operatives, creating gains from trade between them and the leaders of extremist organizations."
"February 15, 2010","Academic literature repeatedly calls for the EU's accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 (hereinafter Convention1). Similarly, the Lisbon Treaty provides that the EU must accede to the Convention. [Correction made here after initial online publication.] This might seem odd as the European Court of Justice (hereinafter ECJ2) has over the years developed abundant case-law on human rights protection in the EU, and the EU has not so long ago adopted a, albeit non-binding, catalogue of human rights (the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (hereinafter Charter)). But after all these years, cases, and Treaty amendments, the EU is in fact going back to the ECJ's 1996 landmark opinion which recommended the EU's formal accession to the Convention,3 already proposed in 1979 by the Commission.4 One reason for this might be that, in the meantime, human rights issues have multiplied in the application of EU law, especially in areas such as the Second and Third Pillars where—at least initially—fewer human rights protection guarantees were foreseen."
"February 15, 2010","The United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone are about to conclude a bilateral agreement establishing an ad hoc criminal court to try persons allegedly responsible for the commission of serious crimes perpetrated during the Sierra Leone civil conflict. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, as envisaged, is a mixed tribunal. It will be composed of international and Sierra Leonean personnel and have jurisdiction both over international crimes and crimes prohibited under Sierra Leonean criminal law, thus notably differing from the International Criminal Tribunals for Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. This paper analyses the dual nature of the Special Court and the major consequences it entails."
"February 15, 2010","This article is concerned with the spectacle of crime in the ‘new’ South Africa. I offer a sociological explanation for why crime plays such an important role in governance in South Africa. I identify both continuities and shifts between the ‘old’ and ‘new’ techniques of rule, showing how the very construction of crime and controversies about measuring it are constituted by and constitutive of power relations within society. The interconnected themes that I address are the changing relationship between crime and politics as the African National Congress went from being a resistance organization to governing party and the changing relationship between crime and race. The period that my research covers is from 1976 to 2004."
"February 15, 2010","This paper attempts to answer the question: why do the police use deadly force in a democratic country? Police shootings in India are better known as encounters, a term that refers to a specific type of police contact-a spontaneous, unplanned ‘shoot-out’ between the police and alleged criminals, in which the criminal is usually killed, with few or no police injuries. The police use of deadly force remains largely unquestioned or unaccountable. This paper explores the wider structural and systemic factors that create conditions in which killing ‘hardened’ criminals seems to be the last resort for the police to gain some control in the fight against crime. Wider cultural and specifically police sub-cultural factors that make police killing of alleged criminals both feasible and acceptable in a democratic country are discussed. Based on a qualitative study of Mumbai police officers’ narratives accounting for use of deadly force, the paper draws upon wider policing literature in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, South Africa and certain Latin American countries to explain why this form of police violence occurs."
"February 13, 2010","In 1970 UNESCO adopted a convention intended to stem the flow of looted antiquities from developing countries to collections in art-importing countries. The majority of art-importing countries, including Britain, Germany, and Japan, refused to join the Convention. Contrary to other art-importing countries, and reversing its own traditionally-liberal policy, the United States endorsed the international regulation of antiquities and joined the UNESCO Convention. The article seeks to explain why the United States chose to establish controls on antiquities, to the benefit of foreign countries facing archaeological plunder and to the detriment of the US art market. I argue that the concern of US policymakers about looting abroad resulted from a series of scandals that exposed the involvement of American museums and collectors with looted material. Advocacy efforts of American archaeologists also played a key role in educating policymakers about the loss of historical knowledge caused by looting and the necessity of regulation. The article further analyzes how antiquities dealers and certain museums lobbied Congress against implementing the UNESCO Convention and why Congress decided in favor of implementation as an act of international moral leadership. Following the analysis of the Congressional battle, I examine how the US debate over looted antiquities has evolved to the present. The article concludes with implications for the role of values versus interests in international law."
"February 13, 2010","In the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo case the International Court of Justice has – for the first time in its history – found a state to have violated the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. For the first time also, the Court has discussed the scope of self-defence directly under Article 51. In this article the focus lies on this aspect of a wide-ranging judgment. In finding that Uganda had violated the Charter, the Court kept to its jurisprudence constante; it did not bow to 'post-11 September' pressure to extend the logic of Article 51 to private actors. This article discusses the merits of the scholarly claims for both sides, but warns of drawing conclusions for the Court's future jurisprudence – the apparent unity among judges may have to do more with the case rather than the wider issue."
"February 13, 2010","Recent literature establishes that ethnicity needs to be politically relevant to have a negative effect on a country’s development process. Yet, an understanding of the factors that cause ethnicity to be a political salient factor is still limited. This paper compares the development of the high politicization of ethnicity in Kenya to the low politicization in Tanzania by tracing the impact of ethnic structures, colonial administration, land distribution, and nation building policies on the politicization of ethnicity. Evidence from extensive archival material, historical secondary sources and expert interviews rejects the ethnic structure argument but supports the negative impact of colonial rule and land distribution, and the positive impact of nation building policies on the politicization of ethnicity. Indeed, fully implemented nation building policies, such as the promotion of Swahili and the intermingling of secondary school students, have the potential to lastingly mitigate the political salience of ethnicity."

Nobody doubts that the Charter permits self-defence, but the precise modalities of the right are unclear. This is not an exposé of the whole spectrum of issues that can arise or have arisen. Rather, the article considers a few examples and analyses the structure of the arguments scholars and tribunals employ in order to find out where our limits of ‘legal cognition’ lie. Several topics are examined, inter alia, whether an ‘armed attack’ is a necessary condition for the exercise of self-defence under the UN-Charter; the actions qualifying as armed attack; whether an armed attack has to occur or whether the victim state merely reasonably has to expect it to occur; and whether individuals can commit an armed attack. It will become clear throughout the article that the closer one looks at the law of self-defence, the less certain the law becomes. I submit that the uncertainty of the law on self-defence is caused by a lack of legal regulation – there is only so much that Article 51 can tell us. Scholars importing their own ideas of what scope self-defence should have do not enhance our understanding of the positive law, their designs simply are not law."
"February 12, 2010","Hicks, Thomas and Habib have alleged that Australian intelligence and law enforcement personnel were complicit in their torture while detained in the custody of Egypt, Pakistan and the United States. Following a review of Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Convention against Torture and Australian law concerning complicity in torture, this article argues that there are several significant substantive and procedural obstacles which collectively make it unlikely that the officers concerned will be prosecuted in Australia. Contemporary legislative amendments suggest that Australia did not consider the prohibition against torture as then implemented under Australian law to apply extraterritorially to cover the conduct of Australian officials abroad. The circumstances moreover suggest that exercising jurisdiction over Australians claiming to be victims of torture was not considered appropriate. Recent Australian jurisprudence indicates that, notwithstanding Article 15 of the Convention, admissions derived from torture may have been used against claimed torture victims during proceedings and for the purposes of gathering intelligence. The article proposes that, consistent with international trends, an investigation conducted by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security could exonerate the intelligence services, provide useful guidance for officers dealing with Australians detained overseas, improve inter-State intelligence-sharing arrangements and alleviate the risk of being found complicit in torture."

"February 12, 2010","The crisis since August 2007 provides an opportunity to observe the workings of good governance institutions under an extreme stress test and in radically different political settings. Institutions such as independent central banks, fiscal rules and regulatory oversight of public finances were meant to depoliticize macroeconomic stabilization. The comparison of responses to the crisis in the United States and in the European Union shows that good governance institutions are in crisis in the US while it has been a good crisis for governance so far in the EU. Levels of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing are surprisingly similar between the EU and the US, yet the ECB has maintained its independence and member states have been restrained from inserting protectionist elements in their stimulus measures. By contrast, the boundaries between economic stabilization and distributive politics have been wiped out in the US because neither the political forces in the states nor the economic forces in the financial sector erected many defences. In the EU, the boundaries as drawn are inimical to joint stabilization efforts but this is exactly why they are politically self-enforcing."

"February 11, 2010","Rwanda experienced several forms of internal violence, including civil war, genocide, reprisal killings and (counter-)insurgency. While these events all occurred in 1990-1998, their geographic location within Rwanda differred, with the genocide especially severe in the South of the country, the civil war and reprisal killings mostly taking place in the North and East, and the (counter-)insurgency concentrated in the Northwest. In order to assess the relative impact of the different forms of violence, this article derives a detailed spatial pattern of excess mortality from the population census. In line with previous evidence on the death toll of armed conflict in Rwanda, we find significant high-high excess mortality clusters in the southern province of Butare, in and around Kigali City, and in the eastern province Kibungo. Furthermore, we present the first quantitative evidence to date of high excess mortality in the northwestern porvince Gisenyi, indicating that the 1995-1998 (counter-)insurgency inflicted a much higher death toll on the population than presently acknowledged by the Rwandan government, the UN and large western donors."
"February 10, 2010","In this essay, Professor Konar-Steenberg argues that the current mortgage crisis bears striking similarities to the toxic waste crisis of the 1970s and 1980s, justifying an analogous legislative solution: A Superfund-style accountability regime for the subprime mortgage mess to complement the local, state, and federal economic cleanup measures already underway.  The essay notes the important similarities between the two crises, both of which involved risky and inadequately regulated commercial behavior whose negative consequences gutted entire communities. The essay argues that these similarities justify imposing the severe rules of Superfund-style liability – strict, retroactive, and joint-and-several liability, coupled with broad corporate liability options – in order to reach the many kinds of actors who had a hand in making the subprime mess."
"February 10, 2010","The modern tradition of constraining the power of political executives has deep roots in Anglo-American governmental traditions. The Magna Carta of 1215, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the Common Law, and other documents and traditions of the British Constitution all provided precedents upon which the Framers of the U.S. Constitution drew. From the ratification of the U.S. Constitution to contemporary times, the experience and precedents of the presidency have also played an important role in laying the basis for the legitimate authority exercised by the president in the constitutional system. This article will examine several actions of President George W. Bush and argue that he has made exceptional claims to presidential authority. Four instances of President Bush’s claims to presidential power will be examined: his suspension of the Geneva Conventions in 2002, his denial of the writ of habeas corpus for detainees in the war on terror, his order that the National Security Agency monitor messages to or from domestic parties in the United States without a warrant, and his use of signing statements."
"February 10, 2010","This article presents the first empirically based analysis of how judicial proceedings against perpetrators of human rights violations – criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuits – psychologically affect victims of those abuses. Policymakers, activists, and scholars frequently advance explicit or implicit claims about this impact, but generally offer no evidence to support them; at most, they provide a few anecdotes. This article combines insights from original interviews with therapists and lawyers with primary evidence from a comprehensive survey of published literature from social science research to personal memoirs."
"February 10, 2010","Consider a game whose strategies are ""contributions"". A strategy profile is a Kantian equilibrium if no player would like all players to alter their contributions by the same multiplicative factor. Kantian equilibria are Pareto efficient. We characterize the allocation rules on several domains of environments that can be implemented as Kantian equilibria. The concept unifies the proportional solution on production economies and the linear cost-share equilibrium on public-good economies. We study Kantian equilibrium in the prisoner's dilemma, in a voting problem, and in a political economy where redistribution is the issue. The Kantian dictum engenders considerable but not unqualified cooperation."
"February 10, 2010","This study explores the Palestinian martyrdom operations (Al-Amaliyat Al-Istishhadiya) between support and opposition. There are three main attitudes regarding the Palestinian martyrdom operations: support; against, while there are some calls for the rationalized of this phenomenon. The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has double standards: on one hand stresses the legal of Palestinian resistance to shake off the occupation, on the other hand condemns some martyrdom operations. The majority of the Palestinian street supports the martyrdom operations, as a national struggle against the Israeli occupation. Moreover, findings showed that martyrdom had become part of the Palestinian culture, which produced a large numbers of suicide martyrs (Istishhadiyin)."
"February 10, 2010","A government agency wants a facility to be built and managed to provide a public service. Two different modes of provision are considered. In a public-private partnership, the tasks of building and managing are bundled, while under traditional procurement, these tasks are delegated to separate private contractors. The two modes differ in their incentives to innovate and to gather private information about future costs to adapt the service provision to changing circumstances. Depending on the potential benefits of such adaptations, the government agency's preferred mode of provision may be different from the one that should be chosen from a welfare perspective."

"February 09, 2010","The U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires states to provide an effective remedy to indigenous peoples deprived of their cultural, religious, or intellectual property (IP) without their free, prior and informed consent. The Declaration could prove to be an important safeguard for the indigenous peoples of Iraq and Turkey, the victims for centuries of massacres, assaults on their religious and cultural sites, theft and deterioration of their lands and cultural objects, and forced assimilation. These peoples, among them the Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Yezidis of Turkey and Turkish-occupied Cyprus, and the Armenians, Assyrians, Yezidis, and Mandaeans of Iraq, have lost more than two-thirds of their peak populations, most of their cultural and religious sites, and thousands of priceless artifacts and specimens of visual art."
"February 09, 2010","Significant land development decisions have the potential to tear at the civic fabric of a community and cause irreversible environmental, aesthetic and economic harm. Conversely, these decisions also have the potential to rebuild and repair civic capacity with minimal impact and delivering significant community benefits. While the underlying facts of a development proposal and the conditions of the community are certainly factors in these different outcomes, the other, often overlooked, factor separating these outcomes is the process used to conceive, deliberate and decide what is included in a development. Through this article, the author uses four case studies featuring collaborative decision-making to explore the impact that process has on how parties interact in significant development decisions and how attorneys can play an important role as advocates for sound processes. Among the many distinguishing features of those cases is the use of a process manager with a stake in the outcome instead of an outside neutral. After examining the structure of the required process and looking at the four collaborative case studies, the author examines and organizes almost four decades of dispute resolution practice and theory to provide a concise set of recommendations for lawyers seeking to create better processes. This guidance will also help protect against abuses of power when hiring a mediator is not practicable."
"February 08, 2010","The central purpose of the paper is to explain the unleashing of racial discrimination and onslaught of racial violence on the migrated people in the context of Globalisation. Globalisation essentially means unification of the whole world economically, politically and socially; thus converting it into a global village where people living in two different poles become neighbours. The culture conflict among the migrated people has given a new meaning to the racism. The first part of the article gives a historical overview of the worldwide migration of people from the underdeveloped and developing nations to the developed nations in search of better living or to avoid conflicts in their homeland. The second part of the article tries to explain reason behind the rise of xenophobic structural racism in relation to migration and explain the racial discriminations in the light of “Structural racism” and “private discriminations” specially in the context of the 9/11 incident in America. The third part of the article tries to analyse the case of recent racial attacks on Indians in Australia from the perspective of globalisation. The article concludes that the globalisation process and associated migration has proved to be an essential tool in promoting racism in this 21st century rather than creating a friendly, multicultural society which is tolerant towards people from various cultures, races and religions."
"February 08, 2010","If a patient must pay a bribe to obtain life-saving surgery, does the doctor’s solicitation of a bribe represent a violation of the victim’s human rights? This paper explores the ways in which anti-corruption practitioners can look to various provisions in human rights law in order to prevent or prosecute corruption-related offences. We use Kosovo as a case study because its constitution gives direct effect to the major international human rights conventions. We find - using Kosovo as a case study - that some types of corruption lead to separately prosecutable human rights offences. We also find that pre-existing violations of human rights law create strong incentives for individuals to engage in corruption. We offer concrete suggestions to lawyers and prosecutors for using human rights provisions to encourage the prosecution corruption offences in highly corrupt countries like Kosovo. We also present a method of prosecuting human rights offences leading to - or resulting from - corruption as administrative offences and offer pricing  models for assessing the optimal fine for the human rights offences occurring concomitant with cases of corruption."
"February 07, 2010","Discrimination in today’s workplace is largely implicit, making it ambiguous and often very difficult to prove. Employment discrimination scholars have proposed reforms of Title VII to make implicit discrimination easier to establish in court and to expand the kinds of situations to which liability attaches. The reform proposals reflect a broad consensus that strong legal norms are crucial to addressing the problem. Yet it is mistaken to assume that strengthening plaintiffs’ hands in implicit discrimination cases will necessarily achieve the long-term goal of reducing its occurrence. This Article brings together several strands of social science research showing that (1) implicit bias is not only invisible and largely unintended, but not readily reachable through legal coercion; (2) people whose motivation to act in nondiscriminatory ways is based on an internal commitment to nondiscriminatory norms - or “good intentions” - are less likely to engage in stereotyping of others than people who feel pressured by the law; (3) people internalize nondiscrimination values best when they feel a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness; (4) the conditions that support these characteristics in the workplace include strong, unambiguous norms, trust, teamwork, leadership, positive example, and opportunities to grow and advance; and (5) excessive legal control and pressure undermine people’s sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness and thus their commitment to nondiscrimination norms."
"February 07, 2010","The present paper analyses how resource rents may affect political outcomes in a polarized society, where groups hold conflicting views on economic policy. A politically dominant group decides whether or not to include the opposition in the national political process. The weaker group chooses whether to remain in the union or secede. The analysis finds that the effect of resource rents on social and political outcomes depends on the social environment, in particular the degree of polarization in society. Moreover, the study shows that this relationship may be non-monotonic, with increases in resource wealth stimulating peaceful cooperation for some initial levels of wealth, and stimulating conflict and division for other initial levels of wealth."
"February 07, 2010","Are exports systematically associated with diplomatic representation abroad? Given the expenses of maintaining posts abroad, this question is obviously of deep interest to governments seeking to promote their country's export performance while coping with budgetary pressures. In a recent article, Andrew Rose found that posts abroad increase trade with each post adding 6-10 percent additional exports. We take up a question that immediately arises given Rose's findings: does it matter whether the host economy is economically ""free,"" in the sense that the host government intervenes little in economic decision making? This question is salient for an understanding of how posts abroad affect exports: do they serve primarily to help would-be exporters connect with private sector purchasers abroad (i.e., a ""networking"" role), or do they serve also or even mainly to reduce red-tape associated with government intervention in economic decisions abroad? To investigate this question, we construct a variable for representation abroad weighted by an index of economic freedom. We find that, using the same data base as Rose, the value of an additional post in an economically less free economy (e.g., China) is worth more in terms of a percentage increase in exports than one in a freer economy (e.g., New Zealand). Encouragingly, this specification of the foreign post variable improves the overall goodness of fit of the conventional gravity equation and increases the significance level of the parameter for posts. We conclude that  the value of a post abroad is to some extent based on the role of the foreign service in smoothing the interface with foreign governments, over and above any role the post might have in developing private-private networking."
"February 07, 2010","Youth in the West Bank and Gaza Strip grow up in the shadow of a political conflict that dominates their economic lives. Since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has nearly collapsed under the burden of occupation and conflict. The Israeli occupation brought a partial integration of the Palestinian labor force with the Israeli labor market, leading to increased job opportunities for some workers while at the same time fundamentally changing the structure of the Palestinian economy. The characteristics of the Palestinian economy under occupation have included a dearth of investment, weak job creation in the private sector, and limited opportunities for skilled workers. While the limited autonomy yielded to the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 1994 has revived some sectors of the economy, restrictions on trade and mobility continue to hobble Palestinian economic opportunities."
"February 06, 2010","A new approach to religion institutions is proposed. To adopt world society to era of highly developed science and technology we ought to put away social-Darwinistic social relations and organize humans/world society on three – by John Paul II proposed – universal values: common good/common interest, solidarity and subsidiarity. For life in such State of Change and Risk we have to activate big intellectual – cognitive and innovative – currently in most cases, passive creative potential and allow access to knowledge used up to-date usually for egoistic – business and/or political – purposes. For this end we have to change work force position from “tools like” into creative one. We have also to build world information system that especially will allow to get knowledge about future complex effects of human activity."
"February 06, 2010","Policy discussions of climate change have been primarily concerned about mitigating greenhouse gases. However, when adaptation to climate change is a global public good, an efficient allocation cannot be achieved by the imposition of a carbon tax alone to abate greenhouse gases. This paper proposes an alternative policy framework in which a carbon tax is levied globally while adaptation is supported through the recycling of carbon tax revenue. The optimal level of adaptation aid is discussed. In contrast to a single carbon tax approach, it can address climate inequity issues directly by supporting adaptation programs of vulnerable poor regions. Moreover, this approach provides more incentives for developing countries to participate in global climate negotiations."

"February 06, 2010","Given the importance of the assertion or prevention of regional leadership for the future global order, this paper examines the strategies and resources being used to assert regional leadership as well as the reactions of other states within and outside the respective regions. Secondary powers play a key role in the regional acceptance of a leadership claim. In this article we identify the factors motivating secondary powers to accept or contest this claim. Three regional dyads, marked by different degrees of “contested leadership,” are analyzed: Brazil vs. Venezuela, India vs. Pakistan, and South Africa vs. Nigeria. The research outcomes demonstrate that the strategies of regional powers and the reactions of secondary powers result from the distribution of material capabilities and their application, the regional powers’ ability to project ideational resources, the respective national interests of regional and secondary powers, and the regional impact of external powers."
"February 06, 2010","The first comment argues that the current economic approach to EU state aid policy tends to become a general control of the effectiveness of all subsidies in the Member States. This goes far beyond the initial intention of the EU competition rules of Art. 87 to 89 EC Treaty. An economic approach that also takes into account the economic theory of federalism would lead to a sophisticated two-level system of state aid control in which (1) the EU state aid control is limited to state aid with spillover effects on other Member States and (2) national agencies for controlling subsidies focus on subsidies with their primary effects within the Member States. The second comment suggests the possibility of using EU merger policy to prevent firms from becoming ‘too big to fail’. This would reduce the danger of bailouts that can lead to significant distortions of competition. The possibility of a bailout test in merger policy is discussed."
"February 06, 2010","It is argued that instead of imposing on each country internationally agreed quotas on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions, it would be easier to implement, enforce and verify, if each country mandates the installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for each significant industrial category. It is BACT that has to be agreed on by an international convention, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A possible BACT for coal-fueled power plants is the Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) cum Carbon Capture and Sequestration. For transportation vehicles, there is no “add-on” technology that can capture CO2 emissions. Here CO2 emissions must be limited by increased fuel mileage. There should be an internationally agreed maximum vehicle weight for passenger cars, which the author suggests to be 1000 kg. Because BACT can be implemented only on new sources, there must be an anti-grandfathering rule, e.g. all existing coal-fired power plants must be retired after their 35th year operating time; all personal vehicles must be scrapped after their 10th year on the road."
"February 06, 2010","The concept of hegemonic overreach proposes a revision of Kennedy’s notion of imperial overstretch that puts more emphasis on policy choices of hegemonic states.  Previous long-cycle theories of hegemonic breakdown have focused on the contradiction between the hegemon’s growing military-political commitments and its slipping economic capability relative to rising challenger states.  Another key contradiction in U.S. foreign policy is between the imperatives of hegemony and the ideology of messianic mission developed long before the U.S. stepped up to its current global role.  Hegemonic overreach, driven by this sense of messianic mission, is a major cause of failure in U.S. foreign policy."

"February 06, 2010","This paper argues that where institutions are strong, actors are more likely to participate in the political process through institutionalized arenas, while where they are weak, protests and other unconventional means of participation become more appealing. This relationship is explored empirically by combining country-level measures of institutional strength with individual-level information on protest participation in 17 Latin American countries. Evidence is found that weaker political institutions are associated with a higher propensity to use alternative means for expressing preferences, that is, to protest. Also found are interesting interactions between country-level institutional strength and some individual-level determinants of participation in protests."
"February 06, 2010","While economists have tended to focus on specific public policies when developing recommendations, the achievement of welfare objectives might depend more on the quality of policies than their content. This paper develops several measures of the qualities of policies across countries, arguing that the quality of public policies depends on each polity’s ability to strike intertemporal transactions necessary to develop and sustain effective policies. The analytical framework developed here indicates that this ability depends on several characteristics of political institutions, such as congressional capabilities, judicial independence, and bureaucratic independence and professionalism. The empirical evidence presented supports this idea. The measures of policy quality developed here could be utilized for other purposes, including the determination of conditions under which more public spending in a given area is likely to generate the desired outcomes."

What this means is that, if no major breakthrough in science takes place, a threat will also be posed to sustainable development itself, in-as-much as that this entails such a means of proceeding with development as ”meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future to meet its own needs”."
"February 06, 2010","This paper develops a framework for analyzing different policymaking styles, their causes and their consequences in Latin America, finding that lower institutionalization and greater use of alternative political technologies (APTs) are more likely the lower the cost of using these technologies, the higher the potential damage they can cause, the lower the wealth of the economy, and the more asymmetric the distribution of de jure political power. Moreover, strategic complementarity exists in the use of alternative political technologies; for instance ""bribes by the rich"" and ""protests by the poor"" are likely to be countervailing forces, and will both occur in polities with weaker political institutions."

"February 06, 2010","Veto player theory argues that a higher number of veto players lowers the likelihood of change; in turn, policies that do not change help to sustain commitments but may prevent adaptation to changing circumstances. This paper challenges that claim of veto player theory by arguing that policy stability does not necessarily mean lower policy adaptability. If policymaking takes place over time with actors interacting repeatedly, more cooperative polities might be able to achieve both objectives at once, and a higher number of veto players might even favor intertemporal cooperation. The paper presents a simple formalization of the argument and some supportive cross-national empirical evidence."
"February 05, 2010","In the teaching of political ideas, Model United Nations (MUN) simulations in the classroom have been valued as a method to experience the democratic process. But, several studies have also noted that the extent of the experience is limited and often unrealistic, if not a distraction. This paper presents the results from an observational study whereby a MUN program in the Russian Far East served as the quasi-treatment effect. Members of an existing MUN program were surveyed for their political beliefs and attitudes to be compared to two other groups: one group who only attended an informational meeting about MUN and a second randomly selected group with no exposure to MUN. All three were given identical surveys. The initial results demonstrate a profound treatment effect. Unlike the control group who varied greatly in beliefs and attitudes about democracy in Russia, the MUN students seem to be less extreme in opinions and generally more satisfied with democracy in Russia. The salient implication taken from this study is that the ideals of democracy are internalized effectively when its principles are learned, practiced, and then shared from the bottom up."

Estimation of biodiversity can be carried out on various levels of organisation of nature. The majority of currently used indicators are linked to species and eco-system (landscape) diversity. It has been established that indicators concerning the state of the natural environ-ment are of great importance for evaluation of fulfilment of the assumptions of sustainable development, for which the important goal should be the restriction of the rate of species extinction on Earth."
"February 05, 2010","The last four years into the 2000 new millennium ushered in a new era disbelief, discontent and despair in the eyes on one hand, of Zimbabwean state as an actor in the international system and on the other hand of the international community. Some international actors chose (besides other forms altering the behavior i.e military force, political coercion, covert action and diplomatic persuasion) to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe citing misdeeds that the country was committing. Sanctions as such were targeted at altering the behavior of Zimbabwe as an actor in international relations to more desirable state of affairs from the point of view of the imposers. It is the purpose of this paper to analyse the justifications and implementation of sanctions as a tool of altering behavior of international actors. The paper holds that though the sanctions had a considerable impact on Zimbabwe, the intended objectives were not achieved. The paper seeks in the final analysis  to investigate the factors that contributed to their failure from both the imposer and the target."
"February 05, 2010","Whether foreigner or citizen, as whether innocent or guilty, we are all worthy of being accorded justice when our fundamental rights are at stake. Working with international law and, where available, constitutional guarantees, tribunals in Canada and elsewhere will have to continue to push for the ultimate pre-eminence of human rights and freedoms over the interests of the State, especially in troubled times such as these. The protection of Canada, of its sovereignty, of its borders, cannot legitimately be based on the negation of the rights and freedoms of foreigners: ultimately, they are not different from the rights and freedoms of the citizen. It took us a long time to understand that fighting organized crime could not legitimately be achieved at the cost of the rights of the accused and many a criminal has been set free because of obscure procedural errors. Fighting terrorism is an essential social, political and legal objective, but not at any cost. Certainly it should not be pursued at the cost of anyone's fundamental rights and freedoms, as these are the benchmarks of a civilization based on the pre-eminence of human dignity."
"February 05, 2010","We analyse the optimal level of political decision making, national or regional. The benefit of policy making at the regional level is that it allows for policy differentiation, which serves the interests of regional majorities. The argument in favor of a national policy is that it may generate a more moderate policy, which protects the interests of regional minorities. Our paper analyses how the degree of geographical segregation and the degree of polarization of preferences affect the trade-off between these two concerns."

"February 05, 2010","This paper explores the new politics of difference in Argentina since the 1994 constitutional reform, and its ramifications for citizenship and indigenous wellbeing. Through a comparison of land struggles among the Mbya Guaraní in Misiones and the Diaguita Calchaquí in Tucumán it is shown that new collective rights only gained traction once indigenous social movements employed the language of ‘differentiated rights’ and pushed for the implementation of multicultural legislation. At the same time, local indigenous communities continue to face adverse socioeconomic incorporation, and the new legal frameworks focus on land rights, thereby foreclosing the establishment of indigenous control over territory. The current politics of recognition in Argentina thus plays a crucial role in deepening cultural and political citizenship, while its impacts remain limited for addressing broader issues of social justice."
"February 03, 2010","This paper exploits data on the pattern of violence across regions and over time to  estimate the impact of the peace process in Northern Ireland on house prices. We  begin with a linear model that estimates the average treatment effect of a conflictrelated  killing on house prices - showing a negative correlation between house prices  and killings. We then develop an approach based on an economic model where the  parameters of the statistical process are estimated for a Markov switching model  where conflict and peace are treated as a latent state. From this, we are able to  construct a measure of the discounted number of killings which is updated in the  light of actual killings. This model naturally suggests a heterogeneous effect of  killings across space and time which we use to generate estimates of the peace  dividend. The economic model suggests a somewhat different pattern of estimates to  the linear model. We also show that there is some evidence of spillover effects of  violence in adjacent regions."
"February 03, 2010","Rights-based approaches to development promise to deliver many development goals, particularly in terms of creating a political environment conducive to development. As citizens become empowered through rights-based approaches to make increased demands on the state, it is envisaged that good, more accountable governance will emerge, as states fulfill their obligations to citizens. It is not clear, however, that the promotion of rights-based approaches by NGOs is likely to achieve this. Although processes of state and citizenship formation are critical for development, the sequencing of such processes and their outcomes, and the patterns of causality between them, remain historically and contextually specific. This paper reveals both the potential and the problems that arise when certain rights-based approaches engage with the politics of promoting progressive social change. It explores this challenge of transformation through a case study of a participatory rights-based programme that seeks to assist a marginal pastoral group in North West Cameroon to be empowered citizens. The programme has been relatively successful in catalysing underlying processes of sociopolitical and has improved the quality of local governance. However, the programme’s explicit, often confrontational engagement with the power relations underpinning exclusion and exploitation has been both a strength and a liability in advancing progressive social change. This raises critical challenges for the strategic, theoretical and philosophical dimensions of rights-based approaches."
"February 03, 2010","Questions and concerns regarding nuclear proliferation have engaged security scholars for decades. Why do some states proliferate, while others decide not to? What roles do international institutions, norms, and the balancing of power play in such decisions? These questions and many others address proliferation from the demand-side. In this paper, we approach proliferation from the opposite angle - the supply-side. Why do nuclear states decide to help non-nuclear states proliferate? Why do these supplier states decide to help these particular recipient states, and not any others? As opposed to focusing exclusively on supplier states, we part from recent research to propose a bargaining theory of nuclear supply, where relational factors, domestic players, critical bargaining chips, and international conditions interact to explain the success or failure of the nuclear collaboration."
"February 03, 2010","Six sub-Saharan African countries currently have laws on sexual violence, including Kenya, and eight others have provisions on sexual violence in other legislation. Effective legislation requires functioning medico-legal linkages to enable both justice to be done in cases of sexual violence and the provision of health services for survivors of sexual violence. The health sector also needs to provide post-rape care services and collect and deliver evidence to the criminal justice system. This paper reviews existing data on sexual violence in sub-Saharan Africa, and summarises the content of sexual violence legislation in the region and the strengths and weaknesses of existing medico-legal linkages, using Kenya as a case study. Many sub-Saharan African countries do not yet have comprehensive post-rape care services, nor substantial co-ordination between HIV and sexual and reproductive health services, the legal and judicial systems, and sexual violence legislation. These need to be integrated by cross-referrals, using standardised referral guidelines and pathways, treatment protocols, and medico-legal procedures. Common training approaches and harmonised information across sectors, and common indicators, would facilitate government accountability. Joint and collaborative planning and working at country level, through sharing of information and data between the different systems remain key to achieving this."
"February 03, 2010","One of the most striking institutional features of many less developed countries is that their militaries are closely involved in policy-making, potentially having a large impact on economic outcomes. This paper examines the role of the military in setting policy. For this purpose it develops one of the first models of the military, where its political involvement can take two forms: direct when the military runs the government, and indirect when it influences policy without governing directly. We focus on civilian regimes and find that war decreases the payoff to the military from both forms of involvement, but also makes staging successful coups easier. In equilibrium, an increase in the likelihood of war makes indirect involvement less likely; its impact on coups, which are aimed at establishing direct control, is non-monotonic. We show empirical evidence for this non-monotonic relationship, with  coups being least likely for low and high probabilities of war."
"February 03, 2010","We report on an on-going project, which asks a number of questions relevant to the  study of state capacity. What are the main economic and political determinants of  the state's capacity to raise revenue and support private markets? How do risks of  violent conflict affect the incentives to invest in state building? Does it matter  whether conflicts are external or internal to the state? When are large states  associated with higher income levels and growth rates than small states? What  relations should we expect between resource rents, civil wars and economic  development? The paper is organized into three main sections: 1. The origins of state  capacity, 2. State capacity and the genius of taxation, and 3. State capacity and the  strategy of conflict. Each of these begins with a specific motivation. A simple model  is formulated to analyze the determinants of state capacity in the first section, and  modified to address the new issues that arise in subsequent sections. The theoretical  results are summarized in a number of propositions. We discuss the implications of  the theory, comment on its relation to existing literature, and briefly mention some  empiric applications."
"February 03, 2010","This paper studies the incidence of civil war over time. We put forward a canonical model of civil war, which relates the incidence of conflict to circumstances, institutions and features of the underlying economy and polity. We use this model to derive testable predictions and to interpret the cross-sectional and times-series variations in civil conflict. Our most novel empirical finding is that higher world market prices of exported, as well as imported, commodities are strong and significant predictors of higher within-country incidence of civil war."
"February 03, 2010","Female genital mutilation (FGM) has long been practised in many communities in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Although the Ghanaian state has a long tradition of supporting women's rights, it has not been successful in eradicating FGM, despite a law against the practice in an amendment to the Criminal Code in 1994 and the Domestic Violence Act 2003. This qualitative study in the Upper East Region examined the role of the state in stopping the practice of FGM through legal means, and why FGM continues to be practised in the community. In-depth interviews were conducted with six state officials, a circumciser, the president of a women's advocacy organisation, and semi-structured interviews with 32 community members. Although FGM has been criminalised, political support to ensure that the law is effectively implemented has been lacking. FGM education and eradication must be given more priority and significant funding by the Ghanaian state. For interventions to be effective, legal measures need to be combined with social measures. Communities practising FGM must be involved in the planning and implementation of anti-FGM interventions. Successful eradication of the practice is possible if education and dialogue between state institutions, gender and human rights groups and practicing communities is strengthened."

As the evidence collected in the paper shows, inequality and exclusion impose severe costs on poverty reduction, growth, and social and political progress, ultimately detaining any effort to build social cohesion, and thus, should be a high priority for citizens, governments and the international community."
"February 02, 2010","We develop indicators to measure the degree of economic integration and cooperation among East Asian economies and compare these with similar measures for other regions. Our indicators cover regional integration in trade, investment, financial assets, and people-to-people exchange. We also analyze measures of regional cooperation such as the density of free trade agreements and official policy dialogues. We find that in various Asian groupings, and especially in a group of 16 integrating Asian economies, interdependence in trade, direct investment, financial flows, and other forms of economic and social exchange has increased significantly over time, and now approaches that in the European Union. Nonetheless, Asia’s official cooperation remains weak and formal regional institutions remain relatively underdeveloped. To provide insight into the causes of this discrepancy, we also develop quantitative measures of political and cultural similarity of nations, and find that Asian countries have relatively low levels of political and cultural proximity compared to regions such as Europe. The diversity of political interests and cultural values may have hindered more intense cooperation among Asian economies in the past. But if regional economic and social interactions continue to grow, requirements for joint decision-making are also likely to expand, leading to stronger frameworks of official cooperation."
"February 01, 2010","Traditional pedagogical techniques – lectures, readings, and discussion of historical case studies – often lead students to conclude that history is predetermined by processes over which individuals have little control. These teaching methods also force students to passively receive information before they get the opportunity to apply it – a delay that probably diminishes the information’s relevance to students when they attempt to understand the causes of international conflict."
"February 01, 2010","The global economic crisis refocused attention on the governance of international economic institutions (IEIs). This study uses the analytical framework of club theory to highlight structural obstacles to reform in international macroeconomic management, development finance, trade, and financial stability. The authors argue that reforms currently being discussed - for example, in voting power in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - are important, but not sufficient to make IEIs adaptable to the demands of a rapidly changing world economy. The authors propose transforming IEIs by shifting more decisions from the global to sub-global level. Partially decentralized decision making already exists in some policy areas (for example in regional development banks) and could expand and improve the provision of international public goods."
"February 01, 2010","We posit that sound, growth-promoting economic policy is more likely to be formulated when major political players have incentives to cooperate. Using Portugal as an arena to test this theory, we provide an in depth analysis of its policymaking environment, finding that Portuguese institutional arrangements are what we term “dry.” That is, they are not well suited to provide incentives for cooperation among actors in the policymaking process. Portugal has had difficulty sustaining economic growth in the long term. Our arguments are supported with both contextual analyses and a statistical examination, in which we find a strong link between single-party majority government and positive economic and fiscal performance. These findings have broad implications for democratic economies across the world."
"February 01, 2010","Since the Great Depression in 1929, economists have never stopped soul-searching for the lessons to be drawn from the crisis. But mainstream reflections have been misguided, confined to stereotypical targets of blame such as “lax regulation,” “policy mistakes” and “underestimation of risks.” Regretfully, understanding of the root cause of the current sub-prime crisis is as superficial as before. The reasons for both crises seem to be polar opposites: The Great Depression of 1929 was triggered by insufficient effective demand, while the ongoing sub-prime mortgage crisis was triggered by “excess” effective demand. In fact, however, the classic crisis and the modern crisis in the capitalist world essentially originate from the same thing: Crisis of overproduction. The shift from classic crisis into modern crisis only kicks the ball from supply side to demand side. Given the intrinsic contradictions of the market economy that give rise to the crisis, the analytical framework of “risk and regulation” proves difficult to help us understand its nature. For this reason, we must turn to a Marxist questioning of the crisis."
"February 01, 2010","Despite the major advances in information technology that have shaped the recent wave of globalization, openness to trade is still a political choice, and trade policy can change with shifts in domestic political equilibria. This paper suggests that a particular threat and a limiting factor to globalization and its future developments may be militarist sentiments that appear to be on the rise among many nations around the globe today. We proxy militarism by spending on the military and the size of the military, and document that over the past 20 years, countries experiencing greater increases in militarism according to these measures have had lower growth in trade. Focusing on bilateral trade flows, we also show that controlling flexibly for country trends, a pair of countries jointly experiencing greater increases in militarism has lower growth in bilateral trade."
"January 30, 2010","Typically, inter-religious conflict posed the main threat to racial and religious harmony in Singapore. In 2009, ‘soft constitutional law’ norms ordering the distinct but overlapping spheres of ‘religion’ and 'politics' were extended to a newly emergent public order threat to social harmony. This arises where groups advocating religiously informed values clash with groups advocating liberalhumanistic values to shape legal policy. The ‘AWARE controversy’ exemplified such ‘culture wars’. A non-government organisation leadership tussle became a public order threat when non-religious parties invoked the spectre of religious activism to agitate other religious and secular groups; this episode received presidential and ministerial attention in major policy speeches, reiterating the rules of engagement between religion and politics in a secular democracy. These informal norms are analysed to ascertain the legitimate role of religion in the public sphere as exercises of religious liberty, and what constitutes a religious ‘threat’ to public order within the constitutional framework."
"January 29, 2010","On July 1, 2001, a nationwide law in Portugal took effect that decriminalized all drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Under the new legal framework, all drugs were ""decriminalized,"" not ""legalized."" Thus, drug possession for personal use and drug usage itself are still legally prohibited, but violations of those prohibitions are deemed to be exclusively administrative violations and are removed completely from the criminal realm. Drug trafficking continues to be prosecuted as a criminal offense."
"January 29, 2010","Given the nature of the conflict in Afghanistan, a definitive, conventional ""victory"" is not a realistic option. Denying a sanctuary to terrorists who seek to attack the United States does not require Washington to pacify the entire country, eradicate its opium fields, or sustain a long-term military presence in Central Asia. From the sky, U.S. unmanned aerial vehicles can monitor villages, training camps, and insurgent compounds. On the ground, the United States can retain a small number of covert operatives for intelligence gathering and discrete operations against specific targets, as well as an additional small group of advisers to train Afghan police and military forces. The United States should withdraw most of its forces from Afghanistan within the next 12 to 18 months and treat al Qaeda's presence in the region as a chronic, but manageable, problem."

"January 29, 2010","The possibility of using private military and security companies to bolster the capacity to undertake humanitarian intervention has been increasingly debated. The focus of such discussions has, however, largely been on practical issues and the contingent problems posed by private force. By contrast, this paper considers the principled case for privatising humanitarian intervention. It focuses on two central issues. First, is there a case for preferring these firms to other, state-based agents of humanitarian intervention? In particular, given a state’s duties to their own military personnel, should the use of private military and security contractors be preferred to regular soldiers for humanitarian intervention? Second, on the other hand, does outsourcing humanitarian intervention to private military and security companies pose some fundamental, deeper problems in this context, such as an abdication of a state’s duties?"
"January 28, 2010","Over the past 15 years the international community has committed to advocate in favor of the rights of the children and against the phenomenon of child recruitment. All their efforts are now materialized in conventions, protocols and principles for the protection of children and the prosecution of child recruitment as a war crime. In Colombia, thousands of boys and girls are victims of illegal recruitment. The vulnerability that children face on a daily basis and the prevalent impunity of the recruiters. The fact that the international community is watching the developments closely in the fight against child recruitment, places Colombia in a position where it needs to decide whether to continue to expose itself to the legal consequences of ignoring the rights of its children, or to start to comply with its national and international responsibilities with regards to child protection and accountability."
"January 28, 2010","This article describes strategic alternatives to the United States (US) ‘war on terror’ and consequences of past policies. It is argued that the ‘war on terror’ metaphor has failed and that strategic incoherence and tactical errors have mired the US in a series of failing land wars in Southwest Asia. The article proposes the adoption of a containment policy and recasting the ‘war on terror’ into a criminal law framework."
"January 27, 2010","This essay argues that knowledge culture today is integral to the global archivization of human rights violations. Taking as its subject of analysis the website Witness, it argues that new forms of narratives emerge on a daily basis from across the world, constituting a new knowledge form about the world, that websites like Witness constitute a non-official and user-generated archive of testimony that demands an ethical engagement. The database, it argues, is a central ‘genre’ of human rights discourse in the new knowledge economy. A ‘narrative’ emerges from the database through a collection of trajectories used/followed by the reader. I suggest that this matter of user-choice is a call for an ethical engagement with the database of the suffering Others. It creates a new geography - of suffering - for us to explore. Witness is the space where the suffering Other appears, and calls upon us to respond ethically."
"January 27, 2010","The Goldstone Report, when read in full and in context, is much worse than most of its detractors (and supporters) believe. It is far more accusatory of Israel, far less balanced in its criticism of Hamas, far less honest in its evaluation of the evidence, far less responsible in drawing its conclusion, far more biased against Israeli than Palestinian witnesses, and far more willing to draw adverse inferences of intentionality from Israeli conduct and statements than from comparable Palestinian conduct and statements. It is worse than any report previously prepared by any other United Nations agency or human rights group. As Major General Avichai Mandelblit, the advocate general of the Israeli Defense Forces, aptly put it: “I have read every report, from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Arab League. We ourselves set up investigations into 140 complaints. It is when you read these other reports and complaints that you realize how truly vicious the Goldstone report is. He made it look like we set out to go after the economic infrastructure and civilians, that it was intentional: It’s a vicious lie."
"January 27, 2010","The idea of co-application of international humanitarian law and human rights law has drawn a tremendous amount of academic attention and a huge amount of innovation in international and domestic jurisprudence. Yet in the current headlong approach into convergence, rights and rights institutions may carry risks to the very goals many humanitarian-minded international lawyers seek to achieve. This article takes a bird’s-eye view of the debate and questions whether it is a good thing to insist on the extraterritorial applicability of human rights to armed conflict situations. In doing so, the article argues that parallel application is equally as bad for the Iraqi civilian as it is for the American soldier. As we pull back the layers of legalistic argumentation, the real role of rights discourse and the real function of human rights law on the battlefield seem much less thought-out than leading scholars suggest, and the implications for this new approach to international law seem much more problematic than the current debate on the issue presents."
"January 26, 2010","According to standard neoclassical theory, institutions do not matter for understanding the process of economic change or why economies operate inefficiently because institutions will evolve to enhance economic efficiency. In contrast, a behavioral approach lets institutions have a substantive impact on the economy because institutions determine the incentive structure within which economic agents make their choice, critically, the bargaining power of labor. It has been argued that efficiency-inducing institutions require private property rights that bring the private rate of return in line with the social rate of return. However this paper argues that this alone will not bring about efficiency and that efficient institutional change is dependent on allowing labor to increase its bargaining power. When bargaining power has been suppressed (such as in serfdom) only a small group yield benefits generating inefficient results. However enhancing the bargaining power of labor and then letting firms respond to higher labor costs, will promote efficiency and technological progress. Labor rights are also required for an economy to move towards its outer-most production possibility frontier. Labor rights can therefore be viewed as a component of a human rights bundle critical to democratic governance."
"January 26, 2010","Does foreign military assistance strengthen or further weaken fragile states facing internal conflict? We address this question by estimating how U.S. military aid affects violence and electoral participation in Colombia. We exploit the allocation of U.S. military aid to Colombian military bases, and compare how aid affects municipalities with and without bases. Using detailed political violence data, we find that U.S. military aid leads to differential increases in attacks by paramilitaries (who collude with the military), but has no effect on guerilla attacks. Aid increases also result in more paramilitary (but not guerrilla) homicides during election years. Moreover, when military aid rises, voter turnout falls more in base municipalities, especially those that are politically contested."
"January 26, 2010","Deference and dissent strike a delicate balance in any polity. Insufficient deference to authority may incapacitate government, whereas too much may allow leaders to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national and cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and willingness to express dissent has long been studied in political science, rarely have scholars studied programs designed to change these aspects of political culture. This study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda, reports a qualitative and quantitative assessment of one such attempt, a radio program aimed at discouraging blind obedience and reliance on direction from authorities and promoting independent thought and collective action in problem solving. Over the course of one year, this radio program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was randomly presented to pairs of communities, including communities of genocide survivors, Twa people, and imprisoned génocidaires. Changes in individual attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative behaviors were assessed using closed-ended interviews, focus group discussions, role-play exercises, and unobtrusive measures of collective decision making. Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on listeners' willingness to express dissent and the ways they resolved communal problems."
"January 26, 2010","This paper builds an analytical framework that models predation (banditry) and production as part of the choice of a rational utility-maximising agent. Aggregating this choice up for society produces equilibrium outcomes ranging from Utopia (where no one predates) to Amorphy (where everyone does). The intermediate position constitutes Anarchy where a mix of predation and production prevail. This framework shows that (i) organized conflict can lower welfare relative to the level that prevails without such organization; and, (ii) peacekeeping raises welfare, but the equilibrium is self-enforcing only with the requisite level of peacekeeping technology. The last is then used to analyse conditions under which peacekeeping arises endogenously and the potential (and catalytic) role for external assistance in the above."
"January 26, 2010","The last two centuries have seen the rise of the nation-state as the dominant political institution around the world. However, “state” and “nation” are not always equivalent.  In a surprising number of countries, autonomist and secessionist movements of varying strength and character remain active.  The question we consider in this paper is whether decentralization is likely to hurt or help national unity in these “countries at risk.”  After reviewing some of the relevant literature, we turn to the scanty empirical evidence supporting any view of this complex question, looking first at the very mixed stories of linkages between decentralization and national unity that emerge in a wide variety of countries around the world and then a bit more closely at the available time-series evidence in four OECD countries – Belgium, Spain, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The main conclusion that emerges from this review is essentially that as yet no one has   either generally persuasive ideas or evidence about the impact of decentralization on national unity. In view of the complexity and context-sensitivity of the issue, this negative outcome is not surprising.  In principle, decentralization may sometimes be a way station for a region on its way out of a country and in others an inducement for regions to stay rather than to leave.  The impact of decentralization appears to depend not only upon the details of what is done but also the specific context and time when it is done, as well as at whose initiative."
"January 26, 2010","Since its secession from Somalia in 1991, the east-African nation of Somaliland has become one of the most democratic governments in eastern Africa. Yet Somaliland has never been recognized by the international community. This paper examines how this lack of recognition - and the consequent ineligibility for foreign financial assistance - has shaped Somaliland’s political development. It finds evidence that Somaliland’s ineligibility for foreign aid facilitated the development of accountable political institutions and contributed to the willingness of Somalilanders to engage constructively in the state-building process."
"January 26, 2010","This paper treats terrorism as an economic phenomenon - as a way to understand it and to control it. It uses the tools of substitution, innovation, and cycles and concludes by noting the importance of intelligence and that the most valuable approach to defeating terrorism is that of denying resources to the terrorists rather than attempting to protect assets at risk. It notes that we are probably not any safer than before the implementation of the post–9/11 strategies and emphasizes that new initiatives must be undertaken to prevent terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction."
"January 25, 2010","This article analyzes contemporary Eritrea’s acute crisis within the framework of the theory of anomie. It is based on the hypothesis that militarization, forced labor, mass exodus, and family disintegration can be interpreted as the consequences of two incompatible norm and value systems: the collectivist, nationalistic, and militaristic worldview of the former liberation front and ruling party People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), and the traditional cultural system of Eritrea’s society. In 2002 the regime introduced an unlimited “development campaign,” thereby forcing large parts of the society to live as conscripts and perform unpaid labor. This has caused a mass exodus of young people and a rapid process of family disintegration. The article is based on empirical fieldwork and evaluates the ongoing developments, which have led to rapid economic decline and the destabilization of the entire fabric of society."
"January 25, 2010","Elinor Ostrom, the 2009 Nobel Prize winner in economic science, has made significant contributions throughout her career to the disciplines of political economy and public choice. Her most widely recognized contributions relate to the work on common-pool resources. She has discovered a diversity of institutional arrangements that serve in various human societies to promote cooperation and avoid conflict over resource use. Where a strict interpretation of theory would predict over-use and mismanagement, she found collective action arrangements that proved effective in limiting access and establishing accountability. Many of the effective tools of governance she found resided not in the formal structure of government, but instead in the informal, and sometimes even tacit, rules that communities live by."
"January 25, 2010","This paper studies the oil‐violence link in the Niger Delta, systematically taking into consideration domestic and international contextual factors. The case study, which focuses on explaining the increase in violence since the second half of the 1990s, confirms the differentiated interplay of resource‐specific and non‐resource‐specific causal factors. With regard to the key contextual conditions responsible for violence, the results underline the basic relevance of cultural cleavages and political‐institutional and socioeconomic weakness that existed even before the beginning of the “oil era.” Oil has indirectly boosted the risk of violent conflicts through a further distortion of the national economy. Moreover, the transition to democratic rule in 1999 decisively increased the opportunities for violent struggle, in a twofold manner: firstly, through the easing of political repression and, secondly, through the spread of armed youth groups, which have been fostered by corrupt politicians. These incidents imply that violence in the Niger Delta is increasingly driven by the autonomous dynamics of an economy of violence: The involvement of security forces, politicians and (international) businessmen in illegal oil theft helps to explain the perpetuation of the violent conflicts at a low level of intensity."
"January 25, 2010","The Treaty of Lisbon will work a sea-change in the operations of the European Union.

"January 21, 2010","I argue that international politics – and globalization in particular – must be understood by tracing their historical development.  Many of the present phenomena of ‘globalization’ have their roots in the expansion of the European state system.  Consequently, I undertake a structured, comparative case study analysis of the Northwest coast of America and examine how it was absorbed into the expanding European-centered state system.  I trace the process of incorporation, and develop a refined model of incorporation, including the development of a ‘zone of ignorance’ beyond the ‘known’ world which serves as an enabling mechanism for actors promoting incorporating behavior (i.e., exploration, colonization, conquest).  In addition to textual analysis, I also use historically contemporary maps to ‘operationalize’ the stages of systemic expansion.  This allows cross-temporal comparison of event-contexts with regard to the incorporation process, without having to ‘anchor’ the timeframe across cases; one can focus on process rather than era.  I argue that significant socio-cultural, political, and economic change occurs upon contact between civilizations, and that these early changes have been largely overlooked in current international relations and ‘modern’ globalization literature. Quite simply, the rules of the game and the agenda for negotiations are solidified rather early, well before most scholars examine the processes associated with globalization."
"January 19, 2010","Fearon and Laitin’s 2003 American Political Science Review paper had the surprising conclusion that ethnic heterogeneity had no significant effect upon either ethnic or civil war.

This paper uses a different statistical technique from theirs to show that ethnic heterogeneity can, indeed, have significant and positive effects on ethnic war, especially when models account for Africa."
"January 19, 2010","The paper deals with preventive detention in the United States, i.e. the detaining of a suspect to prevent a future domestic terrorist offense. Two recent events are examined: the Fort Hood shootings; and a preventive arrest in France, to consider problems in combating terrorist crimes on U.S. soil. The paper demonstrates that U.S. law as it now stands, with some limited exceptions, does not permit detention to forestall an anticipated domestic terrorist crime. After reviewing and evaluating the way in which France, Israel and the United Kingdom use forms of preventive detention to thwart possible terrorist acts, the paper proposes three possible ways to fill this gap in U.S. law, and give the United States the same tools to fight terrorism as the other countries discussed in the paper, within the boundaries of the Constitution."
"January 19, 2010","This article argues that regional security cooperation in Southeast Asia, mainly promoted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), is a response to China's economic rise. Although China is not regarded as a military challenge, Beijing’s ascension threatens to undermine the regional balance of power. The emerging insecurities threaten the stability of the regimes whose power is based on output legitimacy. Cooperation, the thesis states, can reduce these uncertainties. Yet, whereas collaboration in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) offers Beijing incentives for the strengthening of its “enlightened” multilateralism, regional cooperation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) will not change China’s behaviour. The reason is that this cooperation is based on Realpolitik motives. Offensive Realism seems therefore well suited to analyse the Central Asian power relations."
"January 18, 2010","For five years (1994-1999), I directly negotiated ‘on the ground’ implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process in the Gaza Strip.

The article which addressees fundamental differences between agreement ‘architects’ and agreement ‘implementers’ is intended to facilitate future negotiations and implementations alike. Based on a ‘bird’s eye’ view I  suggest ten core ‘lessons learned’ relevant to negotiating including cultural, linguistic, tactical, strategic and operational considerations."
"January 18, 2010","Over a long time, Tajikistan remains as a transit hub for Afghan drugs to the markets in the different parts of Asia and Europe. Till today, after more than one and half decades of independence, 1344 long porous Tajik-Afghan border is the easiest border to cross for the drug smugglers. Specific geographical location and social condition of Tajikistan in general and its insecure border with Afghanistan in particular make it more vulnerable to become transit route for Afghan drugs.  Magnitudes of threats posed by drugs trafficking to the Tajik society and outside world are immense.  To curtail the destabilizing effects of uncontrolled flow of narcotics through the Tajik-Afghan border, active multilateral effort should be made as drugs trafficking in Tajikistan is very much related to the global security."
"January 17, 2010","In many instances of potential violent or non-violent conflict the future strategic positions of adversaries are very different when there is open conflict than when there is settlement. In such environments we show that, as the future becomes more important, open conflict becomes more likely than settlement. We demonstrate the theoretical robustness of this finding, discuss its applicability in war, litigation, and other settings, and test it in a laboratory experiment. We find that subjects are more likely to engage in risky conflict as the future becomes more important."
"January 15, 2010","Mediation is mostly treated apart from other approaches to dealing with violent conflicts, especially when dealing with conflict in which one or both parties deny the legitimacy of an overarching sovereign authority. This is the case in most violent conflicts in Southeast Asia which are overwhelmingly ethnic in nature and usually pit a group fighting against the central government. This paper treats mediation as just one tool in a wider set of approaches to dealing with so called ""intractable-conflicts"" and shows how mediation can and should be integrated so as to achieve the synergy and momentum necessary to deal with the many obstacles to a long term settlement of a dispute. The concepts of Human Security as well as of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) are sued as overarching theoretical frameworks necessary in order to achieve not only negative but also positive peace. An approach to mediation resembling Lederach's ""elicitive model"" and Burton's problem solving workshops are recommended as important tools in a concerted and holistic effort to move an intractable conflict towards settlement and sustainable peace. Examples are used throughout the paper from Southeast Asia's many intractable conflicts such as the one in Indonesia between the government and the Pan-Islamic movement Jemaah Islamiya (JI), the Muslim nationalist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) fighting for idependence in the Philippines, and the Southern Muslim insurgency in Thailand fighting for an Independent Greater Patani"
"January 15, 2010","In a recent article, Gibler examines how previous alliance violations affect future alliance potential during a leader’s tenure among dyads (2008). Gibler shows reputation plays a role, however his models do not consider how power and democracy serve as mediating influences on the reputational effects of alliance violation. We argue his theoretical argument fails to address the effects of constraints on involuntary defection from security commitments. Involuntary defection arises from two different but endogenous sources: 1) a lack of tangible military resources and 2) a lack of sufficient domestic support among the principal veto players to fulfill the commitment. Rationalists argue the effects involuntary defection on reputation should be treated differently when considering future cooperation (Chayes & Chayes 1995; Langlois & Langlois 2004). Our interest is in how state reputations, as opposed to leader reputations, are affected by alliance violation with respect to future alliance formation when states violate alliances due to constraints. Thus, we pose the following question: What effects do democracy, military capacity, and previous alliance violation have on future alliance potential for states? Though a crisp set analysis (Ragin 1989, 2000), we examine the effects of reputation, power, and democracy on future alliance commitments on a sample of 60 states in the modern era."
"January 15, 2010","This article examines the puzzle of how international organizations adopt new norms, by examining the case study of the UN Security Council.  Since 2000, the UN Security Council has increasingly adopted broad-based, non-coercive human rights related thematic resolutions, which I call TIPS resolutions (resolutions pertaining to thematic issues of peace and security).  While existing constructivist and realist IR theories account for how IOs’ promote and diffuse norms, the sources of international organizations’ norms still remain obscure. This Article aims to fill a gap in the existing literature by providing an account of the sources of norms promoted by an IO at the international level. It also highlights the potential impacts of non-coercive norm promotion by the Security Council. The article contends that the Security Council “consumes” norms from transnational advocacy networks, epistemic communities and through acculturation processes within the UN system.  The Security Council, like other IOs, also acts as a non-coercive diffuser and promoter of norms."
"January 14, 2010","Why do some civil wars terminate soon, with victory of one party over the other? What determines if the winner is the incumbent or the rebel group? Why do other conflicts last longer? We propose a simple model in which the power of each armed group depends on the number of combatants it is able to recruit. This is in turn a function of the relative 'distance' between group leaderships and potential recruits. We emphasize the moral hazard problem of recruitment: fighting is costly and risky so combatants have the incentive to defect from their task. They can also desert altogether and join the enemy. This incentive is stronger the farther away the fighter is from the principal, since monitoring becomes increasingly costly. Bigger armies have more power but less monitoring capacity to prevent defection and desertion. This general framework allows a variety of interpretations of what type of proximity matters for building strong cohesive armies ranging from ethnic distance to geographic dispersion. Different assumptions about the distribution of potential fighters along the relevant dimension of conflict lead to different equilibria. We characterize these, discuss the implied outcome in terms of who wins the war, and illustrate with historical and contemporaneous case studies."
"January 11, 2010","South America’s security agenda demands the simultaneous management of domestic crises, interstate conflicts and transnational threats. Though located at different systemic levels (national, international, transnational), the three conflict clusters are often interrelated and tend to overlap in the region’s border areas. The region’s policy makers, aware of this highly complex agenda and in spite of their striking differences, have tended to build regional structures of authority that coordinate, manage and rule collective responses to these threats. In addition, the unilateral, bilateral and multilateral structures and the region’s capabilities to solve conflicts have become more important than the respective inter-American bodies over the past decade. Given this shift in the management of regional security affairs, we ask if a multilevel approach on the part of an overarching security architecture is more effective than separate governance schemes regarding each specific security threat. Since neither the traditional models of power balancing and alliance building nor the security-community approach can sufficiently explain the region’s security dynamics, we assume and provide evidence that different systems of security governance overlap and coexist in South America."
"January 11, 2010","This paper examines whether terrorism is an effective tool to achieve political goals.  By exploiting variation in terror attacks over time and across locations in Israel from 1988 to 2006, we show that local terror attacks cause Israelis to be: (i) more willing to grant territorial concessions to the Palestinians; (ii) more willing to accept a Palestinian state; (iii) and less likely to identify oneself as being right-wing.  These effects are especially pronounced within demographic groups that are traditionally right-wing in their political views.  However, terror attacks beyond a certain threshold are less effective, and may reach levels which cause Israelis to adopt a less-accommodating position. In addition, we show that terror induces Israelis to vote increasingly for right-wing parties, as the right-wing parties move to the left in response to terror. Hence, terrorism appears to be an effective strategy in terms of shifting the entire Israeli political landscape to the left.  These findings may shed light on the causes underlying the spread of global terrorism in the last few decades."

Reports about security forces’ contribution to widespread insecurity are frequent: the protectors become violators and their appearance causes fear, not security."
"January 10, 2010","Although the European Union has been involved in Security Sector Reform (SSR) activities for a number of years, it has only recently developed policies and projects expressly dealing with this field. This article examines the logic of this latest EU trend and questions the approach and underlying agenda of the EU’s efforts in SSR."
"January 10, 2010","Despite a still low level of theorization of firm’s management, we have some proposals pointing in the direction of an effect of the Board composition on the performance. The Resource based view of the firm would explain this relationship by the social capital (networks) of Board’s members. This study examines the influence of social relationships of board of directors’ members on the performance of the firm using a sample of the 100 largest listed Canadian companies. Social relationships are measured by three factors: economic affiliations, political affiliations and social affiliations. The performance of the firm is measured by the return on assets. The results of regression analysis suggest that only the political affiliations of board of directors’ members have a significant although negative impact on the performance of the firm. These results suggest that separating business and politics might be a good idea as politics appear to be harmful to business."
"January 07, 2010","Terrorism in no longer confined to a territory or to a few isolated activities, rather it has surpassed all barriers and gained an international description. To check the menace and protect the innocent population various regional and global conventions have been ratified. However the roots of terrorism seems to be all the more penetrating into the heart of the civilization and is emerging to be the greatest threat to peaceful co-existence. The criminal record sharing model developed by the EU-US, principle of universal jurisdiction and the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction has in the recent past been thrown open for debates by policy makers. The international community is trying its level best to strike the chord of harmony between the various elements to maintain peace & prosperity. Perhaps it’s the blend of all the counter measures coupled with identification and prevention of causes that lead to terrorism, is the need of the hour."
"January 07, 2010","The use of courts to prosecute violations of human rights has grown exponentially since the 1990s. This growth has coincided with the vast accumulation of power by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the expansion of the concept of “universal jurisdiction.” NGOs claiming to promote human rights (many funded by European governments, the EU, and prominent foundations like the Ford Foundation and George Soros’ Open Society Institute) are engaged in international lobbying as well as filing civil lawsuits or initiating criminal complaints against Israeli officials for alleged “war crimes” or “crimes against humanity” in Belgium, England, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and elsewhere."
"January 06, 2010","Examining onsets of political instability in countries worldwide from 1955 to 2003, we develop a model that distinguishes countries that experienced instability from those that remained stable with a two-year lead time and over 80% accuracy. Intriguingly, the model uses few variables and a simple specification. The model is accurate in forecasting the onsets of both violent civil wars and nonviolent democratic reversals, suggesting common factors in both types of change. Whereas regime type is typically measured using linear or binary indicators of democracy/ autocracy derived from the 21-point Polity scale, the model uses a nonlinear five-category measure of regime type based on the Polity components. This new measure of regime type emerges as the most powerful predictor of instability onsets, leading us to conclude that political institutions,properly specified, and not economic conditions, demography, or geography, are the most important predictors of the onset of political instability."
"January 06, 2010","This is a review-essay of historian Paul Kennedy's recent history of the UN and global governance, The Parliament of Man.  It offers a critical look at Kennedy's account of the development of the UN as the gradual, if fitful, progress of the United Nations towards global governance under an order of liberal internationalism - the slow triumph of international institutions and law over the the anarchy of international power politics among sovereign states."
"January 06, 2010","Revolutions are distinguished by differences in processes, as well as outcomes. By separating revolutionary processes into distinct components, we can distinguish varied types by the sequence and combination in which particular components appear.  In particular, the 'color' revolutions in recent years show a distinct pattern of unfolding.  However, this is not entirely novel – these events share many feature with other revolutions that had previously been considered anomalous, such as the American Revolution, and the British 'Glorious' Revolution of 1688."
"January 06, 2010","We consider a game played by a state sponsor of terrorism, a terrorist group, and the target of terrorist attacks. The sponsoring state wishes to see as much damage inflicted on the target of attack as possible, but wishes to avoid retaliation. To do so, his relationship with the terrorist group must remain ambiguous. The target of attack, for his part, wishes to bring these attacks to an end as quickly as possible and will consider the option of retaliating against the sponsor to do so. We approach the problem by introducing an “evidence” variable in a dynamic setting. We show that the interplay of different strategic and non-strategic effects boils down to three qualitatively different scenarios, determined by key parameters. Based on this result, two alternative instruments to retaliation are identified in order to resist terrorist activities. First, assuming that the target is able to change some parameters by monetary investments, the paper provides an economic analysis of how to invest optimally in order to make the sponsor lose incentives to support the terrorist group. Second, we propose changing the structure of the game. Here, the key insight is that the target country can make a unilateral statement as to his strategy. The sponsor cannot do so as he is in fact claiming that there is no cooperation with terrorist groups. While our discussion, in this article, is motivated by an important problem in contemporary counterterrorism policy, it applies more generally to the study of secret coalitions."
"January 06, 2010","The purpose of this paper is to explore the economic theoretical foundations of the idea that rational terrorist organisations deliberately randomise their attacks (by type, timing, location and targets) to generate uncertainty and intimidation. A choice theoretic framework is applied to the analysis of the terrorist organisation’s behaviour to determine whether welfare (utility) gains from the randomisation of terrorist attacks are plausible and feasible. The results present a challenge to the idea that the randomisation of terrorist attacks is the preferred approach for a rational terrorist organisation. Whilst the randomisation of attacks can, on first inspection, appear to promise higher amounts of political influence for each resource input, it turns out that randomisation cannot, under most circumstances, manufacture a situation where higher amounts of political influence are obtained for each resource input. The results imply that, rather than randomisation and instability, the rational terrorist organisation is more likely to prefer stability. The findings and the associated implications provide a theoretical explanation for the non-randomness of terrorist attacks. This may be one small step towards explaining the patterns – non-randomness – in the time-series of terrorist incidents."
"January 05, 2010","The Hungarian criminal proceedings concerning the prosecution of people responsible for committing alleged breaches of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions during the 1956 revolution have attracted surprisingly little international attention. This lack of interest is all the more astonishing, given the fact that the Hungarian courts directly applied international law for prosecuting criminal offenses and in the course made statements concerning the definition of non-international armed conflict, individual criminal responsibility for violations of Common Article 3 and the application of the 1968 UN Convention on non-applicability of statutory limitations. In the paper I attempt to critically analyse these findings, concentrating on the period between 23 October and 4 November, and demonstrate that even though they do not meet the requirements of international law, some of the perpetrators could be brought to trial even without stretching beyond the confines of the law of nations."
"January 05, 2010","This paper will explore two interwoven themes. Firstly, it will consider the political context that gave rise to the amnesties. In doing this, it will seek initially to evaluate the depth of the international community’s commitment to justice during the conflict by assessing the measures taken by international actors in the response to the violations and the importance given to justice in the various peace initiatives. It will argue that whilst the violence was ongoing, and contrary to the actual crimes being committed within Bosnia-Herzegovina, efforts were made by some international actors and local propagandists to construct a narrative of the violations in which the actions of all sides were described as morally equivalent. The objective of this narrative construction was to lessen demands for justice as it was felt that if the violence was acknowledged as genocide or at least it was widely recognised that Bosnian Serb forces were disproportionately responsible for the commission of war crimes, and the Bosniak civilians suffered disproportionately during the conflict, it would have been more difficult for international mediators to seek to broker a settlement that recognised the ‘facts on the ground’ that had been created by ethnic cleansing. As a result, the international mediators, eager to reach a negotiated settlement, repeatedly prioritised reaching a peace agreement over the pursuit of justice, and even after the ICTY was established, its work was hampered by a lack of funding and cooperation until 1997. The report will also argue that contrary to the behaviour of international actors in other contemporary conflicts, there was, however, a reluctance to agree to an amnesty for war crimes, due to the intense media coverage of the Balkans conflicts and the resultant public outrage. The resultant global awareness and debates on the mass atrocities perpetrated in Bosnia-Herzegovina provided the impetus for the creation by the United Nations of the Commission of Experts and the ICTY. Although the support of international actors for these mechanisms was initially reluctant, the institutions nonetheless gradually gained momentum and the ICTY grew into an effective body commanding significant resources and personnel, and its existence helped to shape the limits of Bosnia’s amnesties."
"January 05, 2010","This chapter focuses on the role of Antonio Cassese in the development of the customary law of non-international armed conflicts. Analyzing the situation before the decision of the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in Tadić, the author submits that there was no general acceptance of a body of customary norms applicable to internal conflicts but the existence of such rules received widespread recognition after the ruling. The central thesis of this paper is that this judgment was opportunistically used by Cassese as a vehicle to ‘humanize’ humanitarian law, i.e. to extend the regulatory framework of international armed conflict to non-international armed conflicts. Following an examination of the process of successful completion of this project, this chapter concludes with the examination of the potential merits and pitfalls of such an endeavour."
"January 05, 2010","This article examines the domestic impact of supranational human rights litigation on acknowledgment of state violence in the context of macroprocesses of global governance. The article’s argument is that the impact of supranational human rights litigation on the process of acknowledgment must be seen through counter-narratives on state violence. The article undertakes a detailed textual analysis of the truth claims and denial strategies that emerged from the European Court of Human Rights proceedings on state violence during Turkey’s struggle against the armed group, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).  It assesses these in the context of the human rights reforms that were created following pressure from European-level governance processes. The article argues that attention must be paid to agency in acknowledgment and truth-telling processes, and points to the limits of technical-bureaucratic forms of human rights reform interventions in the context of state violence."
"January 05, 2010","In exploring the changing role of amnesty in Uganda, this paper will begin by analysing the background to the conflict in northern Uganda, before exploring in Part 3 the crimes and motivations that have characterised this conflict, including crimes committed by both the LRA and the Ugandan state. Subsequently, in Part 4, the current amnesty arrangements will be analysed, including how the amnesty was enacted, implemented and subsequently amended, and the impact that it has had to date within Uganda. The conflict between the Amnesty Act and the indictments issued by the International Criminal Court will be explored in Part 5. Part 6 will then discuss the peace negotiations at Juba and Part 7 will provide an overview of the various transitional justice approaches that were negotiated in the Agreement and Annexure on Accountability and Reconciliation. Finally, some suggestions will be made on the role that amnesty can play during the political transition, if the peace agreement is signed by Joseph Kony and President Museveni."
"January 04, 2010","This article argues that the evolution of Kurdish nationalism in Turkey is more ambivalent and nuanced than is usually acknowledged. This claim is based on three interpretive approaches: 1) The primary actors in national politics are conceptualized as organizations, rather than as ethnic groups; 2) A boundary-making approach to ethnic identities is more promising than an insistence on an ethnic versus civic nationalism dichotomy; and 3) State-society relations are better understood in terms of a series of interactions among state actors and social actors than in terms of a global dichotomy of state and society. These three approaches may help develop answers to important questions regarding political identity in Turkey. First, why do so many Kurdish-speaking citizens fail to articulate their identity in the terms demanded by the Kurdish nationalist movement? Second, why are the electoral returns in those areas of Turkey with large numbers of Kurdish speakers not more closely correlated with the ethnic distribution of the population? Finally, why does the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) often act in ways that are inconsistent with its declared goals of defending and expanding the political and civil rights of the Kurds?"
"December 30, 2009","This document is the paper-format version of the keynote address delivered by its author on August 2, 2009, to the opening session of the Latin American section (AMILAT) of the 15th World Congress of Jewish Studies, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It attempts to understand the long-term shift towards the worse of Israeli-Latin American relations, which started with an almost unqualified support for the establishment of the State of Israel on the side of both Latin American right-wing governments and left-wing parties and popular organizations, but have been deteriorating ever since. It suggests that this involution can be largely explained in terms of at least four intervening variables: Israel’s vulnerability, its special relationship with the United States after 1967, Latin American social structure, and the class identity of the leadership of the Latin American Jewry. It argues that overlooking the peripheral character of Israel in the interstate system has led to distortions in the understanding of Israeli-Latin American relations."
"December 29, 2009","The American military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq are not yielding desired results and, even assuming they were, such military success would not be sufficient to prevail in the war against transnational terrorism. The United States must engage in the battle of hearts and minds in order to achieve meaningful safety and a lasting respite from the specter of terrorist activity. To participate in this more intangible, intellectual battle, the United States will need to utilize its ""soft power,"" or its ability to draw nations or peoples towards its policy preferences through attraction, as distinct from ""hard power,"" in which foreign conduct is shaped by military or economic coercion. The question becomes what soft power resources are available to -- and may be credibly invoked by -- the United States?"

"December 27, 2009","National healing is becoming a highly functional phenomenon  in Africa’s post conflict situations, or in countries that have just emerged from deadly violence be it militarily or as a result of political violence, for instance countries like Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda  among others have  undergone  this, yet it is still uncertain whether national healing has taken place in these countries. The basis of this argument is that the community has been able to find a copying mechanism such as the Garcaca in Rwanda, “mato oput and culo kwor”   in northern Uganda, and the truth and reconciliation ceremony in South Africa, but neither national healing nor reconciliation took place. Currently (2009) Zimbabwe is facing a dilemma on what to do about the nation in terms of national healing; however, the political history in Zimbabwe like the current post election violence of 2008 makes it a necessity for the country to undertake national healing and reconciliation. This paper discusses the situation at the present, and offers a possible way forward. However, the issues in this paper are subject to change due to the contemporary occurrences in Zimbabwe."
"December 26, 2009","State sponsored terrorism is a growing threat to nations of all sizes and in almost every region of the world. Whether highly industrialized or developing, wealthy or poor, all nations, in some way are adversely impacted by terrorism and the lasting repercussions of terrorist activities. In recent years, terrorist attacks have become more brazen and sophisticated. Even more alarming is the fact that terrorist attacks are far more difficult to predict and deter. These attacks follow no particular pattern and are not limited to any specific type of target (Kunreuther, Michel-Kerjan and Porter, 2003).  Historically, terrorists organizations were poorly funded and had to focus a significant amount of time generating revenue to fund their attacks. From a contemporary perspective this is no longer the reality. Modern terrorist organizations are better funded, well organized, and well informed on the nature and dynamics of their targets. This is the case primarily because more terrorist organizations are sponsored by governments in stead of individuals who are loyal to a particular agenda.  Because of this evolution among terrorist organizations it is important than ever that nations of all sizes and in every region of the world understand these facts. This chapter examines the impact of state sponsored terrorism on the social and economic condition of nations.  This review is not intended to be a prescriptive blueprint to fight terrorism for any nation or region, but rather, an examination of relevant facts which will hopefully benefit policy makers and practitioners who work diligently to reduce or eliminate terrorist activities."

The Lower Putumayo (Putumayo), area of application of Plan Colombia, was the region most affected by armed confrontation and thus it presented a greater number of Colombians uprooted. From this region generated the most significant exodus to Ecuador (about 7 million people)."

"December 22, 2009","This article reviews the decisions of UK courts in a case concerning two Iraqi detainees in British military custody who sought to restrain their transfer to Iraqi custody. The detainees claimed that the transfer would violate certain obligations owed to them by the UK under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including the prohibition on torture and the right to a fair trial. The article argues that the case presented novel and complex legal questions for resolution, including whether there was a conflict between the UK's obligations under the ECHR and its obligation to respect Iraqi sovereign jurisdiction over its own nationals on its own territory. It is concluded that important elements of the UK courts’ reasoning were less than satisfactory."

"December 22, 2009","The piece argues that the two messianic faiths - Christianity and Islam - are driven by proselytizing impulses that have violated the cultural integrity and humanity of Africans.  The conscious, willful, and planned displacement of African religions goes beyond the legitimate bounds of religious advocacy and violates the human rights of Africans.  This orchestrated process of the vilification and demonization of African religions represents more than just an attack on the religious freedoms of Africans - it is an act of cultural genocide and a repudiation of the humanity of Africans."
"December 22, 2009","There is a lot of excellent academic, policy and practice work on the links between natural resources and conflict. There are still different viewpoints in the field of the exact relationship of resources to conflict, as people have summed up as the distinction between greed and grievance. However, I think most people would agree, the exploitation of natural resources has played a central role in the conflict in the Great Lakes region and the DRC. This paper offers a perspective on how to transform conflicts by using resources as “tools for reconciliation and reconstruction in the Great Lakes region."
"December 22, 2009","By focusing on the Italian case concerning the ‘extraordinary rendition’ (or in precise legal terms, the abduction) of Mr Abu Omar, this article addresses the obligations states have under the UN Torture Convention to prosecute individuals for torture and complicity in torture occurring as a result of ‘extraordinary renditions’. The article considers the obligation to criminalize complicity in torture and its implementation in Italy. It then analyses the ongoing Italian criminal proceedings concerning the abduction of Mr Abu Omar and concludes that Italy failed to comply with the obligation to prosecute complicity in torture under the Convention for a variety of reasons. In particular, it addresses the issue of ‘state secrecy’, which emerged during the proceedings and was decided upon by the Constitutional Court, and argues that state secrecy cannot be used to avoid compliance with international obligations."
"December 21, 2009","This paper analyzes the relationship between legal empowerment and transitions from dictatorship and mass violence, with particular attention to transitional justice. It aims to provide both conceptual insight and practical recommendations for practitioners of such disciplines as development and human rights. The paper identifies opportunities for promoting legal empowerment during these transitions, including opportunities related to transitional justice processes and institutions. It also considers how legal empowerment can support transitions by reducing the risk of a return to violence, examining the Sierra Leonean NGO Timap for Justice. Legal empowerment is understood as the use of law to help disadvantaged groups (such as the poor or, in many societies, women) expand their influence over their government, their society and their own lives."

Second, I will detail the theories on asserting jurisdiction on an international scale and their application to cyber-terrorism. Case analysis will be used and examined to support conclusions made. Finally, I will consider the solutions and implications for jurisdiction if both the physical and virtual worlds of terrorism collide and, for instance, a cyber-terrorist attack was launched that created what is in essence a physical attack."
"December 20, 2009","This article investigates the structural position of covert (terrorist or criminal) networks. Using the secrecy versus information tradeoff characterization of covert networks it is shown that their network structures are generally not small-worlds, in contradistinction to many overt social networks. This finding is backed by empirical evidence concerning Jemaah Islamiyah's Bali bombing and a heroin distribution network in New York. The importance of this finding lies in the strength such a topology provides. Disruption and attack by counterterrorist agencies often focuses on the isolation and capture of highly connected individuals. The remarkable result is that these covert networks are well suited against such targeted attacks as shown by the resilience properties of secrecy versus information balanced networks. This provides an explanation of the survival of global terrorist networks and food for thought on counterterrorism strategy policy."
"December 16, 2009","Analyst in the strategy and operations of guerrillas and paramilitaries, have suggested that the Colombian conflict analysis should show the differences between clusters paramilitary. Not only because after the 80s, drug trafficking has played a decisive role, but because the geography of territories and control combinations have not been studied sufficiently. Geography of armed conflict should also provide tools to understand the impact of war on natural resources, for example. We sustain that while the drug economy has filtered the structure of semi-groups, promoting market competition and private security protection, drug trafficking does not explain absolutely all sources of violence in Colombia. The strategy of armed conflict has its main actors incentives are deeply rooted in unequal economic relations. There differences between regions in the center and the periphery of the Colombia and asymmetrical forms of development, poverty, unemployment and corruption. These are variables in which the drug is not directly involved but are part of historical attitudes that require our analysis."

"December 15, 2009","Many states in Latin America, Africa and Asia lack the monopoly of violence, identified by Max Weber as the foundation of the state, and thus the capacity to govern effectively. In this paper we develop a new perspective on the establishment of the monopoly of violence and the formation of the state. We build a model to explain the incentive of central states to eliminate non-state armed actors (paramilitaries) in a democracy. The model is premised on the idea that paramilitaries may choose to and can influence elections. Since paramilitaries have preferences over policies, this reduces the incentives of the politicians they favor to eliminate them. The model also shows that while in non-paramilitary areas policies are targeted at citizens, in paramilitary controlled areas they are targeted at paramilitaries. We then investigate the predictions of our model using data from Colombia between 1991 and 2006. We first present regression and case study evidence supporting our postulate that paramilitary groups can have significant effects on elections for the legislature and the executive. Next, we show that the evidence is also broadly consistent with the implication of the model that paramilitaries tend to persist to the extent that they deliver votes to candidates for the executive whose preferences are close to theirs and that this effect is larger in areas where the Presidential candidate would have otherwise not done as well. These results illustrate that, consistent with our model, there appears to be a symbiotic relationship between some executives and paramilitaries. Finally, we use roll-call votes to illustrate a possible ‘quid pro quo’ between the executive and paramilitaries in Colombia."
"December 15, 2009","This paper argues that strength deters violence and weakness elicits it because selection favors moral relativism and choices framed as gains between equals but moral clarity and choices framed as losses as inequalities grow.  Deterrents consist of evolutionarily significant consequences for violent acts, but their credibility (and effects) should vary with the likelihood that people frame choices as gains or losses.  Findings consistent with these claims come from (1) tests for cycle-of-violence effects on structured interview data for 344 post-transition men and women in Barbados, (2) tests for violence exposure effects on structured interview data for 165 men and women from Colombia, Denmark, Israel, South Africa, and the United States, and (3) a comprehensive test for framing effects with a pooled cross-sectional time-series on violent crime rates and the likelihood of evolutionarily significant consequences for violence perpetrators in the United States.  Significant violence rate reductions may come from interventions that target choice frames either directly (for adults) or indirectly, by reducing violence toward children.  The greatest violence rate reductions may require the creation of intervention cultures."

We examine, first, the historical dimension of the position of arbitration in the context of competition law enforcement, second, the powers of arbitrators to apply EU competition law, third, the private international law questions pertaining to the main theme, fourth, the links between arbitration and competition authorities (notably the European Commission), and finally, the question of the review of arbitral awards on public policy grounds, which remains an appropriate final safeguard and ensures a balanced relationship between arbitration and competition law enforcement."
"December 13, 2009","The paper highlights the conflict in benefit sharing among four different communities (hamlets) spread over different geographical areas in a conservation and development programme. Four different hamlets under a single administrative entity (revenue village) are brought under JFPM to manage forests. All the four hamlets are expected to contribute equally to the conservation and management activities. In return, these hamlets are provided financial assistance to be utilised for development activities. Every time, forest department releases the grants under the development component, there is a problem in the Community, as to how the grants are to be shared among different hamlets? It is not merely the money that is involved, it is about, how leaders from different hamlets demand for a share in the grants, which are so small that if shared in different or equal proportions among the hamlets, there is hardly any development activity. It goes on to narrate how the Managing Committee negotiates in the conflict situation with the beneficiaries and how such conflicts can have a negative impact on the conservation activities if there are no policy interventions in unclear cases."
"December 13, 2009","Jan Nederveen Pieterse’s model of ethnic relations is applied to the socio-political unrest of Thailand in the early 21st century. This paper argues that Pieterse’s model of global multiculture and multiethnicity complements Marxist and neo-Marxist explanations of the political unrest in a dialectical relationship. Thus, structural factors such as the economy and the political system are dialectically influenced by cultural and ethnic politics. The use by the royalist elite of state power to install and then defend a national culture (based on a civic religion) is explored in a variety of activities and spheres such as education, the media, usage of public space, economic public policy, religion, and foreign policy. Increasing efforts to defend the Thai ethnocracy are revealed to reflect its weakening vis a vis competing ethnicities and cultures seeking a place in the national culture and socio-political institutions. Finally the paper concludes that renewed calls for greater autonomy for minorities and for the renaming of the country to its old name, Siam, are signs that the country is moving to Pieterse’s third stage of ethnic relations called “ethnic competition” which explains the recent exponential increase in socio-political unrest throughout the entire country."
"December 12, 2009","In this article, I try to empirically apply rational model choice of Collective Action problem to ethnic conflicts in the Balkans (1991-2001). Today many rational theoretical models have been proposed in trying to understand and explain the dynamics of inter-ethnic conflicts. Apart of the formal modeling of inter-ethnic conflict, a normative evaluation of rational solution(s) to the conflicts among ethnic groups is absent. This article poses the Balkan ethnic conflicts as a collective action problem. The different scenario in resolving these conflicts will be discussed and modeled in a rational choice explanation. Apart from formally modeling the solution(s) to inter-ethnic conflicts in the Balkans the importance of normative evaluations as well as the partiality of the solution to the peace agreements accords as an ex-post problem of implementation will be argued."
"December 11, 2009","Born out of the horror of war, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights seems to leave outside any traces of its bellicose ancestry. As a figure of the intimate relationship between the State and its citizens, Human Rights Law reports to the sole domestic sphere of States. Between a Law of War as the perfect expression of States’ sovereignty and an international community still in its infancy, the UDHR seemed to be able to “guide” men and nations only in those periods when the law of armed conflict would not apply. However, the Tadic case shows us that the Declaration has, in practice, played a much more comprehensive role, including the development of the law of armed conflict. The pre-war mainly bilateral scheme was gradually supplanted by a multilateralism which tends to fragmentation, even complexity. Therefore, during the XXth century, the gradual replacement of the “State-sovereignty-oriented approach” by a “human-being-oriented approach” has highlighted the existence of a revolution, a paradigm shift. This new vision of the relationship between human rights and the law of armed conflict enable us to show the existence of a common goal between these two normative corpuses. Therefore we would demonstrate that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the anchor of this revolution."
"December 10, 2009","The basic aspects of the theory of argumentation, the relations of argumentation with the concept of logical inference and a description of argumentation in the analysis of compared international politics are presented in this article. Argumentation will be here understood as part of a deliberative process of pro or against reasoning around certain opinion that might be defended by means of a confrontation of ideas. Therefore, the one who argues proposes, refuses, beats or justifies any understanding of the world. With this in view, a brief description of deductive argumentative systems is undertaken. Some degree of formality, arising from the logics to structure the general argumentative basis, is introduced. Then, an exemplification based on a highly recognized case in international relations is presented: The conditions of public debate that gave birth to the invasion and war in Iraq."
"December 10, 2009","The present paper explores some of the lessons that can be learned from the reigns of the first two Rajahs of the Brook dynasty of Sarawak. They ruled over a realm populated by Malays, Dyaks, Chinese and Europeans with great wisdom and skills. Rajahs James Brooke and Charles Brooke both identified important local capacities for peace and strengthened them so as to keep their multi-ethnic state together. Comparing and contrasting the rule of a British dynasty in Southeast Asia during the colonial period to the post-colonial colonialism of the Thai State in the Deep South shows that some characteristics of traditional colonial rule as exercised by the White Rajahs of Sarawak were more likely to lead to sustainable peace and development than the excesses of post-colonial nationalism."
"December 10, 2009","This work constitutes the first part of a project that identifies three components the conflict and its regional impact: (a) the relevance of geography in the political transformations resulting from the war for local power, (b) the structure financial underpinning training and maintenance of irregular armies within of a given region, (c) correlations that distinguish strategic and / or assimilate groups fighting for territorial dominance. Restrict the search to the first component. Further work needs to teach the correlations between the financing of the conflict, geography and regional identities. It also needs a joint work on the impact it has had the armed conflict in Colombia's political geography."

This cankerworm has eaten deep into the fabrics of the family to the extent that the family is standing precariously at the edge of disintegration. This malady has affected negatively the macrocosm or larger society since the family is its microcosm. The resultant effect is the retardation of social integration, destruction of public morality and regression of National Development. This can become a thing of the past if concerted efforts is put in place to overhaul and transform the family through reducing domestic violence."
"December 09, 2009","The fall of the Berlin Wall is not just the hallmark of the end of the Cold War but also that of fundamental changes in western democracies that have profound impact on the current global fight against terror in general and against radical Islamic terror specifically. I discuss the impact of social and psychological aspects of democracies in the post cold war era and point out to asymmetries in counter terror warfare as well as to dimensions that extend well beyond the battlefield. This paper presents a strategic analysis of the principles of 21st century counter terror warfare and their impact on the operations of democratic military forces. I conclude the paper with a discussion of the fundamental principles of modern counter terror warfare for democracies fighting against contemporary terror rather than insurgency in general."

As the author underlines, this is will on the part of a range of domestic and international actors, whose ability to articulate a clear strategy for enhanced civilian protection will ultimately determine whether vulnerable populations see the consequences of armed conflict reduced. Only on the strength of sustained political commitment, Katshung emphasises, can rhetoric translate into reality."

Their aim is to assess the dynamics of conflict and changes from its author’s scientific output. A context of conflicts that includes new expressions of violence and the relative failure of the paramilitary reintegration involves using new analytical models (argumentation, game theory and inconsistent information). The recent evolution of emerging bands and their expansion into areas that were paramilitary camps requires monitoring not only of the government and the authorities, but those investigating the conflict in the present tense. The author proposes a heuristic research support from the theory of strategy Schelling, agencies and the protection of Nozick, Gambetta recent contributions on the relationship between organized crime and drug cartels."

The families of the dead can mourn and rebuild their lives, but for the families of the Missing there is no end to their pain: Sons, husband, wives and daughters were taken by both parties to the conflict and families still wait to know where they are: Over 1200 remain missing from the conflict and families unaware of their fate. This research aims simply to ask the families of the Missing what they want. The aim is to give a voice to victims, many of whom are traditionally disempowered, so that they can articulate their own needs, in their own terms."

Sets how the private military security companies have acquired the rank of importance in the civil wars, explains why the CMSP has been consolidated as a profitable market for protection and that type of effect has been achieved in Iraq and Colombia, which notes are the dilemmas it has created the presence of the CMSP and the changes it has generated on democracy and the rule of law and finally proposes some reflections on possible political solutions to confront the magnitude of the problem and its international dimensions."
"December 05, 2009","International law promotes global peace and security by providing mechanisms for the pacific settlement of international disputes. This Article examines these mechanisms and their place in the architecture of the international dispute resolution (“IDR”) system. The Article identifies three core deficiencies of the IDR system that limit its effectiveness and capacity. First, the international legal system has prioritized the development of adjudication over other forms of dispute resolution; the judicialization of international disputes and the proliferation of courts and tribunals evidence this  However, adjudication is limited in its capacity to resolve disputes that involve non-state parties and extra-legal issues. This is concerning because empirical studies show that international conflict is increasingly intra-state, and involves non-state actors and extra-legal issues. Second, states prefer mediation to adjudication as a method for resolving disputes that occur in the context of inter-state conflict. Yet the role and value of mediation have been underappreciated, and it lacks institutional support under international law. Third, the current architecture of the IDR system promotes single method approaches, which can foster fragmented IDR approaches that separate legal issues from extra-legal ones, despite their interconnected nature. It also fails to structurally incorporate emerging, hybrid IDR approaches that enhance IDR capacity. In response to these limitations, this Article argues that there is a need to restructure the IDR system to create a framework for understanding how to systematically integrate IDR methods across forums. The Article concludes by considering several challenges that this approach presents to the state-centric foundations of the international legal system."
"December 05, 2009","There is no one who was not pained by the disturbing images coming out of Gaza at the end of December 2008 and in January 2009. Moreover, there is no question that one of the main concerns if not “[t]he principal charge” leveled against Israel’s actions in Gaza at that time relates to the proportionality of Israel’s three-week response to almost a decade of incessant barrages of thousands of rockets and mortar shells fired by Gaza-based terrorists at Israeli civilians, and whether the reaction of Israel to this bombardment constituted war crimes as has been alleged. But does relevant international law, as applied to the facts that have thus far emerged from the three weeks of combat in Gaza, support contentions of the commission of war crimes asserted against Israel for allegedly acting in a disproportionate fashion? The answer is “no.” In other words, under applicable international law Israel did not carry out war crimes in this regard. Since 2001, terrorism from Gaza has taken the form of more than 8,000 rockets and mortar shells indiscriminately fired at Israel’s southern region, causing many casualties."
"December 04, 2009","Information sources, creation of informant networks and labors of local intelligence have become very important goals in political power calculations of the paramilitary and insurgents. Phenomena of information and rumor can disclose central aspects to understand the direction of events yet to be seen in local politics. The text presents a phenomenological analysis of information (and its deviations) to understand the dynamics of armed conflict at a local level."
"December 03, 2009","This article uses a gender lens to explore how conflict affects men and women differently.  It examines issues related to the emergence of certain kinds of “hyper” masculinity in situations of conflict and how such masculinities continue to function in subsequent peace-building attempts. The article argues that a failure to account for and be cognizant of these specific masculinities has a significant effect for women in particular, and, more generally, on the success of the conflict transition process. Finally, we show how using a gender lens could make a difference by considering the specific example of the impact of violent masculinities on disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programs."
"December 02, 2009","Realism, a useful theory for the study of International Relations, is all the more useful when married with Constructivism.  Key concepts such as power, borders, and national security are social constructs that require interpretation.  This paper examines the social construction of borders in the United States by examining how their enforcement and militarization has changed over time.  The rhetoric of threats to national security, which have had little to do with the actual enforcement of borders, demonstrates the dangers of considering security to be an ""objective"" fact. The questionable deportation of millions of undocumented workers, under the guise of national security policy, demonstrates the dangers of using borders and national security as independent variables without giving heed to how those concepts are constructed."
"December 02, 2009","What explains the variation in terrorism within and across political regimes? We contend that terrorism is most likely to occur in contexts in which governments cannot credibly restrain themselves from abusing their power in the future. We consider a specific institutional arrangement, whether a state has an independent judiciary, and hypothesize that independent judiciaries make government commitments more credible, thereby providing less incentive for the use of terrorism. Using a recently released database that includes transnational and domestic terrorist events from 1970-1997, we estimate a set of statistical analyses appropriate for the challenges of terrorism data and then examine the robustness of the results. The results provide support for the credible commitment logic and offer insights into the different ways that political institutions increase or decrease terrorism."
"December 02, 2009","It is possible to say that at present the system of consideration and resolution of employment disputes in the Russian Federation is still under development. Its structure and size, as well as a scope of competence of its particular participants, etc. are still changing. At the same time it is important to note that employees and employers no longer regard a court to be an alien element of the process of protecting their employment rights. They actively use all options given to them by contemporary Russian labour and employment legislation."
"December 01, 2009","Most aid spending by governments seeking to rebuild social and political order is based on an opportunity-cost theory of distracting potential recruits. The logic is that gainfully employed young men are less likely to participate in political violence, implying a positive correlation between unemployment and violence in locations with active insurgencies. We test that prediction in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Philippines, using survey data on unemployment and two newly-available measures of insurgency: (1) attacks against government and allied forces; and (2) violence that kills civilians. Contrary to the opportunity-cost theory, the data emphatically reject a positive correlation between unemployment and attacks against government and allied forces (p"

"December 01, 2009","Though the Framers could never have imagined the technological world in which we currently live, we call upon them nonetheless to help us answer the most vexing social and legal problems that arise in this modern age. Recently, scholars have asked how the Framers’ views can guide our understanding of the Internet – a medium which assuredly they could not have anticipated. This Article continues that conversation by exploring James Madison’s Federalist No. 10, perhaps his most revered contribution to American political theory, and proposing how it may be of relevance to cyberspace in the post-9/11 context."
"December 01, 2009","The European Union's security and defence policy (ESDP) was invented 10 years ago and has been operational for more than five years. During this period the EU has launched over 20 ESDP missions allowing the organization to be engaged in international crisis management in various ways. The coming years will reveal whether the European Union is able to meet its ambitions to carry out a greater number of more complex ESDP missions in higher-risk theatres. While the EU has stepped up the plate to meet these challenges, the three case studies discussed in this article (EULEX Kosovo, EUPOL Afghanistan, EUFOR Tchad/RCA) reveal that the path paved with good intentions might in this case indeed lead to hell. Whereas the new Treaty of Lisbon introduces quite a few institutional changes to the current treaty regime of foreign affairs and security policy, it is questionable whether these innovations will significantly improve the decision-making and leadership on issues of ESDP and, consequently, the effectiveness of the Union as an international crisis manager."
"November 30, 2009","What is the ground by virtue of which the discipline of International Relations (IR) may claim authoritative knowledge of its subject?  Why should officials charged with making policy consult and even defer to the findings, the forecasts, the expert advice of mere scholars?  Why aren’t the practitioners of international politics - career diplomats, statesmen - held (as much by themselves as by us) to be the reigning experts?  The answer is obvious: IR lays claim to ‘knowledge in its most stringent sense and in its highest form’ through ‘adherence to the standard of knowledge’, (Bueno de Mesquita, 1985: 123, emphasis added) that is, to the scientific standard.  Only this claim to dignity makes it conceivable that men of affairs would give ear to prognostications regarding the outcome of this election or the results of that policy, especially when those predictions seem contrary to their plain view of things or ‘gut feelings’."
"November 28, 2009","A series of incidents including the Polish agricultural row, the Estonian monument crisis, the Lufthansa Cargo dispute and the Litvinenko affair, have suggested that bilateral disputes between EU member states and Russia have begun to dominate overall EU–Russian relations. This paper employs a case-study approach to provide an in-depth analysis of selected disputes and reviews several questions of importance for EU coherence: What kinds of issues are at the heart of bilateral disputes? What strategies do member states adopt to resolve them? Under what circumstances are disputes raised to the EU level and what measures does the EU take? These questions are examined along with those surrounding EU solidarity in the midst of bilateral frictions. Drawing insights from the case studies, the paper concludes with a set of guidelines for the EU’s approach."
"November 28, 2009","Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) Attacks are a major weapon of cyberwarfare and are now also used during or before major political and military conflicts, such as the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the Russian- Estonian political tensions as well as in the Middle East conflict. International Law is based on consensus and therefore naturally slow to react to new developments including this new tool of warfare. The same is true of many states. This raises the question of how to qualify DDoS Attacks under the existing rules of Public International Law. After investigating the legal nature of DDoS Attacks, the question needs to be asked which rules cover such attacks and who can be held responsible for DDoS Attacks, in particular such attacks which are conducted by (potentially paid and/or foreign) hackers on behalf of states."
"November 27, 2009","It is known that before the advent of colonialism, Africa had a system of justice and adjudication hence, making the people conform to the ethos of the community, but the coming of colonialism has changed the people’s cognitive mapping of what constitute social order and control through the introduction of new methods leading to the abandonment of the traditional that was instant, efficient and effective. This study examines the perception of the people towards traditional methods of social control in the face of modernization. The study utilized structured questionnaire to examine the people’s acceptance or appreciation of traditional methods of social control in the modern world. The study found among other things that most communities have abandoned their traditional methods of social control. The Christian Religion has changed the people’s perception and attitudes towards traditional methods of social control. That the modern methods of social control have not succeeded in adequately reducing crime and building confidence on peace making and conflict management. There is an urgent need to synchronize the modern and traditional methods of social control to create a synergy for better security network. This will enable society to protect its people by creating in them confidence in the social control mechanism."
"November 25, 2009","I propose a framework within which to interpret and evaluate the major reforms introduced to the GATT system in its transition to the WTO. In particular, I examine the WTO Agreement on Safeguards that has replaced the GATT escape clause (Article XIX), and the Dispute Settlement Process (DSP) that resembles a court of law under the WTO. Using this framework, I interpret the weakening of the reciprocity principle under the Agreement on Safeguards as an attempt to reduce efficiency-reducing trade skirmishes. The DSP is interpreted as an impartial arbitrator that announces its opinion about the state of the world when a dispute arises among member countries. I demonstrate that the reforms in the GATT escape clause should be bundled with the introduction of the DSP, in order to maintain the incentive-compatibility of trade agreements.  The model implies that trade agreements under the WTO lead to fewer trade skirmishes but this effect does not necessarily result in higher payoffs to the governments. The model also implies that the introduction of the WTO court, which has no enforcement power, can in fact improve the self-enforceability of trade agreements."
"November 24, 2009","Studies of cultural resilience concentrate on socio-cultural processes that allow societies to resist the erosive strain of socio-economic marginality and in response create social networks that provide cultural resilience. This study of a chronically poor, United States (U.S.) African-American urban community in Champaign, Illinois, examines the community's adaptation to structurally generated socioeconomic marginality. This study finds that the theory of balanced, socioeconomic exchange relations helps to understand the intricate social dynamics of cultural resilience. The adaptive advantage of balanced exchange relationships are confirmed by an empirical analysis of personal social network data gathered female gang members."
"November 24, 2009","The estimation of the costs of conflict is currently receiving a lot of attention in the literature. This paper aims to give a thorough overview of the existing literature, first by addressing the history of case studies that address conflict costs and second by looking at the existing body of cross-country analyses for conflict costs. In addition to the existing cross-country literature, a number of studies that only concern themselves with particular elements of conflict costs are included as well. In the end, this paper combines the insights from these previous analyses to explore how much room there is to further improve the existing studies. Specific recommendations are given how to proceed with the development of the field of conflict cost measurement."
"November 24, 2009","The world of crises and disasters is changing rapidly. We are witnessing new types of adversity. In addition, modern societies have become increasingly vulnerable to disruptions, new and old. This new world demands new types of responses, which nation states cannot produce alone. Nation states will have to cooperate to protect their citizens from these threats. This article investigates the role of the European Union in the development of new safety and security arrangements. It identifies conceptual building blocks for a new security paradigm and offers design principles that can facilitate a shared way of thinking and acting in the safety and security domain."
"November 24, 2009","This article probes the warning-response failures that left the city of New Orleans vulnerable to catastrophic hurricanes and the inability of local, state, and federal authorities to mount an adequate response to the consequences unleashed by Hurricane Katrina. Through an empirical exploration with the help of three broad explanatory ‘cuts’ derived from the relevant interdisciplinary literature – psychological, bureau-organizational, and agenda-political – the authors seek to shed light on the sources of failure that contributed to the various levels of governments' lack of preparedness and the inadequate collective response to a long-predicted, upper-category hurricane. The article concludes by addressing the question of whether the vulnerabilities and problems that contributed to the Katrina failure are amenable to reform."

"November 23, 2009","The extreme urgency in discussing terror bombings and anticipatory self-defense cannot be overstated. Terror bombings were responsible for the single bloodiest month for U.S. and British troops in Afghanistan (July, 2009), for the death of nine people in Indonesia (July, 2009) for the death of three policemen in Spain and for the death of countless Iraqi citizens (including August, 2009), just to name a few.  This article specifically focuses on anticipatory self defense and intelligence gathering in an effort to proactively prevent terror bombings. Terror bombing is defined herein within the broadest possible parameters to include the following: dirty bombs, suicide bombings, remote controlled bombings and nuclear weapons and presents the greatest contemporary threat presently posed by terrorists.  Therefore, it is critical that terror bombings are understood and effective counter-measures developed.  The most effective way to understand the threat is through a detailed comparative analysis of terror bombings and the operational, policy, legislative, and judicial responses of the nations affected.  In the article, I propose that the key to pre-empt, prevent and respond to the threats posed by terror bombings is stronger intelligence which is crucial in allowing nations to focus on effective anticipatory self-defense."
"November 21, 2009","This short paper concentrates on three powerful ideas introduced by three important theorists, namely, Merton’s interpretation of anomie in America, Fromm’s critical aesthetics regarding man’s consciousness in relation to nature, and finally Du Bois’ concept of the “racial wage” (Lemert, 2004, pp. 218-240). Those theories are then applied to the Japanese phenomenon of the “compensated date” and the Thai “sex industry”."
"November 21, 2009","Violence is a phenomenon with deep economic and social roots, but the most important factor that impels it is the capitalist production way: This is the generator of “basic violence”. And one develops itself in different forms that go from the individual and innermost to the social and international. Basic violence has structural characteristics, which implies structural solutions. The Colombian state must bear the expenses for being one of the creators of violence in the past. Peace negotiations are out of focus because they do not touch the real problems. Several economic sectors will keep suffering crises if we do not change our perspective."
"November 18, 2009","Detainees were sent to Guantánamo Bay to be exploited for intelligence purposes, not to perfect criminal cases against them. The effort to construct credible criminal cases based upon intelligence was going to be problematic, and it became even more so when President George W. Bush decided in the summer of 2006 to transfer high value detainees from secret Central Intelligence Agency sites, where some were subjected to torture, to military detention at Guantánamo Bay. The former chief prosecutor for the military commissions describes the decision to create “clean teams” of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and military law enforcement personnel to interview the high value detainees anew at Guantánamo Bay in hopes of separating the criminal prosecution effort from the earlier intelligence gathering phase. The merits of that decision will be tested as President Barack Obama’s administration moves forward with the prosecution of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other high value detainees."
"November 17, 2009","Paul Rogers is one of the foremost British academic commentators on the American led ‘war on terror.’ Like all ambitious and mature scholars, he takes as his field the entire terrain of conflict, from the technological and economic factors, to the political, social and ideational factors that have shaped public policy. Rogers’ view is refreshing because he is not bound by the traditional strictures of critical political economy that tend to place undue emphasis on single factors. While he quite rightly places the economics of national interest squarely in his sights, he also takes a great deal of effort to show how both technological and ideational factors come into play. It is a rare scholar indeed who is as comfortable discussing weapons systems as he is discussing dispensation theology."
"November 17, 2009","In recent years, corporate social responsibility (CSR) of Multinational Corporations (MNCs) in developing countries has received more attention. However, in this literature Africa is much less well represented than other regions, and existing studies about Africa have mainly focused on South Africa and Nigeria. This focus has resulted in scant research on other African countries where MNCs are located as well, and where their presence is notable. Settings largely unexplored include conflict-ridden areas in Central Africa where a limited number of usually large MNCs can potentially have a large impact on the local situation and play a role in addressing the huge problems with which these countries are confronted. Moreover, the MNCs themselves face large CSR dilemmas, related to the contribution they can (or cannot) give in the different setting compared to their home countries as well as their attitude vis-à-vis ongoing conflicts. To help shed light on these issues, this paper explores how MNCs report on CSR and conflict in three Central African countries (Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Republic of the Congo). Our analysis of company information reveals that opportunities are widely seen and that most MNCs report on their economic and social impacts. However, CSR reporting is fairly generic and the specific context seems to bear little influence on the type of CSR activities. The conflict dimension also receives limited attention, although some companies show awareness and outline the limitations of their power and the dilemmas inherent to their presence in these countries. The potential for MNCs’ involvement in (co)creating sustainable economies is recognised, and needs further research attention in the coming years."
"November 17, 2009","Current strategy in Afghanistan starkly illustrates the extraordinary challenges new warfare poses for commanders on the ground.

From both a domestic and an international point of view, Eritrea's geo-political situation points to its detachment from Ethiopia."
"November 13, 2009","This article places the emerging “responsibility to protect” within the historical development of international human rights and criminal law, while also attempting to more fully theorize the responsibility to ensure that it can be a basis for action in the face of a state’s commission of atrocities against its citizens. The main point of departure concerns the issue of “right authority” at that point in time when a coercive intervention is justified. Rather than rely solely on the Security Council in these situations, this article contends that unilateral and multilateral action must be countenanced by a fully theorized “responsibility to protect.” Such action is the only likely action to be taken in many circumstances, on account of the self-interest of Security Council members and general apathy towards intervention in the United Nations. There are solid legal and policy grounds for permitting such interventions and no compelling arguments to the contrary. Without sanctioning such action, it is very likely that the responsibility to protect will become just another quaint theory in international law, irrelevant to on the ground decision-making and incapable of the protection it was created to provide."

The expression ‘residual mechanisms’ is commonly used to describe the set of means and procedures to deal with functions that are now carried out by the ICTY (and by other international and hybrid tribunals more generally), which might be required even after it has completed all trial and appellate proceedings. This is a broad topic which has, however, only recently captured the attention of NGOs, scholars and commentators."
"November 12, 2009","The idea to publish a volume of detainee poetry came to me, oddly enough, while I was reading a book of poems written by a U.S. infantry team leader during his stint in the Iraq War. As I paged through Brian Turner's Here, Bullet, I was struck by how the soldier-poet opened himself to the strangeness of the Mesopotamian war zone, shoring fragments from the battlefield to build poems of terrible stillness and beauty."
"November 12, 2009","For academics, Guantánamo is an intellectual feast. Thanks to the administration's decision to detain suspected terrorists in the supposedly lawless void of an offshore prison camp, we have been busy for years debating fundamental issues concerning the extraterritorial reach of the Constitution, [FN1] the office of “the Great Writ,” [FN2] the powers of the executive during wartime, [FN3] and even the definition of “war” itself. [FN4] For those of us who still believe our nation can serve as a beacon of human rights for the world, these scholarly questions are a live and pressing concern, not least because they are susceptible to no easy answers. In forums like this one, we accordingly exercise our solemn duty to wrestle with big ideas, so that we may police our judges and elected officials to assure they maintain their intellectual honesty."
"November 12, 2009","Since the start of the modern civil rights era, the notably harsh laws of citizenship and immigration in the United States  have experienced some mitigation in the critical distinctions between  citizens and aliens. Societies became “soft” on the “inside” while grappling with questions of how “hard” to be toward  the “outside,” the border. The retrograde effects of globalization together with our security and imperial obsessions since 9/11, however, have led to a hardening of distinctions both on the inside and toward the outside.  Immigration and citizenship have become more Schmittian affairs where the worthy “us” is confronted by the enemy “other.”  The power of exclusion and especially of deportation has again grown more important (as it was during the Red Scares of the post-WWI and Cold War periods), making citizenship more important. As the government seeks to undermine constitutional protections in three ways — making it irrelevant who you are, where you are, or whose custody you are in — the benefits of the legal status of “citizen” seem to be in play.  At the same time, we know the importance of citizenship as a mechanism for the defense of rights, perhaps especially of minority rights.  Indeed, liberal immigration scholars have spent most of the past generation fretting over the discriminatory “bonus” offered by citizenship and have worked “human rights” and “due process” discourses to undermine that bonus.  Since 9/11, however, a series of important Supreme Court cases has left us with only a murky sense of what rights apply to whom and where and how much of a guarantee “citizenship” offers. In this essay, we review the salient cases and seek to identify some current baselines around these “who, where, and whom” questions."
"November 12, 2009","November 19, 2004. I am sitting in an interview cell - really, a retrofitted storage container - in Camp Echo at Guantánamo Bay. Across the table, Adnan sits with his arms crossed and his head down. The guards have removed his handcuffs, but when he shifts his weight, his leg-irons clang and echo in the bare room. The irons are chained to an eyebolt on the floor. Guards are stationed outside the door, and I can see a video camera in the corner."
"November 11, 2009","ASEAN is an enduring regional organization in East Asia. However, its claims to being central to any talks on regional architecture are challenged by a multiplicity of factors both external and internal to it. This paper assesses ASEAN’s centrality by looking into the possible challenges facing it, which inevitably affects its claim to be the central organization in managing the direction of the wider region. It then offers possible ways forward so that it can retain its leadership and prove to be a credible driver for regional cooperation."
"November 11, 2009","This article identifies various duties of cooperation both in political and legal settlement strategies. A general, customary law-based duty of cooperation with a view to settlement, comprising a duty to negotiate, is inherent in the obligation to settle disputes peacefully. On the other hand, a general ‘political exhaustion doctrine’ does not exist. In diplomatic third party-based settlement, we find specific, i.e. procedural, obligations of cooperation. With regard to adjudication, the evolution of treaty law has seen the cooperational act of submission given at an increasingly early stage. The doctrine of non-frustration of adjudication functions as a corollary to the duties of cooperation. In international criminal justice, manifold duties of cooperation are binding erga omnes partes. The cooperational duties are placed in the context of two antagonistic trends in dispute settlement. One is the rise of adjudication which is found, for instance, in the creation of new courts. On the other hand, new and varied political means are resorted to, and justified by novel arguments, such as alternative dispute resolution (ADR). The international law of dispute settlement may be envisaged as a network of obligations. The hierarchical strand of the network is dominant where (quasi-)compulsory jurisidiction exists. Yet horizontal Westphalian elements persist. Finally, the network image applied to dispute settlement visualizes the oscillation of international law between Westphalianism and Constitutionalism."
"November 11, 2009","Computing a value for the coefficients of relative and absolute risk aversion that describe  terroristic agents is a task of the utmost importance for the defense economist. Terrorists are willing, like all risk-averse agents, to take tremendous risks if they expect to be rewarded, on average and in some way, for doing so. The coefficients of relative and absolute risk aversion determine the terroristic agents’ selection of the optimal decision from the choice set of attack method combinations. Furthermore, there are relevant proofs in micro-economic theory concerning the ‘longevity’ of agents with particular utility functions. These have hitherto unrecognized relevance to the study of terroristic behavior. The values for the coefficients of relative and absolute risk aversion will be consistent with particular specifications (log, power and so on) of utility functions. Theoretically, it can be shown that terroristic agents with log utility functions will exhibit longevity. Terroristic agents with non-log utility functions will become extinct. The study of risk aversion has implications for the prediction from micro-economic theory of which terroristic groups will survive in the long run. The analysis presented herein computes a value of 0.56 for Al-Qa`ida’s relative risk aversion coefficient. This value is too low to be consistent with logarithmic utility."
"November 09, 2009","This paper is a chapter for a forthcoming book, Prosecuting the Bush Administration: What Does the Rule of Law Require?  The book does not debate whether the Bush administration violated the law in the course of the War on Terror and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq through such actions as torture.  Rather, it assumes for purposes of debate that violations of the law occurred, and asks, if that is so, whether the rule law requires prosecution."
"November 06, 2009","The global chase for terrorist assets has shed light on a link between tax and terrorism. Tax havens have been associated with terrorist finance, identified as potential centres for filtrating terrorist assets and for enabling the cross-border movement of the resources destined for terrorist enterprises. Complex multi-jurisdictional financial transactions have become the venues for the merger of terrorist finance with other mobile capital, its criminally ordained purpose hidden midst the convolutions of international tax and related transactions."
"November 06, 2009","This essay describes how Israeli students in a course on mediation and consensus building taught in an Israeli university law department by an American law professor and an Israeli instructor analyzed and studied the conflict in the Middle East. It describes the suggestions they made for process design for the next stages of whatever peace process might emerge for the region. In light of the students’ suggestions, the authors present some ideas as to how different approaches to reconciliation and peace might be used, managed, and coordinated."
"November 06, 2009","Within days of his inauguration as president, Barack Obama authorized the CIA to continue President Bush’s policy of attacks using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) in Western Pakistan.  In fact, President Obama authorized a significant increase in drone attacks.  These attacks cannot be justified under international law for a number of reasons.  First drones launch missiles or drop bombs, the kind of weapons that may only be used lawfully in armed conflict hostilities.  Until the spring of 2009, there was no armed conflict on the territory of Pakistan because there was no intense armed fighting between organized armed groups.  International law does not recognize the right to kill with battlefield weapons outside an actual armed conflict.  The so-called “global war on terror” is not an armed conflict.  In addition, members of the CIA are not lawful combatants and their participation in killing—even in an armed conflict—is a crime.  Members of the United States armed forces could be lawful combatants in Pakistan if Pakistan expressly requested United States assistance in an armed conflict against insurgent forces.  No express request of this nature has been made.  Even if it were made, drone attacks may well be unlawful under the international law governing the conduct of conflict.  The CIA’s intention in using drones is to target and kill individual leaders of al-Qaeda or Taliban militant groups.  Drones have rarely, if ever, killed just the intended target.  By October 2009, the ratio was about 20 leaders killed for 750-1000 unintended victims, raising serious questions about compliance with the principle of proportionality.  Even if the loss of civilian lives is not disproportionate, counter-terrorism studies show that military force is rarely effective against terrorism, making the use of drones difficult to justify under the principle of necessity."
"November 05, 2009","The role of mandatory rules in international arbitration remains a persistent source of debate. The basic problem is a straightforward one: contractual arbitration arises as a matter of the parties’ consent, but the resolution of contractual disputes can implicate mandatory rules of law that are not waivable and are typically designed to protect broader public rights. The literature has often presented the issue in terms of conflict between the authority of the state and the party-derived authority of the arbitrator. Asserting an independent public duty to protect national mandatory laws as well as the enforceability of arbitral awards, some writers have urged arbitrators to apply a so-called “mandatory rules method” to determine, irrespective of the parties’ agreement, which particular mandatory rules to apply in a particular dispute."
"November 04, 2009","This article offers a framework for understanding the democratic peace phenomenon across three levels of analysis. Specifically, Kohlberg’s structural-development model of moral reasoning offers an understanding of how individuals (e.g., national leaders, public officials) may approach ethically difficult decisions, such as whether or not to engage in war.  In turn, this supports the normative strain of the democratic peace argument.  Further, by applying a social constructivist approach to our understanding of the interaction between individual actors and social mores, the normative power and social foundation of the democratic peace argument is clarified. Finally, I argue that modernization & cultural change data from the World Values Survey supports the normative democratic peace proposition. Thus, I examine three different bodies of literature - individual moral development, normative democratic peace, and neo-modernization – and argue that the three are interrelated and aspects of the same meta-process. Therefore, I suggest a more complex, social understanding of non-conflict, predicated on normative and cultural-value ‘proximity’, which has been neglected in the literature, since most democratic peace scholars focus on structural explanatory variables."
"November 04, 2009","This Comment analyzes the unfortunate role that the ICC played in the Juba peace talks between the Lord's Resistance Army and the Government of Uganda between 2006 and 2008.  Drawing on that saga, the Comment argues that the Rome Statute should be amended in the upcoming 2010 review conference in Kampala, Uganda to provide a greater opportunity for peace negotiations to succeed in situations where the ICC has issued an indictment against one party to those negotiations.  The argument proceeds in three parts."
"November 03, 2009","I argue that international politics - and globalization in particular - must be understood by tracing their historical development. Many of the present phenomena of 'globalization' have their roots in the expansion of the European state system.  Consequently, I undertake a structured, comparative case study analysis of four regions (the Northwest coast of America, the Asante Kingdom of West Africa, Abyssinia, and Japan) and examine how they were absorbed into the expanding European-centered state system. I trace the process of incorporation, and develop a refined model of incorporation, including the development of a 'zone of ignorance' beyond the ‘known’ world which serves as an enabling mechanism for actors promoting incorporating behavior (i.e., exploration, colonization, conquest). In addition to textual analysis, I also use historically contemporary maps to 'operationalize' the stages of systemic expansion. This allows cross-temporal comparison of event-contexts with regard to the incorporation process, without having to 'anchor' the time-frame across cases; one can focus on process rather than era. I argue that significant socio-cultural, political, and economic change occurs upon contact between civilizations, and that these early changes have been largely overlooked in current international relations literature. Quite simply, the rules of the game and the agenda for negotiations are solidified rather early, well before most scholars examine the processes associated with globalization."
"November 03, 2009","Written for a forthcoming book (H. Irving, J. Mowbray & K. Walton (eds) Julius Stone: A Study in Influence (Federation Press, forthcoming), this chapter contributes to a series of studies seeking to gauge what has been made of the work of international lawyer and legal theorist Julius Stone. Among Stone’s possible intellectual progeny, this chapter focuses on an obstreperous and, at times, ungrateful brood: scholars and teachers of international law in Australia. Focusing on a forty year period from the 1954 publication of Stone’s first book-length work in international law, Legal Controls of International Conflict, this chapter begins an assessment of the influences - direct and indirect - of Stone’s work upon international legal scholarship in Australia. In so doing, this chapter uses Stone’s role and impact in international legal scholarship in Australia as a way of reflecting on two, broader sets of questions. First, to what extent or in what ways might the Australian legal academy be understood to have ‘received’ American legal realism? If, as Neil Duxbury would have it, American legal realism was more a ‘mood’ than a coherent movement, how has that mood featured in the affective, performative and constative repertoire of legal scholarship in Australia? Second, what might the life or lifelessness of American legal realism in the Australian academy (traced through a single capillary: the impact of Julius Stone’s version in international law), suggest about the vagaries and the stakes of legal transfer in the scholarly domain? What questions might this account pose for students of legal transfer working with the rubrics of ‘transplant’ (Watson), or ‘palace wars’ (Dezalay and Garth)?"
"November 03, 2009","This paper situates the topic of 'honor' in the middle ground between notions of identity and perceptions of rule violation, which is then treated as a signaling and mobilizational element in the escalation of conflict (for example, as either righting a wrong or as punishing a transgressor).  Inherent in the discussion of honor is the notion of transgression (as causing dishonor) which then requires redress. This paper explores the relationship between rule violation and perceived injustice as proximate starting points for a reinvigorated discourse of conflict escalation, inclusive of socially constructed elements such as honor. An honor-framed discourse can be viewed as a potential crisis signal of impending conflict escalation as well as a medium for comprehending escalation itself, especially in terms of appreciating 'appropriate' resolutions to conflict as punishment for rule violation."
"November 01, 2009","In the context of increased scrutiny of humanitarian assistance over the past decade, issues around the accountability of international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) - and the perceived lack thereof - have been discussed widely and frequently. This reflects the recognition of both the increased relevance of INGOs and of the underlying problems associated with their role. Donor agencies in particular have become increasingly concerned with the accountability of the operational agencies they fund, who in return have put in place elaborate evaluation processes and systems. What characterizes these approaches and how are they affecting the ways agencies operate and pursue their humanitarian missions? Were agencies successful in addressing accountability deficits and in correcting the respective incentives towards positive change in humanitarian action? When examining the prevailing practices of major humanitarian INGOs, this research identified not only a general absence of critical self-reflection and meaningful concern over achieved impact, but also a remarkable resistance of the same dilemmas that triggered the call for an ‘accountability revolution’ in the first place. Highlighting considerable weaknesses in the governance of these INGOs, this article confirms also a growing frustration among humanitarian professionals themselves that, while much is measured and evaluated, it is rarely the actual impact of their work. Instead it is apparent that evaluation as it mostly takes place today reflects primarily the needs of donors; is irrelevant for serious organizational learning and programming efforts; adds considerably to the burden of local staff and partners; and does little to shed light on the roles, influence and impact of INGOs as central actors in humanitarian action and protection."
"October 31, 2009","It has previously been shown that civil conflict influences many economic factors, including education, which play an important role in development and economic growth. Previous authors working on the influence of conflict on education have, however, always focused strongly on the supply-side effects, whereas this paper examines the influence of conflict on the demand for education. It is theoretically shown that, under relatively general conditions, individuals living in a conflict area have an incentive to increase their level of education and that this effect depends on the individual's skill level. This hypothesis is then tested using the conflict in the Basque Region as a case study, which is an example of a conflict in which one would not expect strong supply-side effects. Using the other Spanish regions, an artificial region is created in which the population has a similar educational distribution as in the Basque Region. When comparing the true and artificial regions, it can clearly be seen that for individuals with a medium level of education, there is a strong incentive to increase their education level, which is in concordance with the theoretical model."
"October 31, 2009","This article, written in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, questions the failure of Muslims strongly to condemn acts of violence and murder committed by Islamic extremists, and argues that such silence encourages neutral parties to wonder if moderate Muslims may indeed sympathize with ""the killers of 'infidels'"" - which in turn can lead to fear, bias, and group defamation."
"October 30, 2009","In this paper, we study the evolution of private military corporations (PMCs), which are for-profit organizations that subcontract military field services to sovereign authorities as well as to others.  Between Eisenhower’s famous “military-industrial complex” speech in 1961 and the post-9/11 war in Iraq, PMCs were transformed from relatively minor subcontractors to major companies with unique capabilities that made them strategically central to the sovereign military organizations from which they had grown. Throughout this period, PMCs exhibited a “hybrid organizational form” as delineated within organizational economics. Our purpose is grounded theorizing in which we derive insights about the evolution of PMCs as hybrid organizational forms. Our analysis suggests that hybrid forms of organization enable transactions and capability development that are not possible within either markets or hierarchies. Hybrid forms may thus represent a conduit for institutional entrepreneurship and the emergence of new industry structures. Their intertemporal characteristics warrant further theoretical study."
"October 30, 2009","In this paper, we analyze transnational support for insurgent groups from principal agent perspective. We focus on both the supply side, i.e., when other states are willing to support insurgent groups in other states, and the demand side, i.e., when groups are willing to accept such support, with the strings that this may entail. We test our hypotheses using new disaggregated data on insurgent groups. Our results suggest that transnational rebel support is influenced both by characteristics of the rebel groups as well as linkages between rebel groups and actors in other countries. More specifically, we find that transnational support is more likely for moderately strong groups, where support is more likely to be influential, in the presence of transnational constituencies, and when the government receives foreign support. By contrast, conventional country characteristics believed to influence the outbreak of civil war appear to be unrelated to whether rebels receive transnational support."
"October 29, 2009","United States law, in accordance with customary international law, has since 1798 permitted the internment or restriction of enemy aliens found within the United States during time of international conflict or war.  Application of this law and related precedent to the present Long War (or Global War on Terror) permits the detention or restriction of aliens known or suspected of links to foreign terrorist organizations.  In light of the United States’ new policy to end detention of combatants in Guantanamo Bay, this statute presents a secure alternative to the complete release of the detainees, or to their introduction into the civilian criminal justice system."
"October 29, 2009","Historically, terrorism as phenomenon exists since antics and very often it has been source of dramatic legal, political and social changes. Meanwhile, during globalization process, terrorism became one of the fundamental problems of majority states, when it outgrew in international phenomenon de facto. Theory of international law has general and common apprehension of basic characteristics of this phenomenon, which constitutes of very dangerous groups or organizations that are operating against rule of law, state system, international peace, stability and security, by violating international law rules, but also all existing civilized states norms. But, precise, universally accepted definition of terrorism in international law does not exist. This paper deals with concept, classification, typology, elements, actors, causes, motives, goals, methods, means, manifestation and effects of terrorism in international law."
"October 28, 2009","The relation between narcotic and terrorism defines a new form of mutual cooperation and relation of criminals known as narco-terrorism. It is supposed that the illegal activities based on narcotics and drugs financially support terrorism. About Afghanistan, terrorism and narcotics (especially cultivating of poppy) are the two major and expanding problems in this country. Afghan government along with all other countries supporting Afghanistan has less success in rooting out these two problems. Some evidences show that there is close relation between narcotic and terrorism and insurgency groups (Taliban), but the narcotic problem seems more complicated in Afghanistan. There are different groups of people who cultivate poppy so different solutions should be held simultaneously. Therefore, the solution for eradication of poppy should be comprehensive and different. Thus I suggest some Social and Economical solutions as well as maintaining present policies and strategies for it."
"October 26, 2009","Over the past decades, scholars have paid greater attention to sexual violence, in both theorization and empirical analysis. One area that has been largely ignored, however, is sexual violence during times of armed conflict. This paper examines the nature and dynamics of sexual violence as it occurred during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Drawing upon testimonies given to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), descriptions of rapes-both singular and mass-were qualitatively analysed. In general, three broad types of assaults were identified: opportunistic assaults, which seemed to be a product of the disorder inherent within the conflict; episodes of sexual enslavement; and genocidal rapes, which were framed by the broader genocidal endeavours occurring at the time."
"October 26, 2009","This article explores community-based restorative justice projects run by political ex-prisoners and former combatants in Northern Ireland, initiatives which are dealing with everyday crime and conflict in local communities in a period of transition. It is argued that restorative justice can act as a facilitator, both for individuals within the community and between communities and the state, when violence-supporting norms are expected to be replaced by nonviolent approaches to conflict and its resolution. The article also argues for a greater role for criminological approaches to crime, punishment and justice within transitions, recognising the strengths of criminology to address underlying causes of continued violence in postconflict settings. In particular, this article investigates attempts by these initiatives to build bridges between historically estranged communities and the police, and argues for the possibility of restorative justice becoming a catalyst for transformative justice during times of rapid social change."
"October 26, 2009","The article argues that the principle of sovereignty is being ousted from its position as a Letztbegründung (first principle) of international law. This trend is welcome. Sovereignty must and can be justified. The normative value of sovereignty is derived from and geared towards humanity that is the legal principle that human rights, interests, needs, and security must be respected and promoted. State sovereignty is not merely limited by human rights, but should be seen to exist only in function of humanity. It has thus been humanized. Consequently, conflicts between state sovereignty and human rights should not be approached in a balancing process in which the former is played off against the latter on an equal footing, but should be tackled on the basis of a presumption in favour of humanity. A humanized state sovereignty implies responsibility for the protection of basic human rights and the state's accountability. The humanization of sovereignty also suggests a reassessment of humanitarian intervention. In contrast to sovereignty, non-intervention is constitutive for the international legal order and must be upheld as a rule. Moreover, the independent principles of human rights protection and self-determination constitute additional shields against unilateral interventions. But when human rights, needs, and interests are acknowledged as the systematic and doctrinal point of departure of the legal argument, the focus is shifted from states’ rights to states’ obligations towards natural persons. A state which grossly and manifestly fails to discharge these duties has its sovereignty suspended. Starting off from human needs leads, in a system of multilevel governance and under the principle of solidarity, to a fall-back responsibility of the international community, acting through the Security Council, for safeguarding humanity. In that perspective, the Council has under very strict conditions the duty to authorize proportionate humanitarian action to prevent or combat genocide or massive and widespread crimes against humanity. The exercise of the veto by a permanent member in such a situation should be considered illegal or abusive. The ongoing process of a humanization of sovereignty is a cornerstone of the current transformation of international law into an individual-centred system."
"October 26, 2009","This article analyses the potential of the WTO waiver as a legal instrument to reconcile conflicting norms and interests. It is argued that conflicts between WTO law and other international legal regimes are often an expression of underlying conflicts of interest and that these should be addressed in political processes. The article proposes that the waiver process has the potential to become a forum for political debate which is open not only to economic interests, but also to other public interests and perspectives. The waiver decision which concludes such a process can provide a solution to conflicts of interest either by modifying the existing rules of WTO law or by limiting the WTO's jurisdiction in favour of another international legal regime. These theses are explored with reference to the TRIPS and Kimberley waiver decisions."
"October 24, 2009","The conflict in the South of Thailand has received increasing international attention due to the violent nature of the struggle and the Muslim identity of the insurgency. This paper deals with the discursive struggle over the nature of the conflict. Two main interpretations of the conflict can be identified namely the religious interpretation and the “national‐liberation” explanation. Neither interpretation explains the conflict in its entirety however each emphasizes a given factor in the conflict over others. Rather than taking the usual stand of the West vs. the Rest this paper will show how the security establishment (both regional and global) has favored the religious interpretation while a large portion of the non‐western academic community in addition to most non‐governmental organizations have favored the second explanation. The paper concludes that the divergent explanations rather than representing a division between the West and the Rest, show that the division cuts across geographical lines and in some instances can be traced to the instrumental use of the discourse of the “War on Terror” in the service of national interest and hegemonic security concerns."
"October 23, 2009","Societies are sometimes divided into groups that behave in different ways or have strongly opposing opinions. At other times, everyone seems to behave according to similar principles and opinions. It is likely that individual decisions on behavior or opinions are affected by social networks through influence and selection processes. However, the outcomes are not necessarily optimal for the society as a whole. Two types of problems might arise: (a) polarization of the society into two camps that do not reach consensus, possibly leading to conflict; (b) actors choosing suboptimal behavior, because changing behavior is too risky if done unilaterally. Simulations show that if a society is rather segregated initially, there exists a heightened probability that this situation will worsen. The effect of network density is twofold. First, density has a positive effect on reaching a uniform opinion and, therefore, decreases the likelihood of polarization. Second, density increases the likelihood that actors do not change their behavior, worsening the inefficiency of already suboptimal initial situations."
"October 22, 2009","This article develops an approach for the empirical study of the news media’s impact on the conflict that it covers. While mass communications research has studied how the news media covers conflict, it has not taken the next step of assessing the impact of that coverage.  This article contends that such an inquiry is necessarily an inter-disciplinary task, and joins conflict theory with mass communications research to identify the kinds of questions that may be empirically tested to determine whether the news media is having a constructive or destructive effect on the conflict that it covers."
"October 21, 2009","During the Indonesian president election process, the coalition of parties could be shown as the dominant process beside the president campaign. The coalition could be regarded as the emergence of the parties’ preferential coherence based upon the interest and attributes of each party. The similarity and difference of parties’ preference and attributes could be depicted through of party elites’ opinions and attitude toward flowered political issues. In this paper, we use the Heider’s balance theory to construct relation network among parties by using the longitudinal news data of the party elite’s opinion that published by the media, and then analyze the dynamic of coalition formation in the Indonesian political system during the election process. We have shown that the balance of the party’s relational network move toward the larger balance index relative to the initial condition. This phenomenon has verified the structural balance hypothesis especially for the conflict situation such as the election process.  Interestingly, the balance of the system is fluctuated dynamically through time following certain trajectory. This dynamics is divided into 3 phases, that is, disorder state, conflict state, and order state, as well as signed the difference of party behavior before and after the legislative election. Moreover, we also analyzed the stability two parties’ relation in particular period in order to understand specifically the dynamic of the system in triadic level."
"October 21, 2009","Sinn Féin is the party most associated in public discourse with the term ‘republican’ in Ireland. It is also a party whose public rhetoric relies heavily on concepts at the core of the debates on contemporary civic republicanism. However, previous incarnations of the party have engaged in a static constitutionalism and an almost mythical idea of ‘the Republic’ and the party’s opponents view its rhetoric as skin deep – overlaying a more fundamental authoritarianism.  In addition the Irish peace process has required the party to modify it tactics and to some extent at least its aims. As Sinn Féin is experiencing a period of significant development and growth, in the aftermath of the Northern Ireland peace process these contradictory images of the party need to be analysed, with a view to contextualising the party within a broader comparative politics framework."
"October 20, 2009","Until quite recently, individuals were not able to challenge UN Security Council action at the international level, relying instead on member states in their attempts to obtain relief. This was true even when, for example, their assets were frozen or they were detained under Security Council authority. Within the last several years, however, the Security Council has allowed affected individuals to directly challenge its authority. After so many years of denying individuals standing, the Security Council’s about-face is deeply puzzling, as is the fact that these newly-minted individual rights lack accompanying individualized remedies.  This Article identifies this unnoticed but significant shift towards granting individuals standing in the sphere of international security, to theorize about the functions that individual standing mechanisms at the international level serve, and to examine the implications of those mechanisms. This Article uses signaling theory to explain the development of these individual standing mechanisms. It contends that when the Council exerts power in unprecedented ways over individuals, member states demand reassurance that the Council is acting as a good agent and according to its mandate.  The Council therefore wants to signal to member states in order to protect its credibility.  If we understand the beneficiaries of individual standing mechanisms to be the Council and member states, not individuals, then the absence of individual remedies at the international level no longer appears inconsistent.  In protecting their self-interest, however, both member states and the Council leverage the rhetoric of individual rights.  Regimes that grant individuals standing, allowing them to proceed without the intercession of member states, are the result.  My signaling argument thus brings together commonly opposing constructivist and realist explanations for change and generates a predictive hypothesis.  I predict that norm signaling and peer credibility will foster individual accountability rhetoric and mechanisms, but only up to the point of allowing individual complainants to challenge authority, and not to the point of compelling a guaranteed remedy.  Accordingly, international law must develop new tools to address the rights of individuals outside the nation-state.  This Article is particularly important as scholars and practitioners at both the domestic and international levels seek to balance concern for individual rights with concern for security and to understand and unpack the implications of binding action against individuals by the Council, especially after the European Court of Justice’s recent groundbreaking decision in the Kadi case."
"October 20, 2009","Von Neumann Morgenstern (NM) expected utility forms a part of the foundations of theoretical defence economics and the economic analysis of terrorism. NM expected utility maximisation can be used to derive important results with implications for government defence policies. However, the amount of light that it can shed on the selection of optimal decisions from a choice set when the choice set consists, for example, of possible combinations of attack methods (and the decision maker is a terroristic group) is limited. This paper builds on Phillips (2009) and enhances the NM expected utility analysis of terroristic behaviour by drawing on the fact that expected utility maximising behaviour in a setting where a terroristic group makes optimal decisions from a choice set containing combinations of attack methods can be analysed in terms of two moments (mean and variance) of the random payoffs associated with each attack method combination. The particular contribution of the analysis presented in this paper is the construction of an equilibrium relationship between the expected payoffs of attack method combinations and the risk associated with those payoffs. In essence, this is an equilibrium model of choice under uncertainty when the behaviour of interest is the selection by a terroristic group of an optimal decision from a choice set containing attack method combinations."
"October 19, 2009","The relationship between law and terrorism has re-emerged recently as a pressing issue in contemporary jurisprudence. Terrorism appears to take law to its limit, whilst the demands of counter-terrorism hold the cause of justice in contempt. At this point the case for engaging alternative intellectual approaches and resources is compelling. Ian Ward argues that through a closer appreciation of the ethical and aesthetical dimensions of terror, as well as the historical, political and cultural, we can better comprehend modern expressions and experiences of terrorism. For this reason, alongside juristic responses to modern expressions of terrorism, Law, Text, Terror examines a variety of supplementary literary texts as well as alternative intellectual approaches; from the drama of Euripides and Shakespeare, to the rhetoric and poetry of Burke and Shelley, the literary feminisms of Lessing and Rame, and the narrative existentialism of Conrad, Coetzee, Dostoevsky and DeLillo."
"October 18, 2009","For the past two decades northern Uganda experienced violent conflict between the Lord’s Resistant Army (LRA) and the government of Uganda. The reasons for the causes of the conflict and its persistence is not clearly explained, neither the means by which to resolve the conflict has been arrived to. Consequently, achieving sustainable peace in northern Uganda has been volatile and doubtful, a number of approaches have failed with the most recent one pending being the juba talks initiated in August, 2006. Reasons and factors behind the failure of these attempts have been consequently debated upon by the public, at levels of policy making and in academic circles resulting in a number of questions regarding the confidence of the people in the peace talks through out Uganda. This article seeks to critically scrutinize the causes of the conflict in relation to the Relative Deprivation Theory, consequences, geographical and international dimension and the approaches applied in attempt to achieve sustainable peace in northern Uganda."
"October 18, 2009","The differences between the causes of displacement in Africa and Asia from the European countries is that most of the Africa’s displacement are conflict based (political), which can be managed only if we avoid creating conflictual environments, whereas in Europe is basically natural disasters/calamities. This have influenced and informed how the government and international structures respond. Responses have been based on humanitarian principle or on a serous political agenda and geographical interests. In this hard economic time, responses have been slowed and reduced due to financial constraints from individual states and donor agencies in particular due to the economic crunch and the lack of political will."
"October 16, 2009","Statecraft is commonly defined as ""the art of leading a country,"" with emphasis placed on the political/diplomatic, military and economic aspects of the craft as it pertains to foreign policy. This article illustrates the role of science in the diplomatic aspects of statecraft through the contributions of Benjamin Franklin, as well as introduces the use of science as a discreet and individual element the discipline of Statecraft."
"October 16, 2009","Asia’s rise in the 21st century has propelled an important intellectual discourse: whether India or China is likely to dominate the region. Both the Asian giants are striving to pose as benign powers. Both India and China are engaging with the region diplomatically, thus trying to enhance their relations with the countries of Southeast Asia. It is being argued that Beijing, using non-military inducements, “has largely allayed Southeast Asian concerns that China poses a military or economic threat”. India, on the other hand, with its emphasis on its Look East Policy (LEP) is attempting to remain engaged with this part of the region since 1992. As the ‘two pagodas’ of economic powers grow, their position and foreign policy direction in the international system is bound to be debated. However, both India and China’s growing use of cultural diplomacy to collaborate with countries and regional organizations, is being seen as a triumph of diplomacy over military domination. This paper examines the cultural diplomacy initiatives that are being undertaken by the two countries to engage with Southeast Asia to promote their respective interests in the region."
"October 16, 2009","Ben Reilly (2000) states in his article titled “The Africanization of the South Pacific” in the Australian Journal of International Affairs that these are troubling times for Democracy in the South Pacific. In the last 3 decades the Pacific has seen a growing trend of political uncertainty and instability that has resulted in armed conflict and in political violence (Henderson and Watson, 2005). Of particular interest is the fact that the majority of the instability and uncertainty has been occurring within Melanesia."
"October 15, 2009","The year 2009 marked both the 20th anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Washington Treaty establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The 1989 revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe (beginning in Poland), which swept aside nearly 70 years of Soviet-style communism in Europe, have resulted in a regional stability which, with some critical exceptions, has come to be taken for granted. Certainly, the nature and the structures of security in Europe have been transformed. There has been a shift from a security based upon territorial defence, mutual security and military alliances to one that aspires to collective security, the institutionalization of security communities and an active global engagement. That is not to say that traditional military and security concepts are in any way redundant. Indeed, Europe has struggled — and continues to struggle — to reshape its military and defence capacity in such a way as will meet its contemporary security challenges. This process has also occurred within the context of an Atlantic Alliance that has weathered significant storms in recent years, not least in terms of contrasting approaches to meeting the threat seen to be posed by terrorist groups."
"October 15, 2009","Why Islamic tradition in Morocco and Indonesia is different? Why Islamic patterns in urban communities such as Jakarta different with Islamic patterns of rural communities? Variation in Islam is an interesting challenge to be answered. Islam, even in aspects substance, namely spirituality, is still a historical thing. The substance of Islam manifested and expressed in public life. When embodied in aspects of life, the manifestation and expression became a tradition. The model Islam as such is the accumulation of tradition, which in this paper called Islamic religiousity (keberislaman). With modeled Islam like this, this paper discusses the dynamics of Islam in the context of social justice and poverty. Will be shown how the Muslim experience of cultural evolution, from simple becomes complex. The conclusion of this paper is that variation is a result of Islam of cultural evolution."
"October 15, 2009","A notable feature of post-World War II civil wars is their very long average duration. We provide a theory of the persistence of civil wars. The civilian government can successfully defeat rebellious factions only by creating a relatively strong army. In weakly-institutionalized polities this opens the way for excessive influence or coups by the military. Civilian governments whose rents are largely unaffected by civil wars then choose small and weak armies that are incapable of ending insurrections. Our framework also shows that when civilian governments need to take more decisive action against rebels, they may be forced to build over-sized armies, beyond the size necessary for fighting the insurrection, as a commitment to not reforming the military in the future."
"October 14, 2009","Anthropogenic climate change leads to localised stresses in the forms of coastal erosion, ice melt, infertile land, deteriorating water sources,etc. that threaten vulnerable socities without the capabilities of adaption and resilence. The Utter materialistic life-style in United States has emitted massive volume of greenhouse gases since a long time engendering a sharp declining tendency in rainfall and other calamities in its south-west spreading over a larger geo-climatic region including the retarded ecology of adjoining Mexico. The increasing frequency and economic losses from natural disasters along with decreasing agricultural prices is crucial in increasing poverty in Mexican rural economy.Obviously Mexico has a long history of tranborder migration. In the post 9/11 scenario, the fate of such wretched ‘humans’ depends largelyon the whims of the fanatic border patrol volunteers active in United States-Mexico border. The citizens of a bordered territory are entitled to fundamental rights which their fellow human beings, the irregular migrants, can never be provided.Normal practice of border vigil is not fully controlled by the state or elites.  The goal of border patrol activists is not to suspend the law, but rather  to  upheld it more vigorously and rectify neglect of the law to ensure the  return to a ‘‘normal’’ situation, as perceived by them. Ultimately this exceptional act tends to be routinized and perceived as normal. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change does not have any provision of protection  to numerous affected poor people of less developed world.Geneva Convention does not confer refugee status for environmental persecution. The victimised populations are forced to migrate to join the researve army of labour in foreign countries  and get entrapped in new conflicts and crises. An internationally agreed measure of ecological debt would clarify “over-polluting” countries’ contribution towards climate change-enforced human vulnerabilities."
"October 14, 2009","Military intervention to bring about lasting peace in a violent communal conflict fails or even backfires far more often than it succeeds. Policymakers and military officials commonly ignore the characteristics that distinguish communal from ideological conflict, even though those characteristics greatly affect an intervention’s requirements and effectiveness. The United States in general seeks to avoid involvement in communal civil wars, and policymakers are not accustomed to thinking outside the box about how military intervention can be used. Yet despite the preference of both military and political leaders for avoiding such disputes, they may not have the luxury of noninvolvement. Thus they must consider a range of military options. This article tries to further this process by exploring problems with the current approach and identifying six strategies for military intervention in violent communal conflicts. Specific missions worth examining include limiting intervention to providing humanitarian relief to refugees; quarantining the conflict to prevent it from spreading; serving as an arsenal to create a local balance of power; militarily supporting one side to help it win a complete victory; transferring populations to reduce hostile ethnic commingling; and deploying troops before a conflict begins in order to reduce local fears. All these forms of intervention have limited effectiveness and some are politically demanding. If the United States cannot meet the requirements of these missions and live within their limits, however, it should not intervene."
"October 14, 2009","Military intervention without a reasonable prospect of success is unjustifiable, especially when it is done in the name of humanity. Couched in the debate on the responsibility to protect civilians from violence and drawing on traditional ‘just war’ principles, the central premise of this book is that humanitarian military intervention can be justified as a policy option only if decision makers can be reasonably sure that intervention will do more good than harm. The book asks, ‘Have past humanitarian military interventions been successful?’. It defines success as saving lives and sets out a methodology for estimating the number of lives saved by a particular military intervention. Analysis of 17 military operations in six conflict areas that were the defining cases of the 1990s — northern Iraq after the Gulf War, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor — shows that past interventions helped to save lives more often than not. In every conflict studied, however, some military interventions succeeded while others failed, raising the question, ‘Why have some past interventions been more successful than others?’ The book argues the central factors determining whether a humanitarian intervention succeeds are the objectives of the intervention and the military strategy employed by the intervening states. Four types of humanitarian military intervention are offered: providing logistical assistance, protecting aid operations, protecting the population and defeating the perpetrators of violence.  The focus on strategy within these four types allows an exploration of the political and military dimensions of humanitarian intervention and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each of the four types. Humanitarian military intervention is controversial. Scepticism is always in order about the need to use military force because the consequences can be so dire. Yet it has become equally controversial for a government to subject its citizens to massive violation of their basic human rights. This book recognizes the limits of humanitarian intervention but does not shy away from suggesting how use military force to save lives in extreme circumstances."
"October 13, 2009","This article suggests a new explanation for the growth of polarization in U.S. public policy disputes - the increasing tendency for disagreements over policy (as distinguished from elections) to escalate to the point that competing groups talk past each other, unwilling (or unable) to listen or to concede that “They” might have a point."
"October 13, 2009","This article develops a general theory of why post-disaster ‘lessons learned’ documents are often ‘fantasy documents’. The article describes the political and organizational barriers to effective learning from disasters, and builds on general theory building on learning from extreme events to explain this phenomenon. Fantasy documents are not generally about the ‘real’ causes and solutions to disasters; rather, they are generated to prove that some authoritative actor has ‘done something’ about a disaster. Because it is difficult to test whether learning happened after an extreme event, these post-disaster documents are generally ignored after they are published."
"October 13, 2009","This article takes an interest in the effects of buzzwords in the lesson-drawing efforts of governmental bureaucracy. Buzzwords are viewed here as policy ideas for which policy makers are enthusiastic beyond subjecting them to critical scrutiny. They are in that sense detrimental to policy-oriented learning and lesson-drawing in the long run. They can, however, serve as heuristic devices in the short run; the reason for their usage and spreading may be that they pinpoint recurring structural problems (however, not solutions). This argument is corroborated by a case study on the effects of the buzzword ‘shared situation awareness’, which has been overly tractable in the Swedish crisis management system for a number of years."
"October 13, 2009","The concept of protection of civilians in armed conflict and the respective roles of peace operations and other actors have not been conclusively defined. This article considers the Secretary General's latest reports on protection, in particular the two most recent ones (29 May 2009 and 28 October 2007). The author argues that the understanding of effective protection strategies should be informed by a diagnosis of the warring parties' motivations to use deliberate violence against civilians. Analyzing why humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law are disregarded in many conflicts can help to improve protection strategies. An analysis of the warring parties' motivations may also caution against the belief that there is a system out there that can always protect people in ongoing conflict if only humanitarian actors would improve their modus operandi. Consequently, this article suggests that the notion of protection should remain in close touch with the idea of immediate basic safety. The author recommends that the Secretary General should insist in future statements and reports that a sound approach to protection requires a diagnosis of why fighting parties choose to attack and threaten civilians. If the diagnosis shows that the armed parties have incentives to disregard basic legal norms and morals; the SC needs to demonstrate real political will to give the concept of protection the meaning it has in conventional language or in the alternative, honestly avoid using it."
"October 13, 2009","The continuing failure of organizations to learn from crisis has many costs, social, political, financial and individual and may be attributable to a misunderstanding of learning processes. This paper maps out contributions to learning from crisis from a number of fields. Central to the paper's argument is that the separation of policy development from practice, in theory and action, has contributed to a failure to learn. The paper considers two cases where the failure of child protection services resulted in the deaths of the children concerned. These two cases, separated by seven years, were connected by the failure of the same local authorities and agencies. The paper concludes with a number of observations concerning the public inquiry process."
"October 13, 2009","The paper argues that United States (US) post-war strategy to dominate and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries has continued to be the core of its foreign policy today. While this is camouflaged with euphemisms like providing leadership for expansion of humanitarian values, national interest has been the foundation of its foreign policy. Wars were fought and political settlements were made in accordance with pragmatic principles of international relations. After the destruction of the World Trade Centre, USA unilaterally decided to attack Iraq and forge ties with several countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America in tune with its ‘global grand strategy’. Strategic objectives define commercial tie-ups, technology transfer, joint military exercises, space and high-tech cooperation with India. The moral bases of its values affirmed in public diplomacy are apparently in conflict with its national interest. However, reiterating these values has become convenient especially after the economic integration roped in many countries into the American fold. Concomitantly, reference to its foreign policy has become imperative for almost all countries in the world including those who were in the former Soviet Union. But in practice, the rules and norms attached by the US to such integration are interventionist, through soft and hard power approaches. The Obama Administration will not deviate from the ‘pragmatic internationalism’ put in place by his predecessor with necessary changes in order to maintain its primacy. That is the bottom line."

It will contrast that commitment with Ireland‘s ambivalence towards collective defence and will argue that the 'neutrality‘ debate in Ireland is premised upon a misunderstanding of collective security that has the potential to pose major policy challenges."
"October 11, 2009","The killing of five young Australian, New Zealander and British journalists at the village of Balibo during the Indonesian invasion of Portuguese Timor in 1975 has long been surrounded by controversy, obfuscation and intrigue. While many suspected that the journalists were deliberately killed by clandestine Indonesian military forces or proxy militias, for 35 years Indonesia has maintained that the journalists were collaterally killed in the crossfire of battle, or were active participants in hostilities. Despite numerous executive inquiries over 30 years, it was not until late 2007 that a judicial inquiry into their deaths was held in Sydney, which found that the journalists were wilfully killed by Indonesian forces, in circumstances likely amounting to war crimes. The Australian Federal Police is currently considering whether to prosecute and extradite Indonesian suspects, including a former government minister. This article picks up where the recent coronial inquest left off by examining whether the killings amounted to war crimes which can be prosecuted. In doing so, it investigates the complex nature of the conflict (international and non-international); the obligations of the parties (Indonesia, Portugal, Australia and non-state forces); the attribution of non-State conduct to Indonesia; the legal status and protection of journalists; universal jurisdiction for war crimes and Australia's 1957 implementing legislation (under which there has never been a prosecution); difficulties of evidence and inter-temporal law; immunities and non-justiciability; and prospects for extradition under a bilateral agreement between Australian and Indonesia."
"October 10, 2009","Journalists and war correspondents have long assumed a special importance in investigating and documenting war crimes and other human rights violations in armed conflict. In recent years, threats to the safety of journalists have proliferated. This article considers how international law protects journalists and media personnel and objects from violence. The examines the legal regimes applicable in international armed conflict, followed by non-international conflict, and finally violent situations (or public emergencies) beneath the level of armed conflict (such as low-level insurgency, terrorism or other domestic unrest). While the normative legal frameworks protecting journalists and media objects are well developed, the application of those norms raises complex interpretive issues which are examined in this article, while there remains the residual problem - common to humanitarian law as a whole - of securing enforcement and implementation of those norms."
"October 10, 2009","The Security Council’s failure to react when Israel initiated its third large-scale military incursion into southern Lebanon in July 2006 stands in contrast to the overall reform agenda towards a responsive and accountable Security Council. While the idea of ‘responsibility to protect’ increasingly gains recognition, the delay in reacting to this event demonstrated a setback contrary to legitimate expectations expressed by member states. This article uncovers the extent to which the international community has come to recognize the legal significance of the Security Council’s responsibility under the UN Charter, what legal implications the failure of reaction could entail, and what needs to be reformed to rectify the ‘responsibility deficit disorder’ of the Security Council. It is argued that the Security Council’s responsibility under Art. 24(1) carries growing legal significance, which requires reform of the 'attitude' and 'culture' of the Security Council towards conflict management by mainstreaming peacekeeping operations in its security policy"
"October 09, 2009","This article is interrogates the international law arguments articulated between the 1940s and 1980s by the influential Australian international law and jurisprudence scholar, Sir Julius Stone. In particular, it critically examines Stone’s views on key controversies which still resonate today: the right of self-determination of peoples in Palestine; the legality of foreign occupation of territory; the lawfulness of Israeli settlements in occupied territory; the applicability of the 1949 Geneva Conventions to occupied territory and to the conflict as a whole; the use of force against “terrorists”; and the legal position, rights and prospects of Palestinian refugees.  Many of Stone’s positions on critical international legal issues in the Israel/Palestine conflict stepped outside even generous zones of plausible or reasonable interpretations of the law, even on the law as it then often ambiguously stood, and certainly in hindsight. His casting the Jewish people as the only victims who mattered in that dispute fatally undermines the prospects for a just and equitable application, or creative adaptation, of international law to the Israel/Palestine dispute."
"October 09, 2009","This paper explores the role of culture in two important events in the history of the separatist struggle in the Muslim South of Thailand. The first event was the “gentlemen’s agreement” of 1943, promising Britain’s support for independence or annexation to British Malaya in exchange of military and intelligence support against the Japanese, between the traditional Melayu leadership and the British Colonial Office represented by the commander of the British forces in Malaya during World War II. Emic and etic explanations are provided from the point of view of the Melayu leadership and of the British. The second event that is discussed is more complex and involves Malaysia’s support for the separatist movement and subsequent negotiations during the 1980s between Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur leading to an agreement stipulating that Malaysia would cease aiding the separatist movement in exchange for Thailand’s support against the Communist Party of Malaya along the porous Thai-Malay border. Finally, a brief conclusion summarizes the importance of culture in the history of the separatist movement of Southern Thailand."
"October 08, 2009","Alarming predictions have been made about the potential for climate change to fuel war and other forms of violent or social conflict, particularly due to resource scarcities (including food, water and energy) driven by climate change. This article first charts the likely security risks arising from the effects of climate change, including traditional security threats (such as armed conflict) and non-conventional or ‘human security’ risks (particularly as regards access to resources – food, water, energy – that are essential to human dignity). The article then examines the spectrum of international law implications of the relationship between climate change and these forms of insecurity. While the spectre of ‘climate wars’ is fanciful, the effects of climate change are likely to stimulate domestic and global tensions and to aggravate other underlying causes of conflict. Conventional and human security problems will arise from distributional conflicts over scarce resources (food, water, energy, land and seas), disputes over maritime boundaries, competition in the polar regions, pressure upon public health infrastructure, changing migration patterns, potential for radicalisation, and systemic stresses upon weak States, economies and social orders. Such consequences do not inexorably lead to outbreaks of violence or political instability, but they may be contributing factors given the right constellation of conditions. With the processes of climate change already well underway, even the rapid conclusion of an effective post-Kyoto global climate change regime (such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade scheme) would not be sufficient to avert the security risks that are already in formation. It is vital, therefore, to consider the range of ways in which public international law can be marshalled to prevent, contain and remedy the consequent security threats. Problems of identifying relevant primary obligations and attendant problems of causation limit the utility of relying upon principles of State responsibility to confront climate-related security risks. More promising are the specialised branches of international law (such as environmental law and the law of the sea), some of which offer prospects for responding to the challenge and others which would require more radical refashioning. Engaging the specialised branches of international law enables a thicker, more systemic response to the security risks attending climate change and is likely to prove more effective than relying on singular institutions (such as the Security Council) or normative frameworks (such as a new global climate deal). The costs of modifying international law in these ways is undoubtedly less than the human and financial costs which will likely ensue from resource conflicts and sovereign competition aggravated by unmitigated climate change."
"October 08, 2009","We analyze decisions made by a group of terrorists and a target government in a zero-sum game in which the terrorists minimize, and the government maximizes, the expected utility of the median voter in the target country. The terrorists' strategy balances the probability and the severity of the attack while the government chooses the level of investment reducing the probability and/or mitigating the severity of attacks. We find that risk aversion affects the strategies of both the government and the terrorists, leading to more severe, less frequent attacks but not necessarily more counterterrorism expenditures."
"October 07, 2009","Within any given state or society, numerous factors can influence both relations among religious communities and relations between these communities and other institutions or value systems, including scientific communities, schools of economic or legal thought, and various ideological or political movements.  Though some of these factors obviously arise from within the beliefs and structures of the religions themselves, many arise from the history, political culture, and legal framework of the state or society in which a given religious community is situated. This paper discusses the potential role of law and the legal system in influencing these relations and addressing conflicts among these communities and institutions.  After explaining in general terms the relevance of a legal perspective to the assessment and resolution of such disagreements, the paper specifically examines characteristics of the constitutional framework and political culture of the United States that appear to prevent or minimize conflicts involving religious communities."
"October 07, 2009","During World War II, more than one-half million tons of bombs were dropped in aerial raids on German cities, destroying about one-third of the total housing stock nationwide. This paper provides causal evidence on long-term consequences of large-scale physical destruction on the educational attainment, health status and labor market outcomes of German children. I combine a unique dataset on city-level destruction in Germany caused by Allied Air Forces bombing during WWII with individual survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). My identification strategy exploits the plausibly exogenous city-by-cohort variation in the intensity of WWII destruction as a unique quasi-experiment. My findings suggest significant, long-lasting detrimental effects on the human capital formation, health and labor market outcomes of Germans who were at school-age during WWII. First, these children had 0.4 fewer years of schooling on average in adulthood, with those in the most hard-hit cities completing 1.2 fewer years. Second, these children were about half inches (one centimeter) shorter and had lower self-reported health satisfaction in adulthood. Third, their future labor market earnings decreased by 6% on average due to exposure to wartime physical destruction. These results survive using alternative samples and specifications, including controlling for migration. Moreover, a control experiment using older cohorts who were not school-aged during WWII reveals no significant city-specific cohort trends. An important channel for the effect of destruction on educational attainment appears to be the destruction of schools and the absence of teachers, whereas malnutrition and destruction of health facilities during WWII seem to be important for the estimated impact on health."
"October 07, 2009","The Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the hub of global geo-political, geo-economic and geo-strategic significance in the post-Cold War period. The rise of China and the resurgence of India will be the hallmark for the next 50 years. How this surge in power is accommodated by the incumbent powers like the United States and Japan, and how the new regional powers like China and India manage the power politics that emerge will be the key determinants of regional stability. This volume examines the national maritime doctrines as well as the nuclear weapons developments at sea of the four major powers in the Asia-Pacific, namely, China, India, Japan and the United States, to see if the evolving dynamic is a cooperative or a competitive one. In particular, the volume looks at the evolving paradigms of maritime transformation in strategy and technology; the emergent new maritime doctrines and evolving force postures in the naval orders of battle; the role and operations of nuclear navies in the Asia-Pacific; and the implications and impact of nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and sea-based missile defence responses in the region."
"October 06, 2009","Hong Kong is about to enforce its new Civil Procedure Rules on 2 April 2009. The Working Party of the Civil Justice Reform put forward a number of mediation related recommendations in its Interim Report in 2001. The Final Report of 2004 stated in section 29 six proposals, including mandatory mediation. However, out of these six proposals, three have been accepted. Mandatory mediation has not been supported at this stage. This article discusses the initial six proposals as well as final recommendations and will comment on the final provisions."
"October 06, 2009","This book explores the mediation systems of mainland China and Hong Kong. Although no mediation law currently exists in either system, there are various provisions and institutional rules referring to mediation. In order to understand the distinct legislative mediation approach in both systems, the historical development of mediation is examined. In addition, the involvement of the judiciary and the mediation areas of PRC and Hong Kong are covered. The author sets out the differences and similarities between the two systems and concludes that the one country, two systems principle also applies to PRC's and Hong Kong's mediation systems: one country, two mediation systems."
"October 05, 2009","For the past several years, Beijing has been attempting to “shape” the diplomatic and strategic environment in maritime Asia, projecting an image of itself as an innately trustworthy great power. As a part of this public relations campaign, Chinese leaders have retailed the story of Zheng He, the Ming Dynasty eunuch admiral who voyaged to destinations throughout the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean six centuries ago. They have touted the feats of Zheng He, who sojourned in maritime Asia without attempting military conquest, as a metaphor for China’s current peaceful ascent in the maritime domain. In doing so, Beijing hopes to convince key audiences in Southeast Asia and South Asia that it remains pacific in outlook - and thus can be counted on not to abuse the sea power it is amassing. An attractive vision of China, they hope, will avert the tendency of regional states to band together to balance Chinese power."
"October 05, 2009","The restoration of property rights after a conflict involves key legal policy decisions, such as using the domestic courts or creating ad hoc commissions, which determine the extent to which the interests of displaced persons are protected. In 1999, following the experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo undertook the difficult task of restoring possessions lost by the persons displaced as a consequence of the Kosovo conflict, as well as those of persons affected by the discriminatory laws and policies of the Milošević regime during the previous decade. This paper describes and evaluates comparatively the most important legal policy dilemmas (use of the domestic courts, types of claims addressed and remedies provided) involved in the process and examines how they were addressed by the international administration. In this sense, the paper evaluates the design of the first mass claims mechanism, the Housing and Property Directorate, an internationally run body competent for conflict related residential property claims, and the impact of this on the implementation of its mandate. The article then analyzes the legal policy dilemmas and the internal legislative turmoil that took place within the United Nations Mission in Kosovo during the transformation of the Housing and Property Directorate into the Kosovo Property Agency, a hybrid international/domestic body competent for the resolution of private agricultural and commercial property claims linked to the conflict. The authors aim to identify and understand lessons that may be used when designing future post-conflict property restitution mechanisms to ensure both fairness and efficiency. They argue that a better pre-design situation analysis, preferably at the ‘micro’ level, is needed to address the needs of the victims. The authors advocate for more comprehensive property rights protection regimes, which do not centre on the ‘return home’ policy and that take into account the interests of informal dwellers. They consider that more effective decision making is necessary at the policy level. A clearer understanding of the nature of mass claims mechanisms and of the need for procedural exclusion of the domestic judiciary in certain cases will help prevent future delays in justice and benefit the victims."
"October 02, 2009","Intelligence is critical to ensuring national security, especially with asymmetric threats making up most of the new challenges. Knowledge, rather than power, is the only weapon that can prevail in a complex and uncertain environment awash with asymmetric threats, some known, many currently unknown.This book shows how such a changing national security environment has had profound implications for the strategic intelligence requirements of states in the 21st century."
"September 30, 2009","In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the congruence between deliberative democracy and interest-based dispute resolution (or “IBDR”). To the IBDR community (of which I consider myself a part), these developments tell a larger story about IBDR’s social and political calling. Not satisfied with Owen Fiss’s famous critique of alternative dispute resolution as appropriate only for “quarrels between neighbors” and the like, IBDR theorists have sought to demonstrate the relevance of their discipline for broader questions about democratic citizenship and political design."
"September 28, 2009","This enquiry, based in part on three months of fieldwork conducted in Rwanda in the summer of 2000, seeks to integrate the perspectives and experiences of radio listeners with broader considerations about the study of the Rwandan genocide and mass atrocity more generally. Specifically, I will argue that the question of RTLM’s role in the genocide can be elucidated through three aspects: ideologically, it played on existing dominant discourses in Rwandan public life for the purposes of encouraging listeners to participate in the killings; performatively, the station’s animateurs skilfully exploited the possibilities of the medium to create a dynamic relationship with and among listeners; and finally, RTLM helped the Rwandan state appropriate one of the most innocuous aspects of everyday life in the service of the genocide. Taken together, these three aspects make radio a useful prism through which one can approach the question of mass participation in a genocide that was diffuse, routinized, and intimate in nature."

"September 27, 2009","The article comparatively investigates the role of religious actors in the democratization processes of five ‘young’ democracies from the Catholic, Protestant, Christian-Orthodox and Muslim world: West Germany after World War II (1945–1969), Georgia and Ukraine post-1987/9, Mali (post-1987), and Indonesia after 1998. The analysis provides an overview of the roles religious actors played in the erosion of authoritarian rule, the transition to democracy and subsequent democratic consolidation processes, as well as de-democratization processes. Our three paired comparisons, including one in-country comparison, show that the condition which most affected the role of religious actors in all three phases of democratic transitions was the de facto autonomy they enjoyed vis-a-vis the political regime as well as the organizational form these actors took. Their aims, means, and the political significance of their theology were highly dependent on the extent to which they benefited from de facto autonomy vis-a-vis the state."
"September 25, 2009","The scramble for oil and influence by the big powers in the Caspian Sea region has been likened to the Middle East in the 1920s. But in today’s Central Asia there is an even larger and more complex quagmire of competing interests. There are the big powers such as Russia, the EU, the US; the neighbours such as Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey; the Central Asian states and the most powerful players of all, the oil companies, competing in what we call “The New Great Game.”"
"September 23, 2009","In this paper we examine the claim that natural resources invite civil conflict, and challenge the main stylized facts in this literature. We find that the conventional measure of resource dependence is endogenous with respect to conflict, and that instrumenting for dependence implies that it is no longer significant in conflict regressions. Instead, it appears that conflict increases dependence on resource extraction (as a default sector). Moreover, resource abundance is associated with a reduced probability of the onset of war. These results are robust to a range of specifications and, considering the conflict channel, we conclude there is no reason to regard resources as a general curse to peace and development."
"September 23, 2009","The Indian society consists of various casts, creeds and faiths, and a society which has so much of variation in terms of ethnics; social conflicts are bound to happen. Differing sociological perspectives encourage contrasting views on various social subjects, which is why it is sometimes difficult to live together harmoniously. If we study Peter Kropotkin’s essay on Law and Authority, he has very brilliantly described two kinds of customs that exist in the society."
"September 21, 2009","Consistent with a dynamic constructivist approach to culture, we propose the negotiation context activates a different set of needs for U.S. and Japanese negotiators. While both U.S. and Japanese negotiators have needs to be logical and to uphold social norms, we propose that the effectiveness of influence strategies will be explained more by a need for logic in U.S. negotiations and a need to uphold social norms in Japanese negotiations. We test our hypotheses with a sample of 15 U.S. and 15 Japanese dyads that negotiated a conflict simulation. Results indicate that the interaction between a negotiator's use of influence and the partner's underlying needs in predicting how much value negotiators claim is distinct in the U.S. and the Japanese culture. Findings offer extensions to existing theory on culture and negotiation and implications for managers in cross-cultural negotiation and conflict settings."
"September 21, 2009","This article investigates the relationship between national politics and local violence in the aftermath of Kenya's 2007 election. Focusing on the Kibera slum, the article shows that while the area's ‘big man’ Raila Odinga at times appeared to have a strong hold over his constituents at the grassroots, patrimonialism and big man politics cannot provide a full explanation of the post-election violence. Instead, local socio-economic factors played a key role and lent the conflict its own specific dynamics. The article also shows that while Raila's strong patron-client relationship with Kibera residents has empowered him as a national politician, in his current role as Prime Minister this relationship restricts his political room for manoeuvre. Thus the focus on Raila's ‘big man’ status in Kibera illustrates the pressures faced by Kenyan politicians in mediating between their public roles and the demands of their constituents."
"September 20, 2009","The present study is the first to examine the balance of power among all the players who influence the adoption of structural reforms - politicians, regulators, and interest groups. Special attention is devoted to the effect of conflicts between regulators. Professional conflicts signal to politicians that there is a high level of risk in implementing a given reform, thereby weakening their confidence in it. Conflicts also benefit interest groups, increasing their effectiveness vis-à-vis politicians. Using a unique data set on 32 attempts to reform Israel’s financial market, I find that the greater the extent of conflicts among regulators and the greater the intensity of the opposition of interest groups, the lower the probability that a reform will be implemented. These conflicts, together with the strength of interest groups, have led to repeated attempts to introduce reforms, so that on average it has taken eleven years for a reform to be adopted."
"September 18, 2009","A notable feature of post-World War II civil wars is their very long average duration. We provide a theory of the persistence of civil wars. The civilian government can successfully defeat rebellious factions only by creating a relatively strong army. In weakly-institutionalized polities this opens the way for excessive influence or coups by the military. Civilian governments whose rents are largely unaffected by civil wars then choose small and weak armies that are incapable of ending insurrections. Our framework also shows that when civilian governments need to take more decisive action against rebels, they may be forced to build over-sized armies, beyond the size necessary for fighting the insurrection, as a commitment to not reforming the military in the future."
"September 15, 2009","This Article, written for a special issue of the Chicago Journal of International Law concerning great power politics, seeks to elucidate whether and how international law shapes modern diplomatic discourse and, in particular, how “great powers” use international legal arguments as part of their diplomatic strategies. I use one topic area — arguments over self-determination — and two cases — Kosovo and South Ossetia — to explore this relationship between the language of law and the practice of politics. I argue that  international law serves as both a vocabulary and a grammar for diplomacy. International law is a vocabulary in that it defines the words that can or cannot be used in diplomatic discourse, the terminology that is or is not acceptable. Similarly, international law provides a grammar for international relations by setting the rules by which words fit together — essentially, how ideas can be expressed. For example, “we will use our right to attack you” does not fit into the grammar of international law or international politics (barring some questionable readings by the Bush Administration). By cabining what can be said in international relations, international law defines norms, shapes expectations, sets the boundaries of what can be legitimized and, ultimately, can make it more or less likely that certain state actions will be successful. Section II of this Article briefly sets out the background of the Kosovar and South Ossetian conflicts. Section III is a quick primer on the evolution of the concept of self-determination and its at-times difficult coexistence with the concepts of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Section IV turns to the analysis of how legal argumentation was used by Russia, the US, and the EU in the cases of Kosovo and South Ossetia. Although I note the relative strengths and weaknesses of the arguments, I am less interested in who was right or wrong as opposed to what strategy was used (if any) in deploying the language of international law. I am especially interested in how Russia, in particular, has used the language of international law as a tool of public diplomacy in an attempt to spin the perceptions or “control the narratives” related to both Kosovo and South Ossetia. Finally, Section V considers how the rhetorical use of international legal argumentation goes beyond managing perceptions and can actually affect the evolution of the substance of international law."
"September 13, 2009","In a state of emergency, ordinary political life is suspended. To exit from a state of emergency by curing its causes or addressing its consequences is the 'target' constructed as being in the interest of everybody and as the end that everybody must pursue. In a state of emergency, no critique is acceptable, and there is no place for a loyal opposition. Everybody must be on board in pursuit of the target. The state of emergency thus is a desirable condition for power. It is a highly effective way to avoid opposition - perhaps the only effective way in a pluralist political scenario such as a parliamentary democracy or the unstructured global political arena. Thus, the state of emergency is a stabilizing political strategy, a true foundation of 'predatory capitalism,' which is how I define the realized form of the current system of global production. In turn, predatory capitalism requires and develops ideological apparatuses to sustain it. A state of emergency thus serves as false consciousness. A thick ideological layer constructs as in the interest of everybody what is in fact a project of domination of the powerful few over the powerless many. In this project, the law serves a double purpose as at the same time a coercive and an ideological apparatus of domination - a stick and a carrot. This essay explores current global developments in which general states of emergency are 'invented' or 'exaggerated' to sustain legal transformations that, while presented as being in the interest of everybody, cover projects of domination. From the perspective of the law, we will discuss three instances."
"September 13, 2009","The declaration of Independence of Kosovo in 2008 was met with mixed reactions from different factions of the international community. While the West welcomed the move, countries such as Russia and Serbia excoriated it as being against the basic tenants of International Law. The declaration of the independence of Kosovo has thrown up many unresolved issues in the realm of International Law. To resolve the issue of whether the population of Kosovo have the right of self determination, we need to answer certain preliminary queries such as whether the population of Kosovo can be regarded as ‘people’ for the purpose of self-determination, whether the secession of Kosovo is valid under existing International norms and whether the recognition of Kosovo’s independence by other States is necessary for its creation and proclamation of statehood.  The ever prevalent battle between those who espouse territorial integrity and non intervention and those who fiercely advocate the right of secession is an old one. This apparent contradiction in the sphere of international law has led to an ever changing nature of state behavior. Any argument adumbrating the legal position of Kosovo should take into consideration the present nature of such state behavior. The present day status of Kosovo, to a large extent, depends on the recognition of its statehood by the international community. Only forty eight states, till date, have recognized Kosovo as an independent country. The future of Kosovo would largely depend of the recognition of its independence by the very States with which it seeks to enter into relations."
"September 13, 2009","This paper reviews the codification of the international standard for the exploitation of the continental shelf, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  The “Law of the Sea” convention or treaty, this agreement entered into force in 1994 yet still has not been ratified by the United States, despite mounting pressure to do so.  Because of shifting climate conditions in the Arctic, new technologies for oil extraction, and increasing international demand that makes expensive extraction more viable, there has recently emerged a new “Scramble for the Arctic” as a USGS survey suggests that up to 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30% of its gas remain beneath the seabed.  We examine the current state of the Treaty in the United States, as well as the international challenges to US territorial interests in the context of seabed claims made by Russia, Canada, Denmark, and Norway.  As early adopters of UNCLOS have until May 2009 to submit claims and the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf rules on claims for extended territorial waters, the dispute is only likely to heat up.  The resolution of the Arctic Scramble also holds a precedent setting promise, as there is a similar pending crisis in Antarctica.  Will the involved nations observe the rule of international law, or will this be a 21st century neo-imperial echo to the Scramble for Africa?"
"September 12, 2009","This Comment will discuss the jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (“ICTY”) relating to the question of whether a combatant hors de combat  can be considered a victim of crimes against humanity. It will focus on the Appeals Judgment in the case of Prosecutor v. Martić as well as the ongoing appeal in the case of Prosecutor v. Mrkšić. Before the trials against Mrkšić and Martić, the ICTY had not been called upon to pronounce whether the notion of crimes against humanity can apply to crimes committed against victims who are not civilians. That question was recently answered by both the Trial Chamber in Mrkšić and the Appeals Chamber in Martić."
"September 11, 2009","This essay documents potential short and long-term consequences with respect to Bush Administration violations of the laws of war and human rights law. These can involve placing perpetrators and complicitors in harm’s way; mission failure; aid to the enemy; and deflation of U.S. authority, law, and power.  Unlawful responses to terrorism and a lawless executive branch do not serve U.S. national security interests."
"September 09, 2009","While the Nile riparian states are engaged in legal, political, and doctrinal wrangling pertaining to state sovereignty on the way to a basin-wide agreement over the equitable allocation of the common waters, each day brings a heavy but avertable cost on the lives, economic, security, and environmental well-being of the tenth of the African population that inhabits the Nile Basin. The riparian states of the Nile basin do not have any significant alternatives to the joint management and equitable utilization of the Nile waters. This paper seeks to identify some of the obstacles that hinder the process of treaty formation over the allocation of the Nile waters among the riparian states. It examines the role of some riparian states’ adherence to colonial treaties and the mindset created thereby, the culture of mistrust surrounding interstate interactions, doctrinal controversies, attitudes of the riparians towards the formation of a basin-wide treaty, and problems of good faith on the part of the riparian states. It argues that the success of the Nile Basin Initiative (“NBI”), and the resultant establishment of a legal and institutional mechanism for the eventual equitable and reasonable allocation of the Nile waters hinges on the removal of these obstacles."

"September 09, 2009","West Europe played a crucial role in the creation of Israel in the midst of the Arab world, thus sowing the seeds of a stubborn conflict that has defied resolution even after the passage of six decades. It nurtured and protected Israel throughout its infancy, often at the expense of the dispossessed Palestinians, and it was only in the late sixties that the US took over this role from West Europe."
"September 09, 2009","The rules of attribution under the international law of State Responsibility have been undergoing substantial developments in the past few decades. The direction of these developments has contributed to an abandoning of its core objectives - those which strive to extend accountability beyond its traditional frontiers. This trend is discussed in this work by being associated with the contemporary string of jurisprudential debates on the questions of agency and control, most topically reflected by the ICJ in Genocide in Bosnia that has declared the ICTY’s Tadic test for internationalisation of conflicts as insufficient to establish State responsibility. This assertion is hereby discussed and contextualized in light of the many facets of the law of State responsibility, and the problematic of the enforceability of international law due to its Westphalian structures. A leading question in this work is whether the present application of the rules of attribution is consistent with the objectives inbred by its foundational doctrines. It proceeds to observe whether the typology of the present applications of the rules, and the approaches espoused by international courts and tribunals are successful in addressing the growing ubiquity of extrastatal activities that challenges the utility and functionality of the present mechanisms of international humanitarian law. International legal sources and rules, primary and secondary, are fragmented and reclassified as they are applied to factual situations to which they seek to give adequate expression. It is this difference between will-based and justice-based understanding that challenges the legal legitimacy of the perceived restructuring of the law of State responsibility by the ICJ in Genocide in Bosnia. This judgment calls unremittingly for a review of the legal framework of the rules and confirms the need to harmonise its interpretative applications."
"September 09, 2009","A few days after the criminal attacks on the World Trade Center, President George W. Bush declared a metaphorical war on terror.  The word “war” was once again applied to a nebulous concept in hopes of rallying support to Bush’s plans. Had Bush declared war on “terrorism,” a noun that denotes physical acts of violence, the war would have remained attached to the material world.  By declaring war on “terror,” America’s enemy became ephemeral and eternal. Using Althusser's theory of ideology, this article demonstrates how the public rhetoric of terror created an “ideology of terror” that created support for Bush's invasion of Iraq and his 2004 Presidential campaign."
"September 08, 2009","This text is an examination of one of the gravest humanitarian crises in the modern world: Displacement in Colombia, and more precisely, forced displacement, a conflict caused by multiple circumstances, among them the permanent violation of human rights. The relation that exists between the internal conflict and territory generates forced displacement since one of the war tactics is occupation and domination of tactically important territories for movement and access to communication and development routes. In this way, armed groups can allay themselves with parts of the population and move about freely in order to gain territorial and economic control of some zones vital in the military confrontation."
"September 08, 2009","This article deals with the challenges faced by classic sovereignty within the international system, especially when it comes to human security. Human security, understood as comprehensive concept that goes beyond classical security, strengthens the idea of the individual as the main actor in international relations. It also puts individual security before state security. Likewise, the new actors that have risen within the international system weaken state governance unless a greater amount of state responsibility towards its citizens is shown. As such, human security has become an important idea in the XXIst century in order to achieve responsible governance. The article looks at the Colombian case."

"September 05, 2009","This study addresses the little understood relationship between educational attainment and public attitudes towards war in four predominantly Muslim countries contemplating war: Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey. The multivariate analysis using public opinion data suggests that the educational attainment of respondents has no statistically significant association with believing that war is necessary for obtaining justice. In a separate analysis, there is no statistically significant association between educational attainment and believing that U.N. approval is necessary before using military force to deal with an international threat. This study suggests that there is some validity to concerns raised by the U.K.’s Department for International Development and UNICEF that education may not be contributing to peaceful conflict resolution."
"September 05, 2009","Several studies have found democracies tend to win wars more often than non-democracies. However, these studies have had difficulty establishing a causal link between regime type and conflict outcome. Building on this potential for spuriousness, this article investigates one potential confounding factor in the study of military effectiveness. Using the HERO data set of battle characteristics and measures for civil society, this paper finds that there is support for the idea that societal structures can have large effects on the military unit. Weak ties, such as sports clubs and reading groups, serve to increase awareness of the greater community leading to solidarity and willingness to sacrifice for a cause. Strong ties of ethnic heterogeneity may allow for specialization in combat, reducing casualties, but inhibit solidarity which reduces the likelihood of overall victory. Civil society imparts numerous positive externalities, leading both to democratic structures and benefits to the fighting capabilities of individuals in that society. The implication of this study suggests that a vibrant civil society may be a driving force behind democracies’ military effectiveness and that social structure may be a greater factor in military effectiveness than regime type."
"September 04, 2009","We introduce the experimental vendetta game. Two groups of four players each interact over ten identical rounds. In each round each player decides whether or not to reduce the payoff of each member of the other group, at an own cost. Reducing payoffs entails no material benefit for either the player or his group and is motivated by nastiness. Over the rounds, however, players can use reductions to avenge earlier transgressions. Fear of retaliation keeps destruction rates low (13%). The introduction of a symbolic reward, however, trebles the frequency of hostile acts (40%)."
"September 03, 2009","[enter Abstract Body]As an alternative to the structural models that currently dominate the civil war literature, we propose an interactive model of onset based on Most and Starr’s (1989) reformulation of the ecological triad. Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), we identify 116 periods of low intensity, oppositional group violence short of civil war which constitutes a risk set of actual escalation opportunities. After examining variation in the state’s behavioral response to these escalation opportunities, a logistic regression model predicts, from 1 to 7 years in advance, which of these environments will produce a civil war. Our results provide several contributions to the civil war onset literature. First, we find that oppositional group violence is a widespread, constant, if not random, feature of state-society relations. Compared to strong states, weak states do not face any greater frequency or levels of oppositional group violence short of civil war. They may in fact experience less. Second, we find that most states facing oppositional group violence maintain respectable human rights conditions. A small minority of states respond with harsh repression and, almost without exception, civil war develops only where the state responds with harsh repressive violence. After controlling for the behavior of the state during actual opportunities for insurgencies to escalate, we find that state capacity, poverty and conditions favorable to irregular warfare have no explanatory power in predicting where civil wars will develop. Despite an abundance of low intensity armed struggles against a highly diverse group of regimes around the world, we find an extremely strong and robust regularity: where repression is low – insurgencies don’t grow."
"September 03, 2009","The premise of the Arab-Israeli “land for peace” process is that each side values what it will receive more than what it must surrender. The repeated failure of this process spanning decades reveals the shocking truth that this premise is erroneous. For the process to succeed the currency that the Arabs must bring to the table is the ability and willingness to pay for their sovereignty in the currency of vigorous enforcement of Israeli rights and privileges, something they are not willing to do. Why not? At present, the payoff to the Palestinian Arabs as a body of a state is simply not worth the price they must pay."
"September 03, 2009","Why do some secessions produce peace and order, while others lead to violence and instability? Related, why does conﬂict emerge in some regions and not in others? This essay challenges ﬁve prominent explanations and advances an alternative theory. The core argument rests upon a curvilinear conceptualization of ethno-territorial heterogeneity and emphasizes the role of external actors in the escalation and diffusion of internal conﬂicts. The South Caucasus offers an unrivaled laboratory for examining the rival logics. Georgia, in particular, possesses four ethnically deﬁned regions with serious secessionist potential: Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Javakheti and Kvemo-Kartli. The former two are virtually synonymous with ethnic secessionist conﬂict, while the latter two avoided large-scale violence. Drawing upon archival evidence, elite interviews, and district-level data collected in Georgia, the analysis evaluates the relative consistency of the various competing theoretical expectations with the empirical record. Controlling for factors which vary across states but remain largely constant within them, the article shows how external support, by increasing expectations of success, and competitive ethnic heterogeneity, by increasing fears of demographic extinction, and played crucial roles in the escalation of the conﬂicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Conversely, neighboring ethnic kin states and regional ethnic homogeneity, which many believe cause secessionism, actually mitigated separatist sentiments in two of Georgia’s other ethnic regions - Armenian Javakheti and Azeri Kvemo-Kartli."

"August 30, 2009","Oil-exporting states, or petrostates, engage in militarized interstate disputes (MIDS) at a much higher rate on average than non-petrostates. Why is this so? Further, what explains the variation among the petrostates in adopting aggressive foreign policies and engaging in MIDS on that basis? This paper investigates these questions by developing and testing a theory that proposes that when revolutionary governments come to power in petrostates, they have a higher propensity to launch MIDS than comparable non-petrostates. This theory is tested with statistical regression analysis using a new quantitative dataset that identifies revolutionary governments in the period 1946-2001. The results show that petro-revolutionary governments constitute a special threat to international peace and security. These findings challenge the conventional understanding of the link between oil and war, which views petrostates as the targets of international competition for resources."
"August 28, 2009","The political circumstances underlying the Military Coups that took place in Thailand and Honduras in September 19, 2006 and June 28, 2009 respectively show some important similarities. Both coups were undertaken by conservative elements in order to remove populist elected leaders from their posts. Moreover, in both cases the populist leaders enjoyed the support of the great majority of the rural population. Nevertheless this paper attempts to explain how different international and regional norms shaped the regional and international reactions to the two coups. In the case of the Thai Coup the norm of non-interference was upheld by the Association of Southeast Asian States as well as by the rest of the International Community while in the Honduran case the norm of “protection of democracy” and “the rule of law” were upheld by the Association of American States and the rest of the International Community. This paper argues that the international community and other regions should learn from the prompt and decisive response to the Coup in Honduras based on a normative shift away from sovereignty as an absolute right and towards sovereignty as responsibility."
"August 27, 2009","Conflict scholars have devoted considerable attention to the natural resource curse, and specifically to connections between natural resources, state weakness, and civil war. Many have posited a state weakness mechanism - that significant oil production causes state weakness, and state weakness consequently increases the likelihood of civil war onset. In this paper, I develop nonparametric methods for bounding mechanism-specific causal effects to show, using standard measures, that the state weakness mechanism does not exist in the short or medium term. In only two cases is there the possibility of a medium term effect, and the state weakness mechanism is unlikely to be operative even in these two cases. Furthermore, the methods introduced in this paper do not rely on assumptions about unmeasured confounders, so this result is robust to the consideration of other risk factors for civil war onset. The state weakness mechanism may still exist in the form of long term effects or an effect that reinforces pre-existing war and/or state weakness. However, the null hypothesis of no long-term and/or reinforcing effect cannot be rejected without the use of additional assumptions."
"August 26, 2009","In this paper, a two-fold strategy is carried out for gaining conceptual clarity in response to the question: What is terrorism? The first stage is to defend a broad working definition of terrorism that emphasizes the instrumental employment of terror or fear to obtain any number of possible ends. As proposed in this paper, Terrorism is an act or threat of violence to persons or property that elicits terror, fear, or anxiety regarding the security of human life or fundamental rights and that functions as an instrument to obtain further ends. This instrumentality relies upon either an explicit or implicit threat of separate acts of future violence. It is argued that such a functionalist approach to defining terrorism captures the core qualities that unite the broad family of both political and nonpolitical terrorist actions. At the same time, the proposed definition avoids the problems associated with other approaches that either focus upon the terrorist’s ‘unconventional’ tactics, or the ‘innocence’ of their targets, or their coercive intentions. The breadth of the proposed definition allows for the more nuanced typological analysis in the second stage.  The typology is primarily an analysis of the modes of terrorism’s instrumentality.  Thus, the broad phenomenon of terrorism is divided according to factors of targets, the degree of force employed, agency, and the geographic context of the action. It is only by drawing out the diverse types of terrorism that the projects of morally evaluating terrorism and formulating a just response to terrorism can take place in a concrete and meaningful way."

"August 26, 2009","We develop a theory of interstate conflict in which the degree of genealogical relatedness between populations has a positive effect on their conflict propensities because more closely related populations, on average, tend to interact more and develop more disputes over sets of common issues. We examine the empirical relationship between the occurrence of interstate conflicts and the degree of relatedness between countries, showing that populations that are genetically closer are more prone to go to war with each other, even after controlling for a wide set of measures of geographic distance and other factors that affect conflict, including measures of trade and democracy."
"August 25, 2009","Criminology and International Relations (IR) share a relatively wide vocabulary: political violence, crime, security, deterrence, war on terror, risk, human rights and freedom. Particularly in the case of the ‘war on terror’, similar concerns and conceptual tools have increasingly surfaced on both sides. Nonetheless, one debate-namely Carl Schmitt's theory of the exception and its uptake in IR-has travelled less well. This article argues that there is value in engaging with the IR debates on the exception. From the perspective of IR, the exception makes possible different insights about the dialectics between law and crime by unpacking the constitutive role of the politics of fear, the importance of the ‘international’ and the transformed relationship to the future. It also exposes the deteriorating effects of the ‘war on terror’ on justice, democracy and social transformation."
"August 25, 2009","The ‘war on terror’ has emerged as the principal conflict of our time, where ‘Islamic fanaticism’ is identified as the greatest threat to Western liberal democracies. Within the United Kingdom, and beyond, this political discourse has designated Muslims as the new ‘enemy within’-justifying the introduction of counter-terrorist legislation and facilitating the construction of Muslims as a ‘suspect community’. In this paper, we develop  notion of the ‘suspect community’ and evidence how Muslims have replaced the Irish as the main focus of the government's security agenda whilst also recognizing that some groups have been specifically targeted for state surveillance. We conclude that the categorization of Muslims as suspect may be serving to undermine national security rather than enhance it."
"August 25, 2009","The war on terror has seen the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan; the use of torture on detainees in Guantanamo Bay; extension of periods of detention without trial, and increased levels of surveillance and control in the United Kingdom and the United States. Although being fought in the name of justice and democracy, the war on terror seems to have brought about curbs on freedom to citizens of the Western democracies and brutality rather than justice to those who are designated enemies and suspects in the war. This article looks at aspects of the war on terror from the perspective of a concern to defend the ideal of justice. Under headings of justice and legality, the lesser evil, the threat to liberal values, and justice and the other, war and occupation, torture, curtailment of civil liberties and the extent to which we each have a responsibility to protect the rights of those who are not our fellow citizens and who do not appear to share our values and our commitments to rights and freedoms are discussed. Recent writings by Michael Walzer on just and unjust wars, Michael Ignatieff on the use of the lesser evil, Jacques Derrida on the rights of the stranger to hospitality and Drucilla Cornell on the need to defend our ideals at the time when we are most likely to forsake them are drawn upon to help examine the fate of and the prospects for justice in a time of terror."
"August 25, 2009","Research indicates that Islam is the fastest growing religion among prisoners in Western nations. In the United States, roughly 240,000 inmates have converted to the faith since the 9/11 attacks. According to federal law enforcement, Saudi-backed Wahhabi clerics have targeted these prisoners for terrorist recruitment. The present research examines this claim from several different perspectives. First, it reviews the literature on prisoner conversions to Islam and concludes that there are opposing viewpoints on the matter. One side of the debate takes an alarmist stance, arguing that prisons have become incubators for Islamic terrorism; the other side asserts that Islam plays a vital role in prisoner rehabilitation. Second, results of a two-year study of prisoner radicalization and terrorist recruitment in US prisons are reported. The motives for prisoner conversions to Islam are discussed along with the effects of conversion on inmate behaviour; the role played by gangs and charismatic leaders in radicalizing prisoners; and the social processes by which inmates move from radicalization to operational terrorism. Third, two case studies are presented. One involves a terrorist plot waged by a gang of Sunni prisoners at California's New Folsom Prison; the other looks at the inmate-led Islamic Studies Program at Old Folsom Prison, which has adopted a de-radicalization agenda. It is argued that inmate self-help programmes may do more than the state to prevent radicalization and terrorist recruitment behind bars."

We argue that, as in other civil wars, much of the violence is ‘dual-purpose’, simultaneously serving private and political goals, and that despite a decline in violence since 2007, the situation created by the overthrow of the previous dictatorship remains extremely dangerous."
"August 24, 2009","The Philippines and East Timor are two countries whose governments have integrated ex-insurgents into their regular armed forces and police. In the Philippines, the arrangement to integrate 5,000 rebels came out of the final peace agreement signed between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1996. The MNLF integrees were mixed into the regular police and military units deployed in conflict areas in Mindanao. The East Timorese case, on the other hand, involved the in-take of ex-Falintil combatants into the newly created state military within the framework of demobilization and disarmament. Previous studies on security sector reform point to the shortcomings in training and military organizational culture for units with ex-rebels in the ranks. Integration policy both as a peace strategy and a security sector reform initiative is problematized in view of the gender-blind assumptions behind it and differential economic benefits it confers. The politicized nature of the policy itself -- that is, the negotiations between international actors and local stakeholders over the decision to integrate, who to select and the concomitant consequences of this decision to security force composition and professionalism invite theorizing. This paper is based on a comparative research project funded by Toyota Foundation's Southeast Asian Regional Exchange Program, which examines and compares the policy behind the selection, training, placement and utilization of rebel-integrees into the East Timor Defense Force (FDTL) and the Philippine army to respond to internal security challenges. It probes how international actors (the United Nations, donors, third parties and neighbors), national/local political authorities and civil society representatives informed the policies. The gendered assumptions made by those who crafted the integration policy will also be looked at. In addition, the research will examine how identity markers (in the Philippine case, religion; in East Timor, ethnicity) inform the ways in which the ex-rebels function inside the armed forces. The implication of the integration policy into the future prospects for peace in both countries will also be explored."
"August 23, 2009","This paper recognizes a positive relationship between education and ethnic violence among former British colonies and provides insight into whether this relationship is causal through case studies of Cyprus and Sri Lanka.  Both case studies provide evidence that colonial education did promote ethnic violence in each case either by socializing students to perceive ethnic differences, creating educational inequalities, or both."
"August 22, 2009","Immediately after the end of the second Global war in 1945, both the victorious and the vanquished countries realised the need and importance of an effective world organisation which can restore international peace and understanding. This Second World War proved itself to be much more destructive than the First World War because it witnessed a staggering death toll of 50 millions. Untied Nations began to reconstruct the past by assuring international justice. Since then, She tries her best to improve the strained relations between countries.Border conflicts are still on between many countries ie, Eritrea and Ethiopia over the question of Badme, India and Pakistan over the question of Kashmir, etc."
"August 22, 2009","Students of bargaining have long focused on the dual nature of international negotiations, which take place both internationally and domestically.  The prevailing wisdom is that under certain conditions political leaders can use domestic constraints to get a better deal at the negotiating table.  In this paper, I argue that under certain conditions leaders have an incentive to use ‘international constraints’ to pressure their domestic constituents into accepting a particular policy.  I apply this argument to the Serbian and Croatian cases of western pressure for cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Hague Tribunal)."
"August 21, 2009","This work intends to be a comprehensive reading of the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention)Act(UAPA) and the National Investigation AgencyAct,2008.It also contains the conditions in which such type of extraordinary law is created. For the sake of convenience, the work is divided into three distinct heads: I) Part I of the project has been drafted with an intent to introduce the reader with the conditions, atmosphere, environment in which the NIA Act,2008 was introduced, also contains some of the salient features of the Act .It also elaborates certain  provision, sections which makes this Act distinct from the prior Acts like POTA and TADA. II) Part II is the epicentre of this paper which is concerned with an analysis that due to the creation of the UA (P) Act and NIA Act there is a clear cut departure from some of the Basic principles of the Criminal Justice Administration System. This part also contains comparison between POTA, TADA&UAPA Bill and shows that since UAPA bill is almost similar to the prior acts which have only and only be repealed due to the political motivation of the political parties so it will create a danger in mind of becoming a draconian law like POTA and TADA. III) Part III concludes the project by summarising and recommendations how this act can be made successful & what steps should be taken for the smooth functioning of this act because by the introduction of such type of extraordinary law there is change in the  basic principles of criminal law and criminal justice administration system so some changes will be required in the functions/devices of the system."
"August 20, 2009","This paper examines the role of collective ideas regarding foreign and national security policy - or what I refer to as a “security consensus” - on the direction of U.S. alliance relations and domestic security policy in Asia. I argue that elite ideas and beliefs about the nature of the U.S. alliance in relation to a state’s national security strategy shape or constrain the policy choices made by U.S. alliance partners. To demonstrate that policy choices are more than mere reflections of actors’ preferences or strategic interests, I operationalize the security consensus along the dimensions of breadth and depth.  “Breadth” refers to the proportion of elites in the foreign policy and security establishment who support strong alliance ties to the U.S.  “Depth” refers to the security consensus embodied in domestic institutions and ideology.  Determining the breadth and depth of the security consensus helps us proximate the strength or weakness of the consensus, and the extent to which ideas matter in shaping policy outcomes."
"August 20, 2009","Does past win/loss record impact states subsequent choices of peaceful dispute resolution methods? We present a theory that portrays peaceful resolution of disputes as an effect of strategic forum shopping. During the process of decision making, each state strategically chooses between several forums; its final choice of a method is strongly based on the state’s past experience with this particular method. Empirical analysis of all attempts at peaceful resolution of territorial disputes from 1945-2003 shows that states use their record of victories and failures as an indicator of the probability of winning in a subsequent dispute. In general however, the link between past experience and choice of a resolution method follows different patterns for challenger and target states. For example, past win/loss record matters most for the challenger states that want to repeatedly resort to binding methods of peaceful resolution – arbitration and adjudication. Target states, on the other hand, place greatest trust in their experience with nonbinding third party methods."
"August 19, 2009","Why do some mediation episodes produce successful negotiated settlements between the disputants of international conflict while others fail to achieve success? This article examines how certain characteristics of a mediator, that is, a mediator’s information about the disputants and a mediator’s bias toward them, affect the success of mediation of international conflicts. By drawing a conceptual distinction between absolute and relative bias and measuring the type of information that is relevant for mediation success, I demonstrate that both the degree of bias a mediator holds toward the disputants and the degree of information a mediator has about the disputants are significant predictors of mediation success."
"August 19, 2009","Conflict between 'indigenes' of particular localities, and 'settlers' there, is widespread in Nigeria. Sometimes religious difference compounds the problem. This essay studies the indigene-settler tensions in Jos, the capital of Plateau State, which twice now, most recently in November 2008, have erupted into violent clashes claiming many hundreds of lives. The story of the 2008 outbreak is told against its background of ethnicity, religion, local history, local politics, the ambivalent state of Nigerian law on the subject of indigene rights, and, perhaps most harmfully and most intractably, corrupt and incompetent government. The conclusion suggests little hope for quick improvement."
"August 19, 2009","This study emphasizes that mediators may facilitate negotiated settlements by providing relevant information to the belligerents. Mediation can reduce uncertainty in the environment because mediators may have access to information regarding one or both of the disputing states’ costs of fighting and/or probability of winning that the disputants do not have about each other. The findings of this study demonstrate that information provision is an effective mediation strategy once we take into account a mediator’s ability to elicit relevant information about the disputants and the dependence between a mediator’s decision to mediate a given international crisis and the outcome of mediation."

"August 18, 2009","In these brief commentaries to the U.N. Genocide Convention, I explore three criminal law modes of liability as they apply to the international crime of genocide. Part I analyzes attempt to commit genocide and uncovers a basic tension over whether attempt refers to the genocide itself (the chapeau) or the underlying offense (such as killing). Part I concludes that the tension stems from the fact that the crime of genocide itself is already inchoate in nature, since the legal requirements for the crime do not require an actual, completed genocide, in the common-sense understanding of the term, but only a prohibited act with the intent of destroying the group in whole or in part. Part II explores the curious fate of both conspiracy and incitement to commit genocide under current international criminal law. Conspiracy to commit genocide was applied at the ad hoc tribunals but rejected by the drafters of the Rome Statute, thus leading to serious confusion over its status under customary law, while incitement to commit genocide is burdened by uncertainty over its inchoate status. Part III then concludes with a brief, speculative discussion of state responsibility for genocide for these modes of liability."
"August 18, 2009","It has been suggested that democratizing states are prone to civil wars. However, not all democratizing states experience domestic political violence. This paper investigates this puzzle. We argue that one of the key factors that “shelters” democratizing states from domestic political violence is the receipt of external democracy aid. States that receive democracy assistance are less likely to experience civil conflict than countries with no or little external democracy assistance. During democratic transitions, the central state weakens and uncertainty about future political commitments and promises increases. Democracy aid reduces the risk of conflict by bolstering state strength and reducing commitment problems and uncertainty. Using an instrumental variable approach that accounts for potential endogeneity problems, we find strong empirical support for our argument. We conclude that there is a potential path to democracy that ameliorates the perils of democratization and democracy assistance programs can play a significant positive role in this process."
"August 18, 2009","As part of the international fight against the financing of terrorism both the United Nations and the European Union have been adopting restrictive measures against natural and legal persons not directly related to the power structure of a state since 1999 and 2001 respectively. These ‘individual sanctions’, imposed both on EU citizens and third country nationals, typically consist of asset freezes and travel bans. The Union in particular adopts two types of sanctions: (1) individual sanctions implementing lists of terrorist suspects drawn up by the UN Sanctions Committee, 1 and (2) sanctions based on EU-managed lists (autonomous EU sanctions regime). Both types of European sanctions against individuals have triggered wide-spread concern amongst human rights lawyers. (3) The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe went as far as calling the practice ‘unworthy’ of an international body such as the EU. (4) Besides arguments that they infringe substantive rights, a majority agrees that they do not comply with the procedural rights guaranteed in the European legal order. In December 2006, five years after the autonomous sanctioning regime of the Union was introduced, the Court of First Instance (hereafter, CFI) annulled for the first time an EC Council decision declaring a legal entity a terrorist organisation and freezing its assets (case of OMPI). The Court found fault with the fact that those listed could not exercise their rights of the defence, that they were not even notified of their listing or informed of the underlying reasons, and that they could not exercise their right to an effective judicial remedy."
"August 18, 2009","The surprise terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001 marked the beginning of the war on terrorism. President Barak Obama’s closing of the Guantanamo Bay interrogation center along with other secret overseas detention centers on his second day in office is widely taken to be a step in the direction of ending the war phase of the struggle against terrorism as the defining threat in U.S. foreign policy. The March 2009 decision to stop using the phrase 'enemy combatant' marked yet another step in this direction. These two dates can also be used to mark the beginning and end of a period of highly visible and often contentious intelligence policy making that included a major reform of the intelligence community with the establishment of the position of Director of National Intelligence. During this period the intelligence community found itself on the political defensive accused of a wide variety of sins ranging from poor analysis to illegal and immoral activities. Intelligence was no longer the shield of the Republic but a villain; no longer a savior but a scapegoat. Its passing raises the question of what comes next.  Will the storm over intelligence pass or will intelligence operate in a permanently changed political landscape?"
"August 18, 2009","Through an analysis of the complex governance of security regulations, the interplay of public and private actors, and the effect of a lack of consensus on certain security measures, the paper demonstrates how the authority of a field of professionals may increase even during policy disputes. While traditional studies of security focus on state apparatuses of power and military force or policing, [author] contends that more and more security work is being done by new actors and agencies that do not conform to the old models. The AVSEC case in Europe and Canada confirms that security screening at airports is being performed by private actors according to security regulations being written by Transport Ministries. While quotidian, the management of aviation security touches international, regional, and national regulations, and reaches across public and private domains. Para-security agencies and actors are increasingly involved in public security work, like aviation security screening. Although government and industry desire an integration of risk management, the practical acceptance of the RM methodology is hampered by a completely lack of metrics for public security and risk. Salter examines how sector-wide standards circulate amongst a field of national, regional, international, public and private actors, even when there is tension between actors, the authority of the field to manage its object increases. The dispute between EU, Canadian, and US standards for the handling of liquids and hold baggage screening strengthen the shared assumptions, norms, and expertise of the AVSEC field."
"August 15, 2009","Why do countries ratify international treaties‘  To what extent is ratification contingent on the creation of agreements‘ To address these questions, this article examines the creation and ratification of regional nuclear weapon free zone (NWFZ) treaties, which prohibit the development, testing, deployment, and transit of nuclear weapons.  We argue that states establish NWFZs when they have little interest in the future development of nuclear weapons, since nonproliferation commitments are relatively cheap under such circumstances.  We also hypothesize that the actual terms of the treaty have little to do with ratification.  Countries ratify NWFZ treaties when their neighbors do so as a result of norm diffusion.  Statistical tests employing a Heckman probit selection model lend strong support to the hypotheses.  The findings help resolve a debate in the literature on treaty ratification and have important implications for research on selection effects and legalization.  They also suggest that NWFZ treaties can be viable nonproliferation tools, but only in regions where there is a relative absence of militarized conflict."
"August 14, 2009","Who speaks for Europe is a major question in European integration, yet few systematic attempts have been made to study when the Presidency or the High Representative represents the collectivity. This article shows that the size of the Presidency matters by means of two most-similar cases of conflict resolution. Large member states have more diplomatic resources and political experience. They are therefore less inclined to rely on the High Representative and his staff. The High Representative, on the other hand, has greater difficulty to compete with large member states for media attention and for third party recognition."
"August 14, 2009","This paper registers that peace building and conflict resolution in Africa has been a challenge and looks at mediation and conflict resolution from a different dimension. The paper argues that the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are the new hope for international peace and conflict resolution. It examines the causes of conflict in Africa and goes on to explore the challenges that the United Nations (UN) has faced in its attempt to resolve conflicts amicably. Finally, the paper outlines categorically some of the ideal strategies that the NGOs can use in their effort to resolve conflicts and build peace in Africa."
"August 13, 2009","Latin America has witnessed an undeniable increase in the importance of courts in policy debates, in debates about the rights of citizens and the duties of states, and in controversies across branches of government. This raises the question, whose rights and interests are these courts protecting? Are they perhaps newly empowered by the need to police a more democratic separation of powers? Who benefits from the increasing intervention of courts in politics? Are courts acting autonomously, or as agents of the executive, the legislature, or someone else? In this paper I propose a theoretical and conceptual scheme for explaining the capacity and inclination of courts to effectively police the separation of powers and enforce the rights of citizens. The framework takes into account both the institutional design of courts and their political context and seeks to explain which issues and whose interests the courts will protect with special solicitude. By way of illustrating its utility, I apply the scheme to the STF, the highest constitutional court in Brazil."

"August 13, 2009","How do domestic political conditions shape audience costs? We explore how three factors - the partisanship of the president, the reaction of other elites, and whether the president reveals that new information affected his decision - shape the ways in which citizens punish leaders for backing down in a crisis. We develop a non-partisan theory of audience costs that explains why partisanship will only have a minor influence on how citizens impose audience costs, stemming from the president’s unique informational advantage in the early days of a crisis. In the immediate aftermath of an international incident - the period in which citizens impose audience costs - citizens will look to national interests, not partisan ones, when evaluating leaders. Using a series of original survey experiments, we find strong support for our theoretical argument. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the role of partisanship, framing, and the audience costs literature more broadly."

The demographic change will become important factor to restrain arms rivalry in the region as the demand for social security as opposed to national security in China, Japan, and Korea rises fast and substantially."
"August 13, 2009","The concept that a state’s right to non-intervention is predicated on its responsibility to protect its population from harm has gained currency during the past decade.   The corollary, as stated in the 2005 UN world Summit Outcome Document, is when a state manifestly is failing to uphold its responsibility, other actors in the international system have a responsibility to take action in a timely and decisive manner.  According to the leaders of small states and academic critics, this challenge to the Westphalian notion of state sovereignty paves the way for more intervention by strong states in the internal affairs of weaker states.  This paper tests this critique against a realist alternative hypothesis that the decision to intervene depends on perceived threats to national interests, not on a feeling of responsibility for the population of another state. The initial findings support the realist argument that the responsibility to protect (R2P) concept does not lead to more third-party military intervention.  The constructivist argument that R2P dangerously encourages intervention is not supported. The data also show it is not true that most interventions are initiated by powerful countries against weak ones.  It is more common for weak countries to initiate military action against other weak countries.  Intervention was justified on the grounds of protecting civilians on a number of occasions in the post-cold war period. On most such occasions, the intervention was led by an international organization, not a selfish state.  Overall, these findings refute the arguments that R2P encourages military intervention and that interventions are undertaken mostly by powerful states that try to hide their political motives behind humanitarian rhetoric."
"August 13, 2009","In this paper, we look at how institutional differences across dictatorships affect the quality of the military intelligence that dictators receive from their subordinates. We argue that when dictators have a say in the selection of their elite advisory group, this lessens the caliber of intelligence and increases the likelihood that dictators will make foreign policy errors. We analyze this dynamic in personalist, military, and single-party dictatorships. We show that personalist dictators have a greater say in the selection of their advisory group than military or single-party dictators do and, as a result, are more likely to commit foreign policy blunders. We detail our argument using the case of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. We then test it quantitatively by looking at the likelihood that dictatorships will misread threats sent to them during inter-state disputes. We find positive support: personalist dictatorships exhibit more uncertainty in their responses to threats than do military or single-party dictatorships. When states provoke personalist dictatorships, they should not assume that they are dealing with a predictable and well-informed adversary."
"August 13, 2009","Since the late 1980s, the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a spiritualist rebel group with no clear political agenda, has abducted tens of thousands of children and adults to serve as porters and soldiers. Experience of forced conscription into the LRA is traumatic and varies in scope and intensity. Children and youth - some as young as 7 and 8 years old - have been forced to mutilate and kill civilians, including members of their own families and communities. In 1994, a group of parents of abducted children to establish the Gulu Support the Children Organization (GUSCO), a reception center in Gulu that provides medical care, counseling, and a number of other services. More than 20,000 children and youth have since passed through GUSCO and other reception centers throughout northern Uganda."
"August 13, 2009","When do leaders lose office because of their foreign policy decisions, and why? Many scholars argue that democratic leaders are substantially more likely to be ousted for their foreign policy performance than authoritarian leaders, rendering democracies more cautious in their foreign affairs. This paper questions the conventional wisdom, analyzing the accountability of authoritarian leaders in the wake of military defeat from 1919 to 1997. Based on a new dataset of authoritarian regime characteristics, I find that “constrained” authoritarians – authoritarian leaders who have not consolidated personal control of high appointments, and have not tampered with military institutions – are punished at relatively high rates after defeat in war, particularly when compared to their rates of ouster after victory or during peacetime. Intriguingly, however, unlike democratic leaders, constrained authoritarians tended to lose power after draws only slightly more often than after victories. These general patterns held whether the leaders initiated the war, or were targeted by other states. In contrast, “semi-” and “unconstrained” authoritarians appear remarkably resilient even in the face of defeat. Most of the few unconstrained authoritarians that did lose power after defeat were driven out by foreign forces after disastrous military performance. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the relationship between regime type, domestic accountability, and international conflict."
"August 13, 2009","In 1971, the United States and India came as close to war, or at least armed conflict. In that year, as East and West Pakistan, joined since the partition events of 1947, disintegrated into what is now Pakistan (West) and Bangladesh (East). India, caught between the two combatants, dealing with significant refugee influxes, and with a sizable Bengali minority, became militarily involved, supporting the breakaway Bangladesh against the militarily superior Pakistan. The Nixon Administration, rather than treat the situation as a regional problem, framed it in terms of global geopolitics (Kux, 1994). Pakistan, a ‘friend’ of the United States, was being “screwed [by] a friend of Russia’s” (Widmaier, 2005, p. 432). Seeking to intimidate India - and by proxy the Soviet Union - the Nixon Administration eventually sent the USS Enterprise and its attending Carrier Battle Group (CBG) to the Bay of Bengal. While military force was never brought to bear, the threat was certainly present, thus making the events of 1971 a rare ‘near miss’ - a situation where the use of force between democracies was a real possibility (Layne, 1994)."
"August 13, 2009","This paper examines three countries that have historically suffered conflict-ridden civil-military relations and are now governed by the democratic left: Argentina, Brazil and Chile. In Chile, the military has maintained its position on important issues such as defense funding. Brazil's military, of reduced influence in the 1990s, is reasserting itself over issues such as the Amazon and urban crime. This stands in stark contrast to Argentina, where the military has been antagonized by a government that limits funding and has increased prosecution of members of the former military government. What explains this marked variation?"
"August 13, 2009","How does security privatization affect democracies’ propensities to go to war, and to be victorious in war?  This paper seeks to answer this question, assessing both historical and contemporary cases of private security company employment by democratic states to trace the processes through which these firms impact conflict decisions.  I examine the case of the Hessians in the American Revolution – as a historical, grouped, profit-motivated predecessor to private security companies – in addition to the cases of Croatia in the 1990s and Iraq in more recent years.  In doing so, the paper aims to contribute to the literatures on the democratic peace and the democratic advantage, and highlights the potential for future trends in the private security industry to have a strong impact on both the practice and theory of democratic peace and war."
"August 13, 2009","Students of international relations have long argued that rapid shifts in relative power can lead to war. Fighting is rational, it is argued, when the declining state fears that the rising one will exploit its increased power once the shift has occurred. However, I demonstrate that this explanation is insufficient to explain war. Indeed, the rising state should be willing to alleviate the declining states concern by reducing its expected future power, such that a commitment problem never emerges. For example, states often limit their ability to launch preemptive attacks by withdrawing weapons (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis) or creating demilitarized zones; they abandon armament programs to avoid preventive wars (e.g., the Washington Naval Treaty); and they disarm to help bring about the trust necessary to end wars. By giving up today the attributes that will increase its power tomorrow, then, the rising state can credibly commit now to a future partition of the pie. Indeed, I show that war never occurs in equilibrium when countries can negotiate over the determinants of their power (their capabilities), no matter how fast relative power shifts. This result is robust to uncertainty about growth rates, and to any bargaining protocol in which war is an option. War occurs only when there are constraints on the players ability to change their relative power caused by: (i) indivisible or intangible capabilities and (ii) costs in relation to third parties."
"August 13, 2009","The passion with which both proponents and opponents of the US-Mexico border wall cling to their views is surprising given how little we actually know about when such walls are effective and what drives states to build them. Our goal in this preliminary study is to begin examining these questions. First, we elaborate the concept of “fortified boundaries,” which are asymmetrical, physical barriers for the purposes of border control.  These boundaries are more formidable in structure than conventional boundary lines but less robust than militarized boundaries.  The states that construct fortified boundaries tend to do so unilaterally, to prevent the flow of peoples or goods into their territory from a neighboring state that does not share parallel concerns."
"August 13, 2009","To uncover the relationship between bias and effective conflict resolution, we explore the bias of third parties and the techniques they employ in the management of river, maritime, and territorial claims.  We find that biased third parties are more likely than unbiased third parties to facilitate the weakest and least intrusive forms of conflict management.  Bias increases the likelihood that a third party will use unobtrusive techniques like good offices and decreases its propensity to facilitate involved mechanisms such as arbitration.  Additionally, bias is inversely related to the range of issues addressed at a settlement attempt.  As such, unbiased third parties are more effective because they are used for the management techniques that have the most potential to resolve conflicts."
"August 13, 2009","Can states successfully remove threats and advance their interests by overthrowing and replacing foreign governments? Under what conditions might foreign-imposed regime change (FIRC for short) prove more or less successful? The removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq has brought renewed attention to these questions, but the practice of FIRC is hardly a new phenomenon: there have been roughly ninety instances of FIRC since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and FIRC was a common occurrence during major conflicts of the past, such as the Peloponnesian, Thirty Years, and Napoleonic Wars. Although states have toppled foreign government relatively frequently - and the practice moved to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy during the Bush administration - the effects of this policy instrument are not well understood. This paper argues that the utility of FIRC for interveners depends heavily on two categories of variables: the goals it seeks to achieve and conditions in the target state. First, FIRC is most successful when it is least ambitious, notably when it seeks only to restore a ruler who has been overthrown by a domestic revolution or coup. Interventions that hope to obtain more extensive regime change goals - such as establishing reliable long-term control over strategic territory or democratization of the target - are less likely to succeed. Second, FIRC is more likely to endure and prove successful for interveners when target states are relatively wealthy, institutionally developed, ethnically homogeneous, and have been thoroughly defeated in war. Each of these factors reduces the likelihood of domestic opposition to regime change in the target and increases its capacity for self-governance."
"August 13, 2009","One of the important developments in international human rights politics since the mid to late 1970s and the early 1980s has been the increasingly strong focus on women’s human rights. Over the past 30 years or so, the international community has adopted international treaties and soft law instruments and established international institutions that focus specifically on promoting the human rights of women. One of the specific areas of focus in the international efforts to promote women’s rights is the prevention of (domestic) violence against women (VAW). Long considered to be a strictly private matter that lies beyond the realm of public policy, domestic violence is now an emerging area for global public policymaking. Since the early 1990s new international norms have developed that define domestic violence as a human rights violation and make it incumbent upon governments to take measures to prevent and respond to this social problem."
"August 13, 2009","This paper analyzes the conduct of a prototypical hearts-and-minds counterinsurgency (COIN) campaign as part of a project designed to explain theoretically and empirically under what conditions states succeed against armed, organized, persistent guerrilla challenges from within. This research into the British-led defeat of a nationalist-Communist insurgency in Dhofar, Oman, 1965-1976, draws on recently declassified government documents, the personal papers of participants, and interviews with British army officers who led the campaign. In Dhofar, the campaign included both military and political elements, as the conventional wisdom advocates, but the military component was by far the larger effort, and political accommodation was narrowly targeted and limited in scope. The conflict ended with the state’s military victory after a campaign of selective force wielded to meet political as well as military goals. Military success was made possible by narrowly targeted accommodations that left the sultanistic state unreformed. The military campaign focused on securing territory and cutting the insurgency’s lines of communication to its safe haven in Yemen. The army’s ability to take and hold territory was based on the co-optation of surrendered guerrillas formed into militias. These militias, the firqats, helped the state separate the insurgency from the populace and target insurgents militarily, and facilitated the provision of food, water, and medical care to the populace. This analysis includes a number of policy relevant findings: Successful COIN does not necessarily require good governance, political development, increased popular participation, or a strong state; security may need to precede development; military efforts, including the use of heavy firepower in civilian areas and force-on-force contact, may play a significant role in success; and building local militias requires special skills, a long-term commitment, and recognition of the militias’ strengths and weaknesses."
"August 13, 2009","Scholars have long been fascinated by the potential for leaders to engage in diversionary behavior, where leaders use militarized force abroad to distract their publics from various forms of domestic economic and political turmoil.  While there is some evidence that diversionary behavior depends on contextual factors such as regime type, opportunities to use force, and interstate rivalry, we do not know whether and how diversionary strategies are used by states to resolve contentious issues.  In fact, most diversionary studies compare the initiation of militarized disputes or crises to non-initiation cases, without considering the slew of interstate interactions in between these extremes, where states have an ongoing contested issue that gets managed with both peaceful and militarized conflict management tools.  In this paper, we extend theories of diversionary behavior to the context of issue claims, including competing claims to territory, maritime areas, and cross-border rivers as coded by the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) project.  Thinking about an ongoing issue claim as a potential diversionary opportunity, we examine the empirical effect of domestic turmoil on the militarization of issue claims.  We consider whether issue diversionary behavior is conditioned by the salience level of the issue, previous wars over the issue in question, and whether the disputing states are involved in a broader rivalry.  In a broad sample of directed dyad-years, we find that states are more likely to initiate militarized disputes if they are involved in contentious issues claims.  Using ICOW data, we also find that states involved in issue claims are more likely to initiate a militarized dispute if they have high levels of inflation and if they are contesting over highly salient and previously militarized issues.  This empirical application provides a new testing ground for diversionary behavior and shows how domestic turmoil influences the timing of coercive strategies for managing contentious interstate issues."
"August 13, 2009","Does the presence of a pro-government militia worsen the human rights of a country? Previous research in human rights suggests that when faced with armed threats and civil war, governments are more likely to engage in violations. When governments face being held accountable for their actions by withdrawal of public support or international trade and investment, they are more likely to exercise restraint. Democracy and international trade tend to reduce the likelihood of violations. Little attention has been paid to the question of how repression is organized and how the choice of agent influences human rights. We develop the logic of accountability and examine how delegation to more informal armed groups influences human rights violations."
"August 13, 2009","This study introduces a variable reflecting veto players into an international conflict model.  As our title suggests, the inclusion of this variable dissolves the standard measure of democracy which currently dominates the literature on the democratic peace.  Through the development of a new conceptual approach, and an empirical study strengthened by two methodological improvements, we provide an alternative explanation of peace than those which currently exist in the international conflict literature.  A cross-sectional, time-series dyadic data analysis during the period 1885 to 2001 shows that, while controlling for several standard conflict-related variables, the veto players variable outweighs the democracy variable in explaining the absence of interstate conflict."
"August 13, 2009","Why do some states emerging from civil war take significant strides toward democracy while others do not?  Why, for example, did Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Peru become more democratic after their civil wars ended, while Angola and Sri Lanka did not?  The small existing literature on this subject comes to several contradictory and puzzling findings.  This paper examines the determinants of postwar democratization in the short, medium, and long term by testing a number of often competing hypotheses with a dataset of all civil wars ending between 1945 and 1999.  Our findings refute some prominent hypotheses.  For example, we find that the outcome of the war has no bearing on the prospects for democratization; neither does war resumption affect regime developments, contrary to expectations.  On the other hand, we find, as expected, that economic development aids democratization while oil wealth hinders it.  We also find less democratization after wars fought over identity issues and in countries with higher prewar levels of democracy.  However, we find an unexpected relationship between ethnic fractionalization and democratization.  In general, while civil wars appear to provide opportunities for democratization in many places, the factors that determine whether a country becomes more or less democratic are much the same for post-civil war societies as for other societies."
"August 13, 2009","Why in some cases do we observe an increase in ethnic violence following a democratic transition, while in others violence dissipates?  We argue that a crucial intervening variable that is often ignored in ethnic conflict studies is the nature and number of organizations that purport to represent an ethnic group.  Following Brubaker (2004), we question the notion that ethnic groups are unitary actors with homogenous preferences.  In most cases, loyalties among politically relevant minority ethnic groups are divided between moderate and extremist organizations.  Democratization and concurrent institutional changes can significantly alter the previous configuration of organizations, which affects the level of competition between organizations for group support.  Through an analysis of six cases, we demonstrate that, on average, competition is associated with higher levels of ethnic violence while cooperative or dominant organizations have tended to reduce violence in the aftermath of democratization."

"August 13, 2009","This paper discusses six global demographic trends and their import for global security: (1) The demographic and economic weight of the advanced economies relative to the rest of the world will undergo a sharp and rapid decline; (2) a concentration of large, youthful populations will be on the move in an ‘arc of instability’ reaching from Southern Africa through the Middle East and south and southeast Asia;  (3) there will be rapid aging of European, North American, and East Asian societies;  (4) there will be increased pressures for immigration from Third World to First World countries; (5) there will be unprecedentedly rapid urbanization, especially in China and Africa; and (6) a concentration of adverse environmental impacts from climate change in the poorest and most populous countries."
"August 13, 2009","Within the general notion of biological WMDs is a weapon that has been least discussed - the potential genetic weapon.   Technologies that have been evolving from basic research into the molecular biology of genes and DNA/RNA are now providing us with the knowledge necessary to create new kinds of weapons that pose a strategic dilemma for the United States and its allies.   This project will investigate the strategic environment of genetic warfare - notably the notion of the human adaptation of natural disease events as applied to state and non-state conduct in the contest for political and economic power and influence.  Specifically, we seek to augment the security literature with regard to the conceptualization of the strategy which will hopefully provide deterrence and, if necessary, a successful defense against genetic weapons.  To accomplish this task, we must integrate the historical and current strategic doctrine of biological WMDs in American doctrine and thinking, and the evolving literature in genetic science and epidemiology.  An important finding in this analysis will be the growing importance of genetic forensic epidemiology is becoming a principle national security tool .  Furthermore, it will be established that the preeminent threat of biological warfare in the future - a more rational and lethal form of disease - one that threatens to nullify our decades old disease therapy model of vaccine development and deployment - is slowly leading futurist thinkers to resurrect Eugenics as a new model of science-based national security.  Specifically - the argument will made that human enhancement may be the only path toward a protected human population in a future world of radically new diseases.  Genetically enhanced pathogens - once posited - deconstructed - and placed within a genetic and political construct - can be combined with the growing logic of eugenics as suggested by Dr. James Watson, Dr. Francis Crick, and other aggressive utilitarian-oriented scientist/engineers who are leading these fields today.  The genetically enhanced pathogen can only be resisted and/or defeated by the genetically enhanced human being.  This sentence portrays the logic of a potential eugenics future - one that continues to arise from the combination of advancing genetic science and technology to the task of terrorism, warfare, and weaponology.  To this logic - we will seek to establish a formal ethical analysis and conclusion for the policy and scholarly community.  It is important to note that most of the thinking on biological war in the unclassified literature to date has occurred in the medical community.   There is advantage to this in that our medical scientists and physicians are the ones who will provide the basic research needed to generate technological solutions to such weapons.  Therefore, the research that we seek to conduct in this project is of clear importance.  The task of this research is to integrate the knowledge of how to defend against a range of international and national actors from the security literature with the knowledge from the medical and biological literature of how genetic weapons will work for/against those actors and the United States.   In this sense, the outcome of this research will be to establish a dialogue on the strategic environment of genetic warfare informed by the knowledge and corresponding technologies of molecular biology.  What is possible regarding the creation and use of genetic weapons will help to determine the corresponding political, economic, and technological strategies for defending against them.  Too - the ethical dimension of human genetic enhancement - as the direct operational juxtaposition to the empirical record of scientific work on pathogen genetic enhancement - causes us to write a formal statement about the specter of a renewed call for some form of eugenics - this time as a response to the need for the state to provide for the genetic security of the American population. "
"August 13, 2009","For more than a decade human security conceptualisations have been presented and discussed in international academic and political fora. The analytical usefulness of the notion of human security and its political appropriateness are frequently criticized, however. Our paper explores both aspects."
"August 13, 2009","How do countries behave towards international agreements they do not intend to comply with? Do they enter agreements and cheat or do they decline participation altogether? We address these questions by analyzing how countries pursuing nuclear weapons treat the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Why do some proliferators enter the NPT and cheat while others do not? We argue that democratic proliferators are less likely to join the NPT for a variety of theoretical reasons. A Heckman probit selection model designed to analyze the behavior of proliferators between 1968 and 2006 reveals that non-democratic proliferators are substantially more likely than democratic proliferators to make deceitful nonproliferation commitments. Armed conflict and strong nonproliferation norms increase the likelihood that states will disingenuously enter the NPT. High levels of industrial capacity reduce this probability. These findings enhance scholarly understanding of nuclear proliferation and generally underscore the value of disaggregating noncompliant behavior."
"August 13, 2009","Standard practice in IR conflict research segregates analyses of civil war from those of interstate war. This is reflected in fundamental research design issues (state-years as the units of analysis in civil war studies, dyad-years in interstate war studies) and also in the frequent assertions by researchers that civil wars are profoundly different from interstate wars. We recognize that civil and interstate wars may differ fundamentally in their causes, courses, and consequences. But since there is no pre-existing theoretical reason to anticipate these differences, it is probably the case that data availability (specifically the absence of data about rebels in most intrastate wars, and particularly about rebels during years of peace) causes the distinction between civil and interstate war studies. We discussion justifications for and against distinct analyses of civil and interstate wars. In the course of this discussion we show how the very claims used to justify separate analyses of civil from interstate wars can be used to justify separate analyses of “types” of interstate wars. We investigate the inferential consequences of making arbitrary distinctions among interstate wars. A second empirical section combines civil and interstate wars in unified analyses of war duration and outcome, looking for distinct patterns between the two types of war. We find in those analyses that variables representing the bargaining conditions across all wars account for a substantial amount of the variation in duration and settlement patterns between civil and interstate wars. We conclude that there is substantial evidence that the division of wars into civil and interstate categories is a distinction without a difference."
"August 13, 2009","The practice and process of diplomacy has been neglected in the IR literature for some time.  Much can be learned about the role of diplomats as agents in their own right through new constructivist methodologies and sociological approaches to IR.  This paper focuses on the empirical example of ambassadors to the European Union (EU) to illustrate how and why they have been able to push forward security integration, despite the reluctance of member-states to give up sovereignty in this area.  I argue that European diplomats comprise an epistemic community, or transnational knowledge-based network."
"August 13, 2009","Tibet has had a turbulent history and perhaps an even more turbulent historiography in the twentieth century. Following the victory of the Chinese Communists in 1949, the Tibetans were initially accommodated by the Chinese government, then repressed and then once again accommodated. Why did the Chinese government crack down on the Tibetan movement in 1959 and not earlier? Han antipathy, cultural differences, and self-determination claims were present long before 1959? What accounts for this variation in nation-building policies over time? I argue that shifts in patterns of external involvement and interstate relations accounts for the variation in nation-building policies in Tibet."
"August 13, 2009","Mass fear has been posited as the main emotional outcome of terror attacks.  Indeed, the term “terrorism” itself emphasizes that such attacks are meant to stoke fear.  Yet, a critical piece of the post-terror attack dynamic has been largely ignored: the public rage that comes in response to terror attacks.   Witness the call for politicians to step down after the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai or the placard reading “Nuke ‘Em Till They Glow” at the 2001 World Series.  It is the contention of this paper that, after a major terror attack has occurred, the public is more angry than fearful and that it desires revenge, not to cower and hide.  Moreover, government responses to terror attacks can better be explained through the lens of rage than through the lens of fear. The paper proves this point by evaluating outcomes from the U.S., U.K., Israel, India, and other cases.  It begins by establishing how public fears are normally stoked after terror attacks by analyzing opinion trends from these cases.  Then it moves into an analysis of the role of rage in both shaping opinion in the immediate aftermath of attacks and, in turn, pushing the actual policy responses to terror attacks on liberal democracies.  In the end it will be shown that rage and the concomitant desire for revenge that terrorist attacks ignite serve as better casual explanations for the policy responses that come in terrorism’s wake than does fear."
"August 13, 2009","During complex humanitarian emergencies, the relations between humanitarian NGOs and military organization vary widely, ranging from hostility to cooperation. In some cases, NGOs and military organizations define forms of coordination to avoid duplication, they cooperate and even launch joint projects. In others, however, even basic coordination has proven problematic, not to mention genuine cooperation. Why? The goal of this article is to explore empirically the challenges of these disputed boundaries and the ways in which humanitarian NGOs and military organizations face them in their areas of operation, during the course of their missions. Specifically, we challenge the two most common responses to the question of the source of coordination problems, namely their identity differences on the one hand, and the characteristics of the mission, particularly its ends and means, on the other. We make two arguments instead. First, irrespective of the ends and means and the threat level on the ground, domestic politics influence the propensity of NGOs and the military of the same country to cooperate. Second, the propensity of NGOs and the military to cooperate is also influenced by the ways in which each type of organization constructs the operational reality it is embedded in. Empirically, using fresh empirical evidence we explore the differences between French and Italian armies’ relations with French and Italian NGOs as well as their interactions with NGOs from other countries during the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan and the UNIFIL II mission in Lebanon in 2007-2008."
"August 13, 2009","This paper examines the threats and vulnerabilities of the emerging network of global food systems to characterize present challenges to food security. Over the past few decades, local, regional, and national food systems have increasingly become intertwined in an emerging global food network, a complex web of relations that include the production, harvest, processing, transport, and consumption of food. The emerging shape of this global food network does not map onto many of the traditional political science models of the world such as developed and developing countries. Today there are malnourished people in both developed and developing counties, and all over the globe there are pockets of both abundance and scarcity. This paper considers the impacts that changes that science, technology, and mobility have had on global food systems. In this paper, we explore food security, using the recent global food price crisis as an example of the complex, multi-causal, and networked based phenomena that are transforming the global security landscape by creating new sources of threat and vulnerability. The first section of the paper provides a definition of food security and considers the current and historical relevance of food to security. Next, we provide an overview of key disruptors, or unexpected destabilizing factors, of food security including malnutrition (which manifests as undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency as well as overweight and obesity) and food safety. In the paper’s fourth section, we review the rise of a global network of food systems and implications of this network for food security. The fifth section assesses the 2007-2008 global food price crisis.  Finally, the paper concludes with some thoughts on food security of in an age of transnational threats and converging crises."
"August 13, 2009","What are the determinants of FDI in post-conflict countries? In particular, what is the impact of foreign aid on FDI inflows? This paper contributes to the growing literature on the determinants of FDI by explaining how international aid is a signal that attracts FDI. Post-conflict situations are arguably the least attractive environment for FDI because of the effects of conflict on the economic system and on political institutions. Before investing in these countries, firms look at a variety of signals. We argue that the decision to send funds to a country signals the donors’ trust of local authorities. This signal shows investors which countries are trusted to handle international funds and commit to certain policies. What matters is the presence of aid, whether or not the aid has actually accomplished the goals set forth by donors. This effect of aid has not yet been addressed. Our findings also have a normative value: states that have recently experienced conflict are often likely to see a conflict reoccurrence – especially if their economic situation remains dire. Aid, and the FDI that it seems to attract through signaling, might help states escape the cycle of repeated wars."
"August 13, 2009","For nearly two decades, the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) has waged a war against the people of Northern Uganda. The group’s conflict with government forces has received little international attention, even though as many as 1.6 million civilians have been displaced and now languish in dozens of squalid camps throughout the countryside. In recent years, several researchers have conducted qualitative studies of the factors influencing peace and justice considerations in the north, primarily comprising interviews with Ugandan government officials, humanitarian workers, traditional and religious leaders, former LRA members, and others. These studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the challenges policymakers face in their efforts to end years of war. Yet most research has not included population-based data that represent the spectrum of attitudes and opinions of those most affected by the violence. This report seeks to fill that void."
"August 13, 2009","Occasionally the policy world creates a “natural experiment,” where a striking series of events creates dramatically different before-and-after conditions that can challenge existing understandings of political situations and relationships. The Canadian Forces (CF) who are engaged in operations in Afghanistan have recently undergone such a natural experiment, experiencing multiple major changes almost simultaneously. The keystone that cemented all these was the change in their primary location of deployment: the move from Kabul to Kandahar in August 2005. What had begun as a complex peace and stability operation, of the kind that seemed familiar to Canadians ever since the cold war ended in the early 1990s, morphed into a classic counterinsurgency operation, of a kind that Canada had not seen since the Boer War at the turn of the last century."
"August 13, 2009","The Philippines and East Timor are two countries whose governments have integrated ex-insurgents into their regular armed forces and police. In the Philippines, the arrangement to integrate 5,000 rebels came out of the final peace agreement signed between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1996. The MNLF integrees were mixed into the regular police and military units deployed in conflict areas in Mindanao. The East Timorese case, on the other hand, involved the in-take of ex-Falintil combatants into the newly created state military within the framework of demobilization and disarmament. Previous studies on security sector reform point to the shortcomings in training and military organizational culture for units with ex-rebels in the ranks. Integration policy both as a peace strategy and a security sector reform initiative is problematized in view of the gender-blind assumptions behind it and differential economic benefits it confers. The politicized nature of the policy itself--that is, the negotiations between international actors and local stakeholders over the decision to integrate, who to select and the concomitant consequences of this decision to security force composition and professionalism invite theorizing. This paper is based on a comparative research project funded by Toyota Foundation's Southeast Asian Regional Exchange Program, which examines and compares the policy behind the selection, training, placement and utilization of rebel-integrees into the East Timor Defense Force (FDTL) and the Philippine army to respond to internal security challenges. It probes how international actors (the United Nations, donors, third parties and neighbors), national/local political authorities and civil society representatives informed the policies. The gendered assumptions made by those who crafted the integration policy will also be looked at. In addition, the research will examine how identity markers (in the Philippine case, religion; in East Timor, ethnicity) inform the ways in which the ex-rebels function inside the armed forces. The implication of the integration policy into the future prospects for peace in both countries will also be explored."
"August 13, 2009","Sub-Saharan Africa is rarely seen as a significant actor in global security affairs. Yet since the late 1990s, more sub-Saharan African states have been sending more troops on more international missions than ever before. This article identifies the four main types of international military activity undertaken by sub-Saharan African states: interstate war and aggression, solidarity operations, regional peace operations, and UN operations. It highlights the core trends in each of these activities, thus underscoring both the importance and the complexity of sub-Saharan Africa's impact on international security."
"August 13, 2009","Most contemporary evolutionary biologists share the view that natural selection primarily concerns the differing inclusive fitness of genetic traits carried by individuals in a population. While biologists once also accepted the existence of group selection -- a process by which evolution regularly favors one entire population to another group of the same species -- such a process now is usually viewed as highly unlikely if not impossible. Among humans, however, the existence of language, culture, and socio-political competition between groups for limited resources creates situations not likely to arise in other mammals. Where human societies engage in direct competition, it is not as unusual as some might think that one group will annihilate the other by force. Even where that doesn't occur, a merger and fusion of groups can occur through the evolution of new cultural forms. Examples of the way ethnicity can result in challenges to a modern state as well as historical instances of group conflict are presented as evidence of something akin to group selection, These cases show that cultural transmission and history can lead to processes in human history that would be exceedingly rare if not impossible in species where transmissible social attributes need to be encoded to some degree in genes."
"August 13, 2009","Predicting social outcomes on the basis of numerous individual-level interactions is an exhaustive task that only a computer can complete.  Even a computer takes exponentially longer to compute all the interactions as the number of actors increases.  In addition, the measurement of relevant information (minimally, preferences, but often power and salience as well) becomes increasingly difficult as the number of actors gets larger. I propose a different way of thinking about these large number of interactions for bargaining in a single issue space by re-conceptualizing the interactions as between probability distributions at opposite ends of the issue area rather than between individuals.  The measurement of individual information is presumed to be a sample of the opposing distributions rather than a complete picture of all the relevant actors.  This sampling can be used to describe each opposing distribution.  Each  distribution is thought of as a heterogeneous group of individuals.  The density of the distribution at a given position represents the proportion of individuals desiring that position as their ideal position.  This presumes that all individuals at a given position would be similarly affected by bargaining.  The joint distribution of the two opposing distributions both summarizes the total ""society'' and provides the basis of a probability density function of prediction (rather than a point prediction).  Once the framework of this type of analysis is established, a particular model of distributional interaction is put forward to demonstrate how the framework can be used to generate dynamic predictions over time."
"August 13, 2009","Guerrillas frequently form governments for civilians living in areas they hold during civil war. The forms these governments take vary considerably. They present an underexploited area in comparative politics. Insurgents choose to form governments only when they think it will help them win their civil war. Civilian responses may alter their original design. In this paper I discuss which cases of guerrilla organization are appropriate for analysis, the different patterns of civilian governance, three brief case studies to demonstrate the variation, and a preliminary account of explanations for their differences. The explanations discussed here focus on doctrines adopted by guerrillas before rebellion, whether rebellion occurs as a result of predation or a security dilemma, differential access to wealth and the presence or absence of material resources available to guerrilla leaders. The variables discussed in the paper are represented in a template that is currently being used to build a dataset on civilian governance during civil wars conducted between 1945 and 2005."
"August 13, 2009","Social status is one of the most important motivators of human behavior, yet for over a generation international relations scholars largely ignored it. Over the past 35 years, no more than half dozen articles have appeared in top U.S. political science journals building on the proposition that the quest for status will affect patterns of inter-state behavior. As Lebow has noted, scholarly research in IR has been framed by overarching grand theories that foreground other motivations, primarily fear (security) and appetite (wealth). No middle range theory, no major research program, no major substantive debate has centered on issues of status. Over the same interval, however, research in all other social science disciplines and a variety of other sciences has continued to yield findings that lend compelling support to the importance of status in human affairs."
"August 13, 2009","This article investigates what ex-combatants perceive as possible avenues of political participation. Our knowledge of their behavior is sketchy at best today, and understanding their behavior is essential in order to understand the potential for democratic progress and peacebuilding in post-conflict societies, such as Liberia. This article describes when and how ex-combatants involve themselves in politics, using focus group interviews completed in 2008 with 88 ex-combatants of various factions and backgrounds in three counties of Liberia. It applies a problems and needs approach for measuring political participation. The results of this investigation demonstrate that common avenues of participation, such as demonstrating and voting are shunned or not thought of by the ex-combatants, whereas avenues that are contact intensive are favored, partly through extra-representational channels such as the radio or NGOs. The results are, however, very positive as ex-combatants, despite a sense of cynicism, envision several and varied forms of participation. While current choices do not endanger the peacebuilding process, they do indicate a lack of faith in current representational institutions which if it endures may be detrimental in the long term."
"August 13, 2009","Most of the literature on democratization in the Western Balkans focuses almost exclusively on the question of external democracy promotion and state building. Such an approach made a lot of sense in the years immediately preceding and following the Bosnian Dayton Peace Accord (1995) and the Ohrid Framework Agreement (2001) in Macedonia. However, one of the unanticipated side-effects of evaluating post-conflict institutional arrangements through the International Relations lenses has been the relative neglect of the work done by comparativists and area specialists. The purpose of this paper is to provide a more balanced perspective to the study of dilemmas of state building in the region by examining behaviour of local ethnic entrepreneurs rather than international representatives. Ultimately, the paper deals with several questions: first, what type of power sharing has been tried in Macedonia; second, whether certain institutional and electoral arrangements have been proved more successful in mitigating the conflict than the others; third, is power dividing approach, as developed by Philip G. Roeder and Donald Rothchild in their recent book Sustainable Peace on dilemmas of statebuilding in divided societies, an important alternative to power-sharing; and, finally, is ethnic federalism a “solution” to deep ethnic divisions or a part of the problem."
"August 13, 2009","When do armed groups choose to engage in or disengage from ethnic conflicts?  In this paper, I argue that variation in sources of funding (from donation or taxation) can help to explain the strategic decisions by armed groups to fight or not fight in ethnic conflicts.  I also argue that the inability of armed groups to distinguish among multiple opponent groups can allow groups that have an interest in greater violence to trigger spirals of ethnic violence.  I develop a formal model to develop the theory and examine case evidence from a Christian-Muslim conflict in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia to determine its plausibility."

"August 13, 2009","In some ethno-separatist wars rebel groups direct a large share of violence against members of their own ethnic community. But why do rebels target the co-ethnics they claim to represent in the war against the government? Our aim in this paper is to provide ingredients to a conceptual framework, which we assess using unique disaggregated casualty data on violence committed by the LTTE against co-ethnic Tamils in 1985-1988 in the territories in Sri Lanka claimed for the Tamil Eelam state. We propose that there are two processes of rebel violence that can be separated: violence against co-ethnic rivals, and violence against co-ethnic civilians. While the former aims at eliminating competition for leadership over the ethnic minority camp, the latter aims at controlling the population in areas contested by the government and the rebels. The intensity of violence directed against the two types of co-ethnic targets largely depends on the degree of ethnic homogeneity in a given area. The greater the ethnic homogeneity in favor of the ethnic minority, the more violence against rival groups and the less violence against civilians. Policy implications of our findings suggest that whereas a political response in the form of inclusive power sharing arrangements might be suitable in areas dominated by violence between rival groups, the protection of human security is probably a necessary response in areas where violence is directed against civilians."
"August 13, 2009","Does the presence of a peacekeeping force reduce violence against civilians during or after civil war?  Does it matter whether that peacekeeping force acts under the auspices of the United Nations (UN) or a regional security organization?  Are observer, traditional peacekeeping, multidimensional, and enforcement missions equally effective or does mandate affect levels of violence?  Much ink has been spilled on related questions in the peacekeeping literature, but almost all existing research has focused on whether peacekeeping operations (PKOs) help maintain peace after civil wars, concentrated on the resumption of civil war between factions, and either focused entirely on UN PKOs or conflated UN with non-UN-led operations."
"August 13, 2009","The purpose of this thesis is to research on the process how the interaction between the United States and South Korea during the Cold War period had formed Korean nationalism and how that Korean nationalism has been transformed  in the post Cold War period with the recent anti-American sentiment in Korea."
"August 13, 2009","This paper offers provide an analysis of one of the key shortcomings of the European Union’s (EU) counterterrorism efforts – the lack of a shared perception of the contemporary terrorist threat among EU Member States (MSs). Specifically, it advances the following five explanations. Firstly, history matters and when it comes to terrorism, different EU MSs have very different historical records. Secondly, while there is a general consensus in the expert community that Europe is nowadays not only a terrorist’s base and a potential target, but also a terrorist incubator, the exact nature and novelty of the terrorist threat, both external and “home-grown,” are still debated. Thirdly, demography matters and given the current immigration and natality patterns in EU’s MSs, it is bound to matter even more in the years to come. Fourthly, Eurobarometer public opinion polls reveal that the public perceptions of the terrorist threat vary across the EU and it is possible to identify a few specific explanations why this has been the case. Fifthly, the EU lacks a genuine baseline terrorist threat assessment which makes the development of a common terrorist threat perception rather difficult, if not impossible. Finally, it is important to note that while most European politicians and a majority of EU MSs’ citizens perceive terrorist threats differently, they at least tend to agree on a negative definition of (counter-)terrorism."
"August 13, 2009","Multidimensional peacekeeping operations have been central to United Nations efforts to end protracted internal conflicts and consolidate postwar peace. Recent empirical studies have shown that these operations are associated with prolonged peace after civil war. However, there have been few quantitative efforts to evaluate peacebuilding components such as economic rehabilitation, political development assistance, or human rights promotion integrated within peacekeeping operations. We use original data from a survey of the local population in Cote dIvoire and conflict event data to identify micro-effects of the United Nations Operations in Cote dIvoire (UNOCI). We find little to support the idea that UNOCIs deployments significantly affected the security situation, which had already improved tremendously prior to UNOCIs arrival, and we find only a suggestive association between feelings that insecurity would mar forthcoming elections and deployment patterns. We do find that UNOCIs presence was associated with less severe economic losses, and that penetration of electoral assistance activities was associated with more confidence in forthcoming elections. Finally, we do not find a clear association between deployments and the restoration of local authorities. Taken as they are, the results suggest the need to emend current theories of why peacekeeping works - perhaps de-emphasizing security aspects, and placing more emphasis on the economic and political programmatic aspects. While these results are preliminary, they suggest the potential of micro-level studies of intermediate peacebuilding outcomes to improve our understanding of how peacekeeping helps to build peace in war-torn societies"
"August 13, 2009","Recently, research in conflict management has seen growth. In part, this is due to the emergence of new datasets to study these phenomena, such as the Issue Correlates of War Project. However, this is also due in part to the connections that have been made between rationalist explanations for war and mechanisms in dispute resolution. Where scholars have demonstrated that third-party mediation can provide the mechanisms sufficient to avoid war, others are beginning to concentrate on the product of conflict management - the settlement - and asking why states select the particular fora they do when there are a number of overlapping institutions and actors capable of assisting states in dispute. One suggestion is that states  elect conflict resolution fora according to potential distributional gains and may forum shop in order to get the best outcome. This project begins to investigate this behavior in territorial, maritime and riparian disputes; examining what factors account for states' use of various negotiation settings: bilateral talks, state-led mediation, and IO-led adjudication. Results lend support to previous research that indicates that “tough” cases are more likely to seek third-party mediation of some kind, however, given certain distributional motivations, disputants may not be able to settle on fora that are noted to be more capable in resolving interstate disputes. In this respect, this research raises new questions about selection effects in conflict management and recommends more systematic analysis of potential forum shopping in international relations."
"August 13, 2009","Since the early 1990s, countries coming out of civil wars are the theatre of peace building and post-conflict reconstruction missions. Unlike traditional peacekeeping missions, these are operations where foreign military troops are used by outsiders to “control political outcomes.” The objectives are often laudable, “to create stable, tolerant, more liberal and democratic regimes out of the wreckage of war-torn societies” (Zisk Marten, 2004: 5). But is this liberal intervention in peacebuilding the panacea it purports to be?"
"August 13, 2009","Recent studies of the Mau Mau war in colonial Kenya have concentrated upon the use of torture by members of the British security forces against the Kikuyu population of the country's central highlands.  In such work, the violence of the conflict is thus depicted as either a top-down imposition on localities by the state or as a knee-jerk reaction by colonial subjects to that process.  Yet such an approach to violence ignores wholly the ability of individuals to shape local patterns of violence, which is commonly evidenced by the significant geographical variations in violence that typify the geography of irregular civil wars."
"August 13, 2009","This article discusses key conceptual and measurement issues raised by measures of state capacity in studies of civil conflict.  First, it reviews various competing definitions and measures of state capacity, focusing specifically on those that emphasize 1) military capacity, 2) bureaucratic administrative capacity, and 3) the quality and coherence of political institutions.  Second, it critically assesses these measures on the basis of construct validity.  Third, it compares quantitatively fifteen different operationalizations of state capacity, and finds the concept of state capacity to be three dimensional - though the dimensions do not map cleanly on to the theoretical categories - and suggests a multivariate approach to modeling state capacity based on bureaucratic quality and tax capacity."
"August 13, 2009","In this conceptual article we explore mechanisms of conflict management in European Union (EU) regulatory policy-making. We build on J.G. March’s distinction between aggregation and transformation as the two strategic options to deal with inconsistent preferences or identities that are at the source of social conflict. While this distinction is helpful in mapping conflict management mechanisms, the rigid association of these two options with the rival paradigms of rationalism and constructivism respectively has led political scientists to neglect conflict management strategies that work at the edges of aggregation and transformation. We show the potential of these latter strategies as intelligent ‘in-action’ hybrids that emerge from ground-level policy-making praxis of actors navigating a complex institutional and policy environment. Specifically, we discuss five strategies: issue-based aggregation, arena-based aggregation, (arena-shifting and arena-creation), socialization, re-framing, and proceduralization, their underlying mechanisms and related scope conditions. The theoretical implications of this discussion lead us towards ‘strategic constructivism’. In the most interesting conflict management mechanisms, norms and ideational structures matter, but they are related to strategic actors that draw on and orchestrate ‘ideas’ in pursuit of political goals."
"August 13, 2009","The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty entails high costs for non-nuclear countries and yet boasts near-complete worldwide membership. While nuclear weapons states are subject only to a nonspecific commitment to negotiate nuclear disarmament over time, non-nuclear members must relinquish their right to what is arguably the most powerful means to guarantee their security available. For most states, such institutionalized inequality is hardly a bargain. Why, then, have so many countries joined the NPT and done so relatively quickly? We argue that NPT leaders may have helped to reduce the costs of signing the NPT by providing alternative means of protecting members’ security – namely, enhanced access to conventional arms. In this paper, we ask whether NPT leaders offer informal inducements in the form of increased conventional arms transfers to NPT signatories as a valuable security side payment for regime membership. To explore this possibility, we conduct a statistical analysis of major conventional weapons transfers from the United States and Soviet Union/Russia from 1970 to 2001, as well as from the United Kingdom, France, and (West) Germany. We show that informal inducements have provided a “signing bonus” to states that join the NPT. Conditional, extra-treaty benefits to members can indeed play an important role in recruiting new signatories and help to broaden regime membership. These findings, in turn, suggest lessons for bolstering the NPT, frequently described as a “regime in crisis,” although we argue difficult tradeoffs may be necessary."
"August 13, 2009","In a recent article, Stathis Kalyvas observes that the new U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual “betrays zero impact by political science research” (2008, 351). Kalyvas attributes this to a dearth of policy relevant academic research on counterinsurgency campaigns. This is despite the fact that the analogies, intuitions, and assumptions underpinning the COIN manual’s policy guidelines could and should be subjected to more systematic empirical analysis. Leaders and decision makers tend to “reason by analogy,” applying the lessons of the last war, or a prominent case considered to be “similar” to the current situation, in order to determine the likely effectiveness of their various military options. But policymakers need more than analogous cases and recent experience in order to make informed decisions about whether and how to employ force in a particular situation."
"August 13, 2009","In recent years, an emerging pattern in the use of military force has become apparent: though the capability gap between advanced powers and non-state and insurgent actors has increased, the efficacy of achieving strategic goals with this power has decreased. To name a few, the United States, Israel, and Ethiopia have used overwhelming military power to achieve their goals in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Somalia.  Yet, in each case, the result has been an inability to restore order, remove insurgent or terrorist forces, and establish responsive governments.  What explains the inability of these stronger states to transform their power into outcomes? This paper explores this capability-increase/result-decrease dynamic and address its causes."
"August 13, 2009","Realist scholarship tends to focus on the baleful consequences of uncertainty.  In anarchy uncertainty about present and future intentions generates conflict – balancing, arms spirals, and war.  Realists do not claim these always result from uncertainty, but uncertainty is generally considered a foundational starting point.  We think certainty, not uncertainty, plays a much greater role in conflict than is recognized.  In this paper we challenge realism’s implicit assumption by developing certainty, particularly misplaced certainty, as a distinct and common pathway to war.  By misplaced certainty we mean cases where decision-makers are confident that they know each other’s capabilities and intentions or both, but they are wrong; and the sense of being right persists even in the face of disconfirming evidence.  The paper has two parts.  First, we conceptualize misplaced certainty by contrasting two models of the uncertainty/certainty relationship:  the risk model, which captures our conventional way of talking about uncertainty and certainty in terms of probabilities; and what we call a confidence model, which draws on the idea that decision-makers might reach certainty as a result of a fear of uncertainty.  The confidence model highlights an affective dimension of certainty, and suggests scope conditions for applying the risk model.  In the second part of the paper we take two examples of conflict pathways that often are thought to depend on uncertainty – spirals and appeasement – and show that the real driver is misplaced certainty.  Combining the logic we develop here of motivated misplaced certainty with cognitivist and domestic politics explanations of misplaced certainty already in the literature, the several dynamics of certainty would seem to challenge the privileged role of uncertainty in IR thinking."
"August 13, 2009","Democratization has become a key feature of post-conflict peace missions. The paper investigates how the expansion of the agendas of external actors has altered the nature of international peace missions from traditional peacekeeping missions towards costly open-ended missions in which external actors take on a wide range of governmental functions. In order to capture the evolution of peace missions quantitatively, an index for measuring mission intrusiveness is presented. The paper finds that although multidimensional missions are designed specifically for building democracy as a prerequisite for long-term peace and stability, they have not succeeded at producing democratic outcomes."

"August 13, 2009","Does oil hold special coercive power?  Could a country use the threat of oil cutoff to blackmail its enemies?  If so, what makes oil especially suited for political coercion?  Two perspectives exist on oil coercion: The popular view claims that oil has special coercive power because of its ability to inflict economic punishment on a society.  The academic wisdom argues that oil coercion provides little to no leverage because the global nature of the oil market renders embargos ineffective.  I argue that oil does hold special coercive leverage because cutoffs can undermine a country’s ability to defend itself.  Oil is the indispensible resource for war because military mobility hinges on it.  If a state could cutoff oil to its adversary, it could immobilize its forces and defeat it in war.  Thus, the threat of military denial, not economic punishment, gives oil its unique coercive potential.  But, if oil coercion has so much coercive power, why don’t we see more of it? Coercive success with oil is rare because states are strategic actors cognizant of this danger, and they take anticipatory measures to reduce their vulnerability before an opponent can coerce them.  These anticipatory measures may include war.  The paper illustrates the coercive power of oil denial through a case study of Japan’s surrender in WWII."

"August 13, 2009","In 1999 Sino-American relations experienced intense strain as a result of NATO’s Kosovo intervention, and in particular by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Why did the bombing of China’s embassy in Belgrade in the spring of 1999 touch such a raw nerve among the Chinese people and leadership? With the coming of the tenth anniversary of these events, what still needs to be explained is how Chinese and Americans could draw such divergent conclusions about that which they’ve never disagreed on – the incontestable fact of the embassy’s demolition - and how the fact that what Americans called “a mistake” could almost completely derail Sino-American relations, which President Clinton in his very successful visit to China a year before had called a “strategic partnership.”"
"August 13, 2009","What determines the outcome of nuclear crises?   Scholars have long debated whether nuclear superiority or the balance of resolve shapes the probability of victory in nuclear brinkmanship settings, but have not clearly articulated the possible mechanisms linking superiority to victory, nor have they systematically analyzed the entire universe of empirical cases.  Using a new dataset on fifty-six nuclear crises that includes information on nuclear arsenal size and the balance of resolve, this article analyzes the determinants of victory in nuclear crises.  I first describe two analytically distinct mechanisms by which nuclear superiority may improve a state’s prospects for victory in nuclear crises.  I then show that states that enjoy nuclear superiority over their opponents are more likely to win nuclear crises.  This relationship holds even after controlling for conventional military capabilities.  Explanations that conceive of nuclear conflict as a competition in risk taking, and that therefore emphasize the balance of resolve, do not find support in the data.  This article presents a new explanation of the advantages of nuclear superiority and the first comprehensive empirical examination of nuclear crisis outcomes."
"August 13, 2009","Does repression increase or decrease a movement‘s internal fragmentation? Conventional wisdom lends itself to two contradictory predictions. On the one hand, it is frequently said that conflict with an out-group is the surest path to unity in an in-group. On the other hand, repression disrupts the existing organizational basis of a movement and thereby challenges an important source of movement unity. In this paper, we take up these questions in the case of nationalist movements. We argue that repression amplifies pre-existing trends within a movement. Any movement has a particular institutional arrangement, meaning a set of procedures and relationships that structure decision-making and behavior. These ""rules of the game"" distribute power and resources within the movement, and are thus likely to favor some actors within it and disfavor others. Repression disrupts the equilibrium of these institutions, after which the members might engage in either more cooperation or more conflict, depending on the level of satisfaction with pre-existing institutional arrangements. If important groups feel stymied by existent institutions, they may want to change them but will be unable to do so as long as much of the rest of the movement is engaged in stable patterns of coordination. These groups are likely to take advantage of the disruption that comes with repression to try to advance a new set of institutions. This poses a challenge to vested interests within the movement, leading to increased internal conflict. By contrast, if groups within a movement are basically satisfied with an existing institutional arrangement, none will have incentives to change the situation once repression ensues. Under such conditions, a movement is likely to preserve its unity in the face of repression, or even become more united. We illustrate these propositions through comparative analysis of four episodes of repression from two nationalist movements in the Middle East: the Kurdish movement in Iraq and the Palestinian national movement. The implications of this research are multiple. It provides a basis for more accurate predictions of the consequences of repression. Moreover, it demonstrates the fruitfulness of viewing a national movement‘s unity as a matter of institutional equilibrium and tracing conflict and cooperation within a movement to disruptions of this equilibrium."
"August 13, 2009","The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have prompted significant research into the ethical and financial implications of utilizing private military and security contractors (PMSCs) in war.  Significantly less effort has been devoted to investigating how the broader commercialization of defense, expressed through the growing use of PMSCs as well as the rising influence of market factors as opposed to security concerns in the global arms trade, and how these trends affect security sectors in the developing world.   This paper outlines how particular aspects of this commercialization are enhancing the capabilities of corrupt and repressive police and military forces in authoritarian countries across the globe and what this means for global trends toward democratization.  To investigate this I look at (1) how the legislative and regulatory environment in which PMSCs and arms exporters operate promotes defense exchanges with developing world militaries that lack sufficient oversight or incentives to promote genuine peace and security, (2) marketplace relationships such as producer supply chains and financial incentive programs that establish more dense commercial connections between defense industries in developed and developing countries, (3) training programs and joint operations carried out by PMSCs in cooperation with developing country security sectors and how this impacts norms of military professionalism and the observation of human rights, and (4) the role of PMSCs in the creation of ‘enclaves of security’ that protect the dominant classes and illegitimate leaders upon whom developing country security sectors depend for patronage."
"August 13, 2009","Ethnic violence across many regions of Africa presents the international community with wrenching dilemmas and difficult decisions. While the images coming out of the Darfur region of Sudan are perhaps freshest in our minds, many other African countries have experienced outbreaks in the recent past – Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, the DRC, Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Burundi to name just a few. What is the responsibility of the international and regional communities in the face of such conflict? What are the best means for translating concern into action? This study grapples with these issues, by focusing in on one particularly difficult set of conflicts – ethnicity-related violent crises in Africa during the post-Cold War era - and one approach to crisis management – mediation."
"August 13, 2009","The purpose of this paper is to examine the reasons for which individuals participated in the Cambodian civil war, 1970-75, as combatants. The paper attempts to consider individuals’ behavior (participation, collaboration, and nonparticipation) in the civil war by looking at the structural contexts of both sides generated through their competition over public support and recruits. The case studies reveal that the structural contexts apparently determined how the government and rebels behaved. The government and local officials attempted to collect as many recruits as possible for both the military and militia by conducting either forcible or semi-forcible conscriptions wherever they could, and the rebels, exploiting their mobility, took advantage of chance opportunities and evacuated local villagers to their camps from the areas where their influence was relatively strong. Consequently, these overarching structural factors decided who participated in either the government or rebel forces, and how he/ she was mobilized. Most villagers who were evacuated by the rebels had no choice but to follow the rebels for their safety, while rebel participants from government areas were only volunteers who had been persuaded by rebellious propaganda and, so, politically motivated."
"August 13, 2009","In this paper, we show that leaders frequently use foreign policy to solve domestic problems, but they do so in ways that traditional diversionary war or scapegoat theories of international politics do not predict.  In contrast to scapegoat theory, which assumes that leaders use foreign crises and threats to rally and unify their publics, we argue that leaders use foreign policy to divide and segment domestic opinion.  Moreover, we show that often it is the party-out-of-power, not the party-in-power, that manipulates foreign crises and threats for electoral gain.  We develop this argument through an analysis of three cases involving U.S. foreign policy toward China.  In each case, leaders of the party-out-of-power used China as a “wedge issue” to divide and weaken the party-in-power – sometimes at considerable cost to America’s geopolitical interests and domestic civil liberties.  We discuss the implications of these cases for theorizing about domestic politics and foreign policy-making."
"August 13, 2009","Post-Cold War peacebuilding missions only rarely succeed in bringing democracy to postwar regimes. This paper argues that this modest track record can best be explained as a result of tacit bargaining between peacebuilders and local elites. Democratic transitions often threaten vital interests of local elites, and peacebuilders are often not willing to use their considerable leverage over local elites. We first describe the interests of priorities of peacebuilders and local elites in a typical post-conflict setting. We then develop a simple model of a bargaining process in a postwar situation in order to illustrate our main argument. We support our argument with empirical evidence from peacebuilding missions in Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda, Tajikistan and Afghanistan."
"August 13, 2009","This paper distinguishes between ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ violence during conventional civil wars. These two types differ in their forms of production: while indirect violence is unilaterally perpetrated by the armed group, direct violence is jointly produced by the armed group and civilians, and it hinges on local collaboration. These differences have consequences for the spatial variation of each of these types: indirect violence is hypothesized to be positively associated with levels of prewar support for the enemy group; in contrast, direct violence is hypothesized to increase together with the level of political parity between factions in a locality. The predictions are tested with self-collected data from 1,710 municipalities in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish civil war (1936-1939)."
"August 13, 2009","Which conditions do power-sharing governments rule more effectively? Adopting a disaggregated view of political power-sharing, we argue that certain components of political power-sharing are associated with better governance and duration of peace than others. In particular, countries that adopt closed-list proportional representation (PR) electoral systems tend to have superior governance outcomes and, as a result, experience more enduring periods of post-conflict peace and stability. Characteristics of closed-list PR systems such as tight party discipline, which provides more checks on executive power, and reduced incentives for personalistic voting, may account for the positive relationship between this electoral system and superior governance and regime survival. The introduction of political institutions in post-conflict peace agreements allows us to test the independent effects of institutions on governance and stability using large-n analysis and carefully selected case studies."
"August 13, 2009","In a recent article, Gibler examines how previous alliance violations affect future alliance potential during a leader’s tenure among dyads (2008).  Gibler shows reputation plays a role, however his models do not consider how power and democracy serve as mediating influences on the reputation effects of alliance violation.  We argue his theoretical argument fails to address the effects of constraints on involuntary defection from security commitments.  Involuntary defection arises from two different but endogenous sources: 1) a lack of tangible military resources and 2) a lack of sufficient domestic support among the principal veto players to fulfill the commitment.  Rationalists argue the effects involuntary defection on reputation should be treated differently when considering future cooperation (Chayes & Chayes 1995; Langlois & Langlois 2004).  Our interest is in how state reputations, as opposed to leader reputations, are affected by alliance violation with respect to future alliance formation when states violate alliances due to constraints.  Thus, we pose the following question: What effects do democracy, military capacity, and previous alliance violation have on future alliance potential for states? Though a crisp set analysis (Ragin 1989, 2000), we examine the effects of reputation, power, and democracy on future alliance commitments on a sample of 60 states in the modern era."
"August 13, 2009","The paper discusses whether Private Security Companies (PSCs) inhibit success in counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. Skeptics object that PSCs (1) are unreliable in a non-permissive COIN environment, (2) are grist to the insurgence mill as they employ aggressive tactics and alienating the population, (3) trigger credibility problems as they enjoyed impunity and (4) increase friction as they are not subordinated under the chain of command. Though many objections bear some substance, in neither case this means that PSCs need to be excluded from COIN operations. I argue that the problems were aggravated by the flawed COIN approach, the U.S. armed forces entertained prior to Iraq. Yet, parallel to the COIN learning process, the military also learned how to operate alongside armed contractors and how to integrate them. However, although some improvements were implemented, lessons learned have not yet been institutionalized and there is therefore a risk of running in the same problems in Afghanistan again."
"August 13, 2009","The London bomb attacks of 7 July 2005 are often cited amongst a series of events that have altered relations between Muslims and non-Muslims in Western Europe. We present the first systematic analysis of the effects of the attacks on the attitudes of ordinary Britons, using a survey that was in the field when the attacks occurred and includes a unique over-sample of respondents from ethnic and religious minorities. We measure the effects of this event using an interrupted time-series design. Multivariate matching is used to construct a ‘synthetic panel’ of otherwise similar individuals interviewed before and after the attacks, and differences in responses across these matched pairs are used to estimate the effects of the attacks on a set of political attitudes.  We find that the attacks increased perceptions of prejudice, but that different ethnic and religious groups responded in distinct ways. We find no evidence that British Muslims were induced to fear for their safety or their civil liberties. We disaggregate by date of interview and use a content analysis of British news media to examine the relationship between political attitudes and media coverage of the event and its aftermath. The paper provides evidence of media ‘priming’ effects in an information-rich context."
"August 13, 2009","Complainants face an arduous task in attempting to establish that they were subject to unlawful discrimination. In most instances the complainant bears the entire onus of proof and they are unlikely to have access to the evidence needed to discharge their burden. The difficulties that complainants confront have been acknowledged for the duration of Australian anti-discrimination law and yet they have not been addressed, even though there are useful mechanisms operating in other countries which Australia could adopt. This article examines three mechanisms used in the United Kingdom and Ireland which attempt to overcome the challenges complainants face with proving discrimination. Based on this examination it argues that Australian law should introduce a statutory ‘questionnaire procedure’ through which the complainant can obtain information relevant to the complaint, non-discretionary inferences if the respondent fails to provide an explanation for their behaviour and a shift in the burden of proof once the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination."
"August 13, 2009","Diversionary theory has largely been focused on democracies, specifically the United States and Great Britain. Attempts to explain the diversionary tendencies of non-democracies have not fully specified the conditions under which authoritarian leaders - who do not face a legitimate prospect of losing office through elections - should have the need to divert. This paper furthers the literature by offering two theoretical expectations that fill this gap. First, regimes that have background factors that promote a higher likelihood of a coup d’etat have greater incentive to divert. Second, this incentive to divert will decrease as efforts to address vulnerability though 'coup-proofing' increase. The theory is tested with global data from 1962-2000. The findings indicate that while coup vulnerability is not a universal determinant of diversion, it is common among non-democracies. Further, non-democracies are less likely to initiate disputes when other coup-proofing mechanisms are in place."
"August 13, 2009","In this paper we examine how the past alliance behavior of nations affects the likelihood that these states will be involved in alliance formation. We contend that nations evaluate the reputations of potential allies when searching for alliance partners. Reputation information is processed by governments along with other immediate concerns. By introducing a model and developing subsequent measures of reputational alliance histories we improve upon our current understanding of the factors that drive alliance formation."
"August 13, 2009","This paper examines the role of revenge and learning in relations between countries. Revenge and learning are discussed more often in terms of warfare and it is unclear how they influence the quality of peace. By relying upon a framework that captures several levels of peace, the paper is able to analyze the effects of revenge and learning on improving relations. Revenge and learning theory are analyzed through four factors: political settlement of the last war, costs of the last war, territorial exchange due to war, and past executive removal due to war. These factors are expected to have different effects across the levels of peace. The study statistically examines both the onset of war as well as transitions to higher levels of peace for all former belligerents since 1816 through event history analysis. The results show that both learning and revenge play a role following war and that the effects of the four factors vary considerably by level."
"August 13, 2009","Human rights treaties have been studied profusely, with much research studying specifically why some democracies ratify the treaties while others are slow to do so. Previous research has shown reasons why countries have ratified human rights treaties including monetary reasons, which include positioning themselves for aid and loans. Of the states that ratify human rights treaties previous research has shown that most do not readily obey the treaties, and of particular interest, is why these states do not obey the aforementioned treaties. Of specific interest are Islamic majority States since there is potential conflict between Shari’a Law and human rights treaties, especially the women’s rights aspects of these treaties. We examined levels of compliance in countries with high levels of Islamic fundamentalism (Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) and countries with controlled levels of Islamic fundamentalism (Egypt and Jordan). We found that in states with high levels of Islamic fundamentalism there is less compliance with the women’s rights aspects of human rights treaties compared to countries and instead yield to Shari’a law."
"August 13, 2009","The collapse of walls and borders after the Cold War has been coupled with a proliferation of transborder non-state actors. However, many non-state actors predate the state system itself. Surveying the phenomenon of traditional nomadism, this paper seeks to extend a critical dialogue about territoriality and borders in IR. Nomadism appears to present unique challenges to sovereignty. It destabilizes the state’s ability to maintain a territorially  fixed  population  under  law,  undermining  the  state’s  ability  to  control  its borders. Adopting a constructivist approach, we argue that nomadism constitutes as much an  ideational  as  a  material  threat  to  the  state.  The  impulse  to  delegitimate  and  curtail nomadism belongs to the ideational structure of sovereignty. By disrupting the territorial foundation  of  statehood,  nomadism  becomes  a  source  of  ontological  insecurity  for  the state."
"August 13, 2009","In this paper, we propose drawing on advances in the field of information theory and uncertainty analysis to strengthen the case study method of structured, focused comparison.  Structured, focused comparison can be very effective when a set of cases aligns to clearly show the impact of one or two central variables.  However, real problems in politics tend to have many sources of uncertainty and change.  Just as in large-N regression methods, we need a way to assess the relative explanatory power of different factors in those frequent contexts where several variables affect an outcome. Typical statistical approaches are unhelpful for analyzing complex nonlinear problems with a small number of cases. The information theory approach can improve the structured, focused case study method by providing systematic, comparable, and replicable measures of uncertainty and influence for the factors of interest. These analytic tools can enhance case study findings and ensure the maximum leverage for discerning between alternative explanations."
"August 13, 2009","In this paper we examine a model of terrorism which focuses on the tradeoffs facing a terrorist organization that has the ability to utilize either or both suicide and conventional terrorism tactics. The terrorist organization’s objective is to successfully attack at least one target. Success for the target government is defined as defending all targets from any and all attacks. In this context, we examine how terrorist entities strategically utilize suicide attacks when other modes of attack are available, and the optimal anti-terrorism measures."
"August 13, 2009","We present a new visual method for assessing the predictive power of models with binary outcomes.  This technique allows the analyst to quickly and easily choose among alternative model specifications based upon the models' ability to consistently match high-probability predictions to actual occurrences of the event of interest, and low-probability predictions to non-occurrences of the event of interest.  Unlike existing methods for assessing predictive power for logit and probit models such as the use of ""percent correctly predicted"" statistics, Brier scores and the ROC plot, our ""separation plot"" has the advantage of producing a visual display that is more informative and easier to explain to a general audience than a ROC plot, while also remaining insensitive to the user's often arbitrary choice of threshold for distinguishing between events and non-events.  We show how to implement this technique in R and demonstrate its effectiveness in building predictive models in four different areas of political research."
"August 13, 2009","On July 25, 1950, an American infantry unit killed a large number of refugees near the South Korean village of No Gun Ri. On December 12, 1948, a British patrol killed twenty-five civilians near the Malayan village of Batang Kali. On March 16, 1993, members of the Canadian Airborne Regiment beat a Somali teenager to death. While each event is horrific, they also represent only one side of the story; many units in these conflicts, facing similar threats, did not kill civilians. This variation raises a critical question: why do some units participate in war crimes while other do not?"
"August 13, 2009","Public perceptions of ongoing security threats and the impact that these perceptions have on the level of support for related policies are mediated by the perceived quality and integrity of information the public receives from the government. Information constraints regarding terrorism and war increase the importance of signals from the government relative to other sources to individuals when assessing these threats and evaluating counter-threat policies. Individuals are, however, critical consumers of information. Rather than uniformly accepting  elite signals or partisan cues, members of the public interpret and respond to government signals about ongoing threat differently depending on their perceptions of the objectivity and trustworthiness of the information it provides. We test this argument by analyzing the relationship between political party, ideology, and changes in the level of public trust in the information provided by the government about the war in Iraq on public perceptions of threat and the level of policy support for U.S. policy in Iraq. An analysis of a panel survey of U.S. respondents form 2007 through 2009 demonstrates that the changes in the level of trust in information has a significant impact on perceptions of threat and level of policy support. These effects are independent of political party and political ideology, which have no significant impact on changes in the level of trust, perceptions of threat, or level of policy support."
"August 13, 2009","What, if any, are the consequences of anti-Americanism for the U.S. national interest? In this paper, I focus on the economic consequences of anti-Americanism. Although Martin (2007) and many members of the U.S. business community claim anti-Americanism carries serious consequences for U.S. business, Katzenstein and Keohane (2007) find null results. In this paper, I revisit these claims. I first replicate and extend Katzenstein and Keohane’s (2007) work, and find some evidence that anti-Americanism may be at work in European purchases of American brand name products. Next, I develop and test several statistical models in which anti-American sentiment is predictive of cross-national variation over time in: (1) sales of Coca-Cola; (2) openings of Starbucks coffee shops; and (3) tourist arrivals and spending in the U.S. The results support the central hypothesis that anti-Americanism is predictive of outcomes harmful to U.S. economic interests. In the case of Coca-Cola, controlling for exchange rates, gross domestic product, temporal effects, and regional variation, there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between favorable attitudes toward the U.S. and sales volume of Coke. Similarly, favorable attitudes toward the U.S. are predictive of store openings of Starbucks around the globe. In the matter of tourism to the U.S., anti-Americanism is a robust predictor of both tourist arrivals and spending in the U.S., controlling for likely competing explanations. The results of this paper shed new light on the extent to which anti-Americanism is significant for U.S. economic interests."
"August 13, 2009","We test three central claims in the consociationalist literature: that in ethnically divided societies, conflict can be reduced by adopting (1) proportional representation over majoritarian electoral rules, (2) parliamentary over presidential or semi-presidential arrangements, and (3) a federal over a unitary system.  Previous research on these questions has suffered from two major flaws: a poorly-designed measure of “divided society,” and model specifications that do not take into account the conditional nature of institutional effects.  Correcting these flaws produces estimates that undercut much of the previous empirical support for consociationalist arrangements in divided societies.   In particular, the combination of PR, parliamentarism, and federalism appears to be a uniquely bad choice when ethnic fragmentation and regional concentration are high and income cross-cuttingness is low."
"August 13, 2009","Why do rulers employ ethnic exclusion at the risk of future civil war?  Focusing on the region of sub-Saharan Africa, I attribute this costly strategy to the commitment problem that arises in personalist regimes between elites with joint control of the state’s coercive apparatus.  As no faction can be sure that others will not exploit their violent capabilities to usurp power, elites maneuver to protect their privileged position and safeguard against others’ first-strike capabilities.  These defensive tactics, however, reinforce suspicions and increase intrigue within the regime, undermining trust and triggering a security dilemma.  In the face of a rising internal threat, rulers move to eliminate their rivals from the regime in order to guarantee their personal and political survival.  But the cost of such a strategy, especially when exclusionary practices fall along ethnic lines, is it increases the risk of a future civil war.  To test this argument, I employ the Ethnic Power Relations dataset combined with original data on the ethnicity of conspirators of coups and civil wars in Africa. I find that in Africa ethnic exclusion substitutes civil war risk for coup risk.  And rulers are significantly more likely to exclude their co-conspirators - the very friends and allies who helped them come to power - than other included groups, but at the cost of increasing the risk of a future civil war with their former allies. In the first three years after being purged from the central government, the co-conspirators and other members of their ethnic group are 15 times more likely to rebel than when they were represented at the apex of the regime."
"August 13, 2009","Armed groups have long posed an existential threat to the state. Whether we call them non-state actors, armed political action groups (APAGs) or simply armed groups, these entities operate outside the sovereign state’s monopoly on coercive force to achieve political goals in opposition to the state. Until fairly recently, armed groups lacked any true international capacity. The armed groups most relevant to the state were ones operating within its borders - be they those using psychological pressure to achieve a political goal (terrorists), furthering a criminal enterprise (organized crime), attempting to change the regime (insurgents) or simply resisting the will of the state through tribal or ethnic affiliation (militias). The goals of these groups, however, were usually domestically situated. We did not need the events of 9/11 to demonstrate that armed political action groups had an international agenda. The inherent international dimension to the drug trade connected local organized crime into international syndicates. Transnational links between terrorist groups began to become more apparent since the days of the ideologically motivated terrorists of the 1970s. Common ethnic lines of militias in different states have emerged and rare is the case that an insurgency does not have international support from either a state or a group outside the state. Armed groups are a de facto international actor."
"August 13, 2009","Within the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body, states are able to file complaints against other members regarding what they perceive to be unfair trade practices. However, this practice also potentially provides the opportunity for these member states to abuse the system to promote their own national interest by filing complaints against those states that they deem as economic threats. Such practices would be potentially counterproductive to the very purpose of the Dispute Settlement Body, as well as serve to undermine the primary mission of the WTO itself. There is a gap in the current literature regarding interstate rivalries, in that the study of rivalries has been isolated to that of military rivals and has not been explored in other types of international interactions. In this paper, I will contribute to our understanding of the extent to which individual member states altruistically use international organizations to further international cooperation or intentionally manipulate these international organizations to further their individual policy goals. Using the military rivalry literature as a basis, the evolution of trade rivalries is explored using WTO dispute data. I derive a hypothesis from the endogenous protection literature that dyads with high levels of trade interdependence will file a significant number of WTO disputes in order to block access to their markets and third markets for competitive goods being produced by both states. Using an empirical test, rivalries within this cooperative context becomes apparent, as dyads with previous disputes are more likely to be involved in disputes in the future."
"August 13, 2009","""Geopolitics"" in this paper refers to the significance of Korea's geographic location as it relates to the foreign policies of the major powers vis-a-vis the Korean Peninsula. The paper examines the geopolitical behavior the three close neighbors -- China, Russia, Japan, plus the United States, as they relate to the North Korean nuclear issue.  In short, China and Russia see it in their interest to side with North Korea in the Six-Party Talks.  Ironically, the previous two South Korean governments have been sympathetic with North Korea, thus forming a Group of Four favorable to North Korea on the nuclear issue. The United States with Japan have been on the defense against this alliance of interests and the result has not been satisfactory. Washington learned that Pyongyang is believed to have at least a half dozen nuclear weapons. The paper concludes that the North Korean nuclear problem is not likely to be settled easily because the issue at the core is the geopolitical importance of the Korean Peninsula to its neighbors. The primary interests of the four powers are to stay involved in the Korean Peninsula, and the solution to the nuclear problem remains secondary."
"August 13, 2009","Democratic transitions in former Soviet satellites and in decolonised sub-Saharan Africa have in many instances triggered civil conflict, as governments seek to build states and nations in complex, ethnically fragmented societies.  The South Pacific – particularly the highly fragmented cultural area of Melanesia – is another region in which such conflict has occurred.  This paper will consider the interaction between state and nation-building in fragmented Melanesian societies, and will argue that the two processes must occur simultaneously.  A state must be built so that it becomes relevant to peoples’ lives, if they are to owe it their allegiance and grant it legitimacy.  Yet a sense of allegiance – or nationhood – is also needed in order to motivate people to build the state, and for the state to function.  ‘Modern’ models of Western liberal statehood have so far had limited success in the processes of state and nation-building in Melanesia, where political community is understood communally and is still highly influenced by concepts of ‘tradition’ and ‘culture’.  These processes have also been complicated by social changes brought about by economic development, urbanisation, migration, globalisation and the availability of new technologies. This paper therefore concludes that a path needs to be navigated between so-called ‘modern’ and ‘traditional’ modes of state and nation-hood, and argues that new hybrid forms of political regime may need to be considered."
"August 13, 2009","Over the last six decades, militaries around the world have introduced new elite units in at unprecedented pace. These units should have led to less reliance on larger, less skilled units in specific types of military operations including long range reconnaissance, the usage of highly sophisticated technologies such as laser pointers and advanced anti tank and anti aircraft missiles, raids from the sea and counterinsurgencies. Yet, instead of focusing on their designated roles, such units often seem to gravitate towards operations which demand different sets of skills, most notably counterterrorism. The objective of this paper is to explain why elite soldiers who go through extensive and costly training are being deployed to operations which endanger them and as a result may undermine the ability of their unit to carry out the missions for which it was established in a time of need."
"August 13, 2009","Since the Islamic Revolution transformed Iran’s political system thirty years ago there have been significant violations of human rights including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, and other basic civil and political liberties. This essay examines the ebb and flow of human rights since the Revolution. Why has Iran consistently experienced a lack of political freedom and protection of human rights over the last thirty years and even during the Khatami presidency? Two reasons help explain this pattern: a specific and narrow interpretation of Islam and perceived domestic and international threats to the regime. Given the fact that human rights violations in Iran are less of a priority to many Western governments given the concern with Iran’s nuclear program, this essay explores possible approaches to seeing improvements in human rights via a modification of the spiral model."
"August 13, 2009","Much has been made recently about the use of fear and anxiety in emergencies to justify extraordinary pre-emptive actions.  In this paper I explore how pre-emption feels as an after-affect.  To this end, I argue that pre-emption has become a generalized grammar that rivals sovereignty.  On the backs of fear and anxiety, pre-emption, the precautionary principle, the responsibility to protect etc… have become effective ways of managing a proliferating range of political problems.   However, once pre-emption is realized, I argue the after-affect changes.   Instead of fear, anxiety or even docility becoming the affective experience in the after-glow of pre-emption, I conclude the paper by arguing that hope sets in and rules the day.  I explore this argument through the case of the Avian Flu Emergency."
"August 13, 2009","In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed, abandoned communism, and the Cold War ended.  In 2001 the United States was attacked by terrorists and subsequently invaded a state that was not a serious threat to its security.   No two events have impacted the United States, and arguably the international system, in the past twenty years as profoundly."
"August 13, 2009","Building on earlier studies, this paper expands on the principles underlying the process of developing a coherent amnesty, reconciliation and reintegration (AR2) policy. It explores the paradoxical way the U.S. military, as an instrument of that policy, might act as a reconciler. The paper uses a model that points to the dynamic interrelationships among the dimensions of a society engaged in the AR2 process. It examines how the introduction of an external 'armed reconciler' affects both the societal dimensions of the process and the correlation between amnesty, in some form, and reconciliation."
"August 13, 2009","Classical counterinsurgency theory explains why discriminate counterinsurgency violence is effective, but does not convincingly explain why many counterinsurgents resort to indiscriminate violence and why it sometimes appears effective. Political scientists explain the motivation for indiscriminate counterinsurgency violence, but do not convincingly explain when it should be inefficient relative to discriminate violence. I formalize the model of insurgency found in the classical counterinsurgency literature to derive predictions over the discrimination of violence that the counterinsurgent uses. The theory explains when discriminate violence is more/less efficient from the counterinsurgent’s perspective and how enforcement behavior on the part of the rebels and population affects the counterinsurgent’s strategy. The counterinsurgent defeats the insurgency by deterring cooperation between the rebels and population. It targets the actor - be it the rebel group or the population - with the greater short term temptation to defect from its accomplice, regardless of the consequences. Thus, the counterinsurgent targets the actor who profits most from war, where profit is the temptation for wartime opportunism minus the costs. I discuss two examples of this pattern occurring during insurgencies in Guatemala and Turkey."
"August 13, 2009","In the process of its “Eastern Enlargement,” the integrating European Union created arguably the most densely institutionalized minority rights regime in any region in the world.  Although the specific forms that minority protection should take were not mandated by European institutions, a broadly shared expectation was that “Europeanization” and democratization together would moderate nationalist aspirations in post-communist Europe, where a history of competitive nation-building and shifting borders had made societies particularly vulnerable to “ethnic conflict.” Yet almost two decades after the beginning of the “transition” from Communism to democracy and from the Soviet bloc to the EU, we know remarkably little about the resulting patterns of majority-minority competition and minority integration in the region.  In an effort to advance our understanding of those patterns, this paper explores the broader issue of minority integration by focusing on the way minorities use political resources to negotiate claims in the framework of democratic contestation.  In the CEE countries that have joined the EU since 2004 as consolidated democracies, significant variation emerged in this respect, despite similarities in the considerable structural limitations that minority actors faced in shaping institutions. The paper addresses the question of how different types of minorities have participated in the institutions of democratic contestation, by exploring the distinction between historic/territorial and non-historic/territorial minorities. Perhaps the most consistent organizing principle of majority-minority relations in Europe has been the notion of inherited rights to institutions, according to which: (a) members of the state’s national majority have an a priori right to the state, while (b) the rights of minorities are structured by a hierarchical distinction between historic minorities and immigrant groups. The analysis focuses on four new EU member states: Romania and Slovakia (with historic Hungarian minorities); and Estonia and Lithuania (with Russian-speakers that are viewed as recent settlers in both states and a historic Polish minority in Lithuania).  The comparative evaluation indicates that the notion of inherited institutions remains a significant source of political action for majorities and also helps explain the way minorities claim and “inhabit” political institutions in these newly consolidated European democracies."
"August 13, 2009","This paper explores the Post Cold War origins of the organized criminal violence that once gripped Colombia and now grips Mexico and particularly the highly controversial counterinsurgency strategy used in Colombia that forms the basis for the current strategy in Mexico. It argues that ideology is a reason why the military aspect of these problems was neglected for so long and the reason its detractors see it as a strategy that reduces national sovereignty and endangers democracy when statistics on control of territory, reduction of violence and democratic progress demonstrate the opposite to be true. The paper uses the term “colombianization” to emphasize Colombia’s dramatic shift from almost ungovernable to one of the most stable countries in the region. Colombianization is defined not as a counterdrug strategy as are both the Colombian and Mexican U.S. assistance strategies but as an integrated, law-based, counterinsurgency strategy implemented from the bottom up that facilitates the establishment of elite consensus and puts the country on a path toward rule of law.  Ironically, it was democratic and free market reforms that strengthened the forces of instability in both Colombia and Mexico and the militarization of security that appears to facilitate democratic stability.  This study uses local level assessments of Plan Colombia and local interviews conducted in Chihuahua and Michoacán to evaluate the prospects of colombianization in urban and rural Mexico.  Colombia's experience suggests that colombianization can stabilize the country and help reactivate the economy but democratic progress is painfully slow and the strategy has little impact on the drug industry and the corruption associated with it."
"August 13, 2009","Scholars generally agree that wartime coalitions composed of states with disparate preferences tend to collapse postwar. Such alliances therefore should do little to constrain state’s postwar policy options. In contrast, alliances of like-minded states are believed more likely to endure, and should therefore be better at implementing postwar policies. But when faced with the potentially costly task of removing and replacing the defeated regime, allies with disparate preferences may refuse to allow regime change, while allies with similar preferences may refuse to pay for it. Drawing from collective action and veto players theories, this paper argues that when preferences over the successor regime diverge, comparably powerful allies will veto each other’s proposals, resulting in the maintenance of the status quo. When preferences converge, allies will free-ride, in the hopes that someone else will pay for the collective good. Accordingly, as the number of comparable powers in an alliance increases, the probability of foreign-imposed regime change should decrease. Results from a statistical test of victories in militarized interstate disputes (1816-2003) confirm this hypothesis, while three case studies verify that veto players and collective action problems impair states’ ability to engage in truly multilateral foreign-imposed regime change."
"August 13, 2009","This paper offers early development of a theory of how a society's identity system affects its ability to change its perception of an adversary following a conflict. The author first presents separately researched findings regarding the ability of established theoretical schools to explain variation in inter-state reconciliation outcomes, thus providing a basis to assess the relative usefulness of a new identity theory. Second, the author develops a formal model that captures the core aspects of his identity theory, and describes the results of experimentation with that model. Finally, the author assesses the relevance of his experimentation findings for the broader reconciliation literature."
"August 13, 2009","In February 2006, following an early morning immigration raid, five unidentified bodies were drudged from a small lake in the Selayang area of Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur.  It is a region well known for housing migrant workers, who collectively represent about 20 percent or around 2 million of Malaysia’s total workforce. Many such workers are undocumented in Malaysia, with estimates indicating that the country experiencessome of the largest irregular migration flows in the world.  Despite the brutality involved, no onewas ever charged or prosecuted for these murders.  Migrants who escaped the raid, however, allege that this brutal crackdown was conducted by the country’s controversial baton-wielding civilian volunteer corps called Ikatan Relawan Rakyat or Rela.  Quite strikingly, this nationalist organization’s approximate 500,000 volunteers – most of whom are Malay males – outnumber the combined total of Malaysia’s military and police, which equals about 111,500.  This vigilante corps has its roots in auxiliary forces that battled communist insurgents during the British colonial era.  In recent years, the Malaysian government has delegated extraordinary powers to Rela volunteers in tackling the so-called new security threat of transnational migration.  The government’s immigration policies have not only involved authorizing private volunteers to arrest and detain undocumented laborers, but officials have also increasingly used public discourse to link migrants and refugees with all things undesirable, ranging from crime to chronic diseases."

"August 13, 2009","The purpose of this paper is to provide a better conceptualization of insurgent strategies.  Specifically, I shall examine Che Guevara’s “Foco” theory of insurgency, as it is one of the most theoretically popular and most pervasive strategies of insurgency currently practiced throughout the world.  After briefly examining the origins, objectives and theoretical strengths of the Foco (also known as the Vanguard Theory) theory, I will argue that Guevara’s theory suffers from an internal tension that I term the “Vanguard’s Dilemma.”  Simply put, the Vanguard’s dilemma is a decision insurgents must make between the desire to maintain a secure base away from the reach of government control (security) versus the need to be in constant contact with the population in order to increase its popularity (publicity).  The significance of this dilemma between the desire for security and the need for publicity creates a tension within the Vanguard Theory that can be fatal for insurgents if properly exploited by counter-insurgent operations.  This paper will examine in detail this dilemma and show how it can be exploited.  Given that several insurgent groups within Iraq currently adhere to the Vanguard Theory of insurgency, a proper understanding of insurgent strategy is an essential first step in the long road towards confronting and winning asymmetrical conflicts."
"August 13, 2009","Abstract will be provided by author.Wars reveal information about states’ capability, intentions, and resolve. Wars thus provide opportunities for states to learn about their rivals, and existing studies suggest that rivals do learn from their conflict interactions, especially crises and wars.  But do rivals also learn from wars other than their own?  The present study investigates the possibility that states learn by observing “third-party wars”—wars involving a rival state and some third party.  Vicarious learning is discussed with a particular focus on the rivalry context.  An historical case study of the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars is used to illustrate and further explore the potential learning processes associated with third-party wars.  The paper concludes with a brief discussion of other cases suitable for investigation."
"August 13, 2009","A significant puzzle exists regarding the role of domestic politics in the likelihood of international conflict. A number of theories point to advantages that democracies possess that should allow them to avoid warfare. However, empirical studies have shown that democracies are disproportionately likely to receive military challenges. This study seeks to resolve this puzzle by examining the role that the unity of the government and the views of the government towards the use of force play in the targeting of democracies. The theory presented argues that divided dovish governments are particularly likely to suffer from military challenges as they are unable to credibly signal their intentions. In particular, divided governments have difficulty signaling their interests, taking decisive action, and may appear weak. The theory will be tested on a new dataset that examines the theory in the context of international territorial disputes. A number of significant findings emerge from the data. First, divided governments are significantly more likely to face challenges and increasing government unity markedly decreases the likelihood of a challenge. Second, government divisions have a much larger substantive impact than any of the other variables. These results are confirmed through the use of two different dependent variables and matched as well as unmatched datasets."
"August 13, 2009","How does international intervention affect decisions to develop professional and responsive security forces after civil wars? In states emerging from conflict, effective military and police forces are crucial for enhancing security for the public, preventing renewed conflict or abuse, and serving as a basis for democratic development.  Despite numerous attempts to transform armed groups into more professional security forces, the record of success has been mixed.  Political resistance has undermined efforts by international organizations and outside states and left many countries’ security forces weak and politicized.  While external assistance may translate into external influence leading to a greater likelihood of reform, it may also fuel corruption and weaken incentives for reform.  This paper draws from bargaining and network theories to show how conditions that create brokerage opportunities for elites in control of armed forces, and that foster dependence on these elites for security, strengthen their leverage relative to external actors and their publics and weaken incentives to build more professional or responsive forces.  Through quantitative analysis, I test the effects of three conditions that affect the leverage of post-conflict elites on the likelihood that they will build more professional security forces:  the fragmentation among security actors; the extent of competitive political participation; and the presence of easily accessible resources.  I illustrate through brief descriptions of security sector reform efforts in Sierra Leone and Timor Leste how international organizations and donor states may alter these conditions to affect the likelihood of security sector transformation."
"August 13, 2009","The demand for states to apologize for their wrongdoings has become more and more accepted internationally. The growing incidence of political apologies, places pressure on wrongdoers, to come to terms with their past and solve the conflict related to their transgression. However, some former wrongdoer states still prefer not to acknowledge their own wrongdoing, even though the price is prolonged conflict. Given that this position is a barrier to resolving the protracted conflict connected to the wrong, one can only wonder why the wrongdoer does not condemn its own transgression? The paper seeks to understand this behavior through the Turkish-Armenian case. The aim is to understand Turkey’s constant refusal (or denial) to recognize the Armenians’ suffering during the First World War as genocide. For over 90 years, Turkey has spared no effort to silence this event in its past and exclude it from its state’s memory. Ankara not only denies that what happened can be regarded as genocide, but also persuades – and even pressures – other governments to silence this event, too. The key to understanding the Turkish position can be found in the Turkish identity. The hypothesis is that an acknowledgment of the Armenian genocide would challenge the Turkish state memory and thus its identity."
"August 13, 2009","Since President Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983, U.S. policymakers have spent more than $100 billion and over 25 years pursuing Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) without reaching consensus on the issues of strategic prudence or technical capability. BMD Supporters and Opponents persistently disagree about the effect of pursuing BMD on the credibility of U.S. nuclear deterrence and arrive at divergent conclusions about the meaning of existing data for the eventual capability of a BMD system. Who is right?  How does the pursuit and possession of BMD affect the credibility of U.S. nuclear deterrence? And what is the U.S. capability to build a BMD?  Through analysis of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), I demonstrate that contrary to the Realist treatment of military power, the strategic prudence and technical capability of BMD are socially constructed and mutually constitutive terms.  In short, neither BMD Supporters nor Opponents are “right.”  Uncertainty about the strategic implications and eventual capability of BMD means that each group’s strategic and technical judgments are rooted in one of two hypothetical scenarios describing nuclear conflict.  And not only do policymakers’ assessments of one term reaffirm the other over time, but those mutually constitutive assessments persistently frame the policy decisions that determine the material capability of BMD.  My findings suggest policy recommendations for ending the polarized U.S. debate over BMD as well as contribute to scholarship on the necessary conditions for credible nuclear deterrence and the materialist treatment of military power."
"August 13, 2009","While much is known about peacekeeping and peacebuilding, less is known about how the UN performs as a conflict manager. We explore the UN’s impact on the duration of crises or conflicts.  We posit that UN involvement introduces competing effects on the timing of crisis abatement. To hasten the end of hostilities, the UN can use leverage to expand the set of alternatives that are preferable to conflict, guarantee terms of settlement and help the actors save face. Often at the same time, the UN can also delay settlement. Benignly, the UN can be part of a time-consuming peace process. More pernicious, UN intervention can interfere with the ability for the combatants to learn about the capabilities and resolve of their opponents or otherwise complicate and confuse the bargaining environment. We use new events data on UN interventions to examine how different types of UN involvement have varying effects on the pace of crisis termination. Consistent with expectations, we find that active diplomatic involvement has an immediate effect of lengthening crises but begins to hasten the rate of abatement over time. Operational deployments tend to only lengthen crises, while passive diplomacy has no observable effect."
"August 13, 2009","We study the conflict mediation problem when the mediator must gather information from the disputants. In this case, the same incentives that disputants have to lie to their opponents  also exist when talking to the mediator.  Addressing this issue in the context of a very general model of information mediation, we show that the incentive that disputants have to lie to the mediator undoes any advantage that might be gained by adding communication with a third party.   In fact, our main result shows that any equilibrium outcome that is achievable through mediation is also achievable as an equilibrium outcome of a game with unmediated pre-play communication.  This is true even when the mediator is allowed to have arbitrary preferences or biases."
"August 13, 2009","Ever since nuclear weapons were created in the mid 1940s, the US has tried to prevent, or at least minimize their diffusion and transfer to other states, especially beyond the five NPT-recognized nuclear-weapons states (NWS). Throughout the decades of the Cold War and beyond, successive American administrations attempted to retard the development of nuclear weapons programs abroad, an endeavor that continues to this day. There have been exceptions to this effort as the US, through the years, has come to recognize, either explicitly or implicitly, several new NWS, with India being the most recent example of such recognition. This phenomenon raises an important theoretical and policy-related question: under what conditions does the US recognize new NWS and what steps precede such recognition?"
"August 13, 2009","This article addresses a historical puzzle: Why did the insurgent PKK (Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan), which was militarily defeated, which renounced the goal of secession, and whose leader was under the custody of the Turkish state, remobilize its armed forces in a time when opportunities for the peaceful solution of the Kurdish question were unprecedented in Turkey? The PKK’s radicalization at a period of EU-induced democratization in Turkey counters the conventional argument that fostering democracy would reduce the problems of ethnic conflict. Explanations based on resource mobilization, political opportunity structures, and cognitive framing fail to provide a satisfactory answer. The article argues that democratization will not necessarily facilitate the end of violent conflict as long as it introduces competition that challenges the political hegemony of the insurgent organization over its ethnic constituency. Under the dynamics of competition, the survival of the organization necessitates radicalization rather than moderation. As long as the insurgent organization successfully recruits new militants, democratization is not a panacea to violent conflict. The findings indicate that research on the micro-level dynamics of insurgency recruitment will contribute to a better understanding of ethnic conflict management. The data comes from multiple sources including ethnographic fieldwork, statistical analyses of quantitative data (i.e., spatial autocorrelation and ecological inference), and systematic reading of original documents."
"August 13, 2009","Armed conflicts as distant as those in Sri Lanka and Northern Ireland have been fueled by co-ethnic supporters of the combatants.  Yet civil wars also draw in third parties who are not related to the combatants: opposing US and Soviet interventions in southern Africa and Central America provide several prominent examples.  While we know that biased interventions in civil wars have different effects that neutral efforts, does it matter who intervenes and the tools they employ?"
"August 13, 2009","Twenty-one years of war, destruction, and the displacement of over 1.5 million people have turned northern Ugandan into a humanitarian disaster. One of the war’s principal perpetrators has been the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). A significant shift in the war occurred in late 2005 when the LRA withdrew its forces to the southern Sudan and then crossed the Nile, assembling in Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the summer of 2006, peace talks between the Government of Uganda and the LRA commenced in Juba, and a first Cessation of Hostilities Agreement was signed on 26 August 2006. With the withdrawal of the LRA to the Congo, security in northern Uganda has improved considerably. Some displacement-camp residents have moved to new settlement sites closer to their villages. Yet others fear leaving the relative safety of the camps until a final peace agreement has been signed and the LRA fighters have been demobilized. This is a delicate stage of the conflict, and a deeper understanding of the needs and desires of affected populations will be crucial to a long-term resolution."
"August 13, 2009","This paper documents and proposes an explanation for a puzzling empirical trend: the number of wars ending in a draw, rather than with a victory for one side, has increased markedly over time.  This change in war outcomes occurs for interstate wars after WWII, and for civil wars after the end of the Cold War.  I argue that this change, and its timing in the two types of war can best be explained by the development of peacekeeping.  For war to end in a draw, two conditions must hold: neither side is able to defeat the other outright, and the belligerents can agree to stop fighting rather than continuing the war in the hope of eventual victory.  Using this framework, I outline and test a number of possible explanations for the shift in outcomes.  I rule out a number of alternative explanations, including the offense-defense balance, patterns of intervention, terrain, population growth, and issue salience.  Only the peacekeeping argument can explain the change in both civil and interstate wars."
"August 13, 2009","Do armed actors in civil war reap strategic benefits from limiting civilian casualties and abiding by the laws of war? Furthermore, do civilians reward and punish armed actors for their behavior toward civilians? We study the strategic impact of civilian casualties in the Iraqi Civil War using original geo-coded data on Coalition-insurgent violence and on civilian casualties between February 2004 and December 2007. We argue that information civilians provide to Coalition forces is a key determinant of insurgent violence and provide evidence that this information ebbs and flows with how discriminately each actor treats the civilian population. We find that clear evidence that Coalition forces are punished for the collateral damage they inflict on civilians and that this indiscriminate behavior hurts the Coalition’s strategic objectives by increasing subsequent battlefield violence. We find limited evidence that civilians punish insurgent forces for their indiscriminate violence against civilians, at least in terms of reductions in subsequent violence. Besides implications for counter-insurgency policy, our data and findings advocate for the modeling of civil war-related outcomes at the sub-national level and for the inclusion of civilian agency in theories of insurgent violence."
"August 13, 2009","An important topic in the militarized international territorial conflict literature has been identifying factors that increase its likelihood. The focus in these investigations has often been on the presence of territorial claims and on why the disputed land is valued – that is, whether the land is economically or strategically important or whether it is valued because it means something to the disputants (i.e. ethnic, religious, ancestral importance). A limitation of all such claim- and value-based explanations is, however, that these are static phenomena that are continuously present from one year to the next, if not over decades. In contrast, militarized engagements over territory tend to be comparatively rare and take place during some years but not others. The extant explanations therefore tend to both over-predict the incidences of actual militarized conflict and fail to account for the conflict’s timing. To deal with these problems, prior works have often relied on the changes in the relative power distribution to explain the over time variation in the incidence of fights over territory. While this strategy has proved empirically fruitful (i.e. the relative power variable is almost always significant), the theoretical issue nevertheless remains because notable changes in relative power distribution tend to be quite infrequent. In this project, I instead focus on the domestic political factors in order to explain the timing of militarized territorial conflict. I take particular note of the dynamic variables such as the domestic political situation and argue that the state of domestic politics provides important motivations for the leaders with respect to the timing of militarized territorial conflicts. Empirical analyses covering all state pairs in the post-World War II period provide much support for this domestically-based explanation of the timing of territorial fights, even when the traditional correlates of territorial conflict (i.e. territorial claims and relative power) are taken into account."
"August 13, 2009","In this project, I examine the decisions of major powers to pursue military occupation as a strategy to stabilize less powerful states. To do so, I develop a baseline game theoretic model that examines the strategic decisions of major powers to pursue short-term intervention and long-term occupation in a potentially unstable target state. The model indicates military occupation decisions are a function of both inter-power politics and the domestic political conditions in the target state. In addition to these implications, I discuss a number of potential extensions of the baseline model that could provide a more complete theory of occupation and intervention."
"August 10, 2009","This Essay, written for the South Texas Law Review’s Ethics Symposium, considers the role of international legal argument in the war on terror and, in particular, in the attempts to justify the use of military force. It focuses on the relationship of credible legal arguments to legitimacy and reputation."
"August 08, 2009","Assume that players strictly rank each other as coalition partners.  We propose a procedure whereby they 'fall back' on their preferences, yielding internally compatible, or coherent, majority coalition(s), which we call fallback coalitions. If there is more than one fallback coalition, the players common to them, or kingmakers, determine which fallback coalition will form. The players(s) who are the first to be acceptable to all other members of a fallback coalition are the leader(s) of that coalition. The effects of different preference assumptions - particularly, different kinds of single-peakedness - and of player weights on the number of coherent coalitions, their connectedness, and which players become kingmakers and leaders are investigated. The fallback procedure may be used (i) empirically to identify kingmakers and leaders or (ii) normatively to select them.  We illustrate the model by applying it to coalition formation on the U.S. Supreme Court, 2005-2008."
"August 08, 2009","This Article was written during the last days of Bill Clinton’s presidency as negotiations toward an Israeli-Palestinian settlement seemed to be on track toward some sort of agreement. The Article responds to the argument made by Professor John Quigley that certain elements of the anticipated compromises on such issues as borders, settlements, displaced persons, and Jerusalem would violate Palestinian rights under international law that were beyond the power of the Palestinian authorities to negotiate away."
"August 08, 2009","The past century of research has identified a host of economic, political, demographic, and other factors that seem to be associated with the prevalence of riots. The study of riots has, however, probably focused too much on these “push” factors that lead to violence and not enough on understanding the response of the state to riots. Understanding the political incentives that motivate democratic and authoritarian states to sometimes allow riots to take place and at other times to take the strongest possible law-and-order measures to prevent them is key to understanding variation in violence. Scholars also need to pay more attention to the psychological factors that encourage people to riot, and to the micro-logic of target choice within these larger events."
"August 08, 2009","This study examines the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. It employs the theories of primordialist, constructivist, pre-colonialists, colonial theorists, modernization, vote-maximization, and institutional decay to understand Sri Lanka's three decades old violent ethnic conflict. This paper gives focus, in the context of these theories, to how the vote maximization strategy of the Sinhala political elites marginalized the ethnic minorities, particularly the Tamils, who lost trust in the state and its institutions and eventually adopted a violent struggle for secession"
"August 07, 2009","It is sometimes the case that a debate goes off the rails so early that riders assume the rough country around them is the natural backdrop for their travels. That is certainly true in the debate over reparations in transitions to democracy. Reparations traditionally are understood as material or symbolic awards to victims of an abusive regime granted outside of a legal process. While some reparations claims succeed - such as those made by Americans of Japanese descent interned during World War II and those made by European Jews against Germany after World War II - most do not. The principal culprits in these failures are objections that reflect commitments to “ethical individualism.”"

Brief descriptions of individual experiences of women and girls during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina provide an insight into the nature of the trauma, the needs of victims and Medica Zenica's assistance. The organization has also actively engaged in furthering public awareness, advocating government support, and appropriate legislative measures."
"August 05, 2009","United Nations Secretary General, declaring 2009 as the year of Climate Change, has called for 'responsibility to protect' in the realm of human rights and 'responsibility to deliver' in larger sphere of common international action. Anthropogenic climate change leads to biophysical transformation on the global scale engendering localised stresses in the forms of coastal erosion, ice melt, infertile land and deteriorating water sources.These stresses threaten critical minimum basic needs of vulnerable socities without the capabilities of adaption and resilence. Neither the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, nor its Kyoto Protocol has any provision of protection or rehabilitation to numerous affected poor people of less developed world. Refugee Convention does not confer refugee status for environmental persecution. Northern knowledge-power had set the norms to reinforce dominance over the international system that can not reflect on the environment in a broader political and cultural context of a region or a country. The twentieth century has spanned through two world wars, post-war recovery-boom-burst and emergence of   neo-liberal globalisation .The treadmill of production is founded on classical Say's law of capitalist circulation-supply creates its own demand and drives the expansion of production and consumption synergistically.  The industrialised North  has  emitted massive  greenhouse gases, with increasing energy- and chemical-intensive production since the 'outbreak' of cold war, and has polluted the environment to a catastrophic extent that is largely irreversible.The zero-sum game has its obvious toll on wretched teeming millions  of 'other' world as the 'development of underdevelopment' diversifies with deadlier dimensions. The victimised populations become uprooted from their habitats and forced to migrate, even to foreign countries to join the researve army of lobour there and get entrapped in new conflicts and crises. The citizens of a bordered territory are entitled to fundamental rights which their fellow human beings, the irregular migrants, can never be provided. As with capabilities approach by Sen and Nussbaum, if outcome of climate degradation potentially undermine fundamental rights and human security, enshrined as global norms, policy as well as national policies of the industrialised countries, the concerns about justice should be the prime mover of global climate governance. The emancipatory ideas about rights, justice and responsibility should transcend the 'bordered' confines with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This insight has definite resemblance with Derridan concepts of 'new international' and 'democracy to come'. Ultimately, a successful adaptation process has to reflect on how the command of natural resources and environmental goods has forged the plunder of climate and human habitats by the interplay of a host of historical, ecological, social and economic factors. An internationally agreed measure of ecological debt would clarify 'over-polluting' countries’ contribution towards climate change-enforced human vulnerabilities.Beyond the refugee definition contained in the Refugee Convention, the pertaining issue is to be addressed by a new legal instrument - a Protocol on Recognition, Protection, and Resettlement of Climate Refugees to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"August 05, 2009","This article examines the effects of elite framing on conflict transformation. It utilises debates from the Turkish Grand National Assembly as the main source of empirical evidence and demonstrates the differences in the way Turkish parliamentarians framed national and foreign policy issues in the 1990s. For the most part, elite framing of Kurdish issues was predominantly monolithic and adversarial towards ‘ethnic others’, demonstrating few challenges to dominant nationalist narratives and discourses, while framing of Greek-Turkish disputes was diverse, with moderates cautiously challenging hardliners on the necessity of cooperating with Greece. The article unravels these elite framing strategies and illustrates how framing becomes embedded in public identities, opportunity structures and definitions of national interest, influencing crisis escalation and conflict management in the Eastern Mediterranean region."
"August 05, 2009","In situations of armed conflict or violence, a significant number of children below the age of eighteen join armed groups on their own volition. That they do so challenges received ideas of children as vulnerable or passive victims and provides evidence that they are also creative and resilient actors aiming to improve their lives. This article examines their reasons for “joining up”. In order to further preventive action in their behalf, it adopts the probabilistic notion of “children at risk” and describes the complex set of interrelated individual and environmental factors that have been found to enhance or decrease the likelihood that children will join armed groups. It discusses how preventive responses may be tailored to specific levels of risk and also examines the lessons learnt so far in this field. It concludes by describing responsibilities within and beyond the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and suggests possible ways ahead."
"August 05, 2009","Although children constitute half of the world's refugee population, the long-term future of refugee children still does not receive sufficient attention in the general debate on the refugee issue, and in particular on so-called durable solutions. The positive impact of the successful integration and assimilation in the past of millions and millions of refugees is largely discarded as irrelevant under “today's changed conditions”. Equally ignored are the lessons that should have been learned from having allowed during the last 60 years millions and millions of generations of children to be born and raised as refugees with the only future promised to them being a “return” to the past. The conclusion of the present article is that refugee children represent a tremendous potential for the good and also for future crises and suffering. Thus, one of the principal litmus tests of the quality of refugee policies should be: “What do they do for the long-term future of refugee children?”"
"August 05, 2009","The use of child soldiers in armed conflicts is qualified as one of the worst forms of child labour and concerns up to 300,000 individuals under the age of 18 years, some of whom are much younger. Mostly they are in developing countries with the situation being worse in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of contemporary armed conflicts are raging. The phenomenon is not recent, but has nevertheless increased with the end of the Cold War and the multiplication of intra-state conflicts. International legal standards have been developed over the past 30 years. The difficulties in implementing them are due to the fact that, in most cases, child soldiers are present in the context of failed states, of internal conflicts, non-state actors, paramilitary organizations, organized crime, minorities and vulnerable groups, and/or mobile or displaced populations. This article attempts to list the main causes of the recruitment and use of child soldiers and suggests long-term cooperation and development as more effective approaches than the present disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programmes."
"July 29, 2009","Peace accords usually involve top politicians and military leaders, who negotiate, sign, and/or benefit from an agreement. What is conspicuously absent from such negotiations is broad-based participation by those who should benefit in the first place: citizens. More specifically, the local level of security provision and insecurity production is rarely taken into account. The analysis of recent African peace agreements shows important variations in power-sharing devices and why it is important to ask who is sharing power with whom. Experiences with power sharing are mixed and far less positive than assumed by outside negotiators."
"July 26, 2009","This is the fourth and final article of a series of four articles describing the evaluation results for Hawaii’s mandatory Court-Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP), a program with a jurisdictional limit $150,000, much higher than most other state programs. This evaluation examines the effectiveness of Hawaii's Court Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP), which is a mandatory, non-binding procedure for tort cases valued at $150,000 or less. The major goals of the program are to reduce litigant costs, reduce time to disposition, and improve or maintain the level of satisfaction for litigants and attorneys. Hawaii's Court-Annexed Arbitration Program has reduced pretrial discovery; reduced litigation costs for private litigants, increased the pace of litigation, provided litigants with a fair, just, and satisfactory 'day-in-court,' encouraged early and less expensive settlements, increased the percentage of cases that terminate each year, and may have reduced the number of trials. Through comparison of cases randomly assigned to CAAP to those cases that went through traditional litigation, the study found that under the arbitration program, the average plaintiff saves $496 in discovery expenses, and the average defendant saves $266. Lawyers' fees are on average $159 less per defendant whose case is sent to arbitration. CAAP cases also experience quicker disposition times, reaching disposition almost four months earlier than non-CAAP cases. Most lawyers who participated in the program were satisfied with the program and with the arbitrators."
"July 26, 2009","This article investigates both, the primordialist arguments of ethnicity as well as the modernist arguments of civil divergences as possible explanations in trying to understand the violent conflicts in the Western Balkan case. I argue that ethnic heterogeneity and legacies of the past (primordialist arguments) may favour conflicts but they are not sufficient enough for bursting up a conflict. In the Western Balkans the violent conflicts have been first and foremost a result of the improper relations of state-citizens which brought a societal security dilemma resulting many times into violent conflicts for the whole of the community."
"July 26, 2009","This is the third of a series of four articles describing the evaluation results for Hawaii’s mandatory Court-Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP), a program with a $150,000 jurisdictional limit. The article reports on survey data from over 600 returned surveys from lawyers in CAAP cases. The evaluation was focused on the litigation costs, pace of litigation and satisfaction of the participants because these factors reflect the goals of CAAP.  The survey results might be very useful for other states considering using an arbitration program with a high jurisdictional limit. The article reports on lawyers’ opinions about pretrial discovery reduction, discovery costs, the pace of litigation, satisfaction with the program, arbitrator workload, arbitrator fairness, case value and complexity, and looks at differences in lawyers’ opinions depending upon whether the lawyers used contingency or hourly fees. Because most court-annexed arbitration program have much lower jurisdictional limits, the article also examines the survey results by case value – looking responses for cases valued up to $15,000, from $15,001 to $50,000, and at $50,001 and above."
"July 26, 2009","Using a new set of indicators that measure the Property Insecurity of ethnopolitical minority groups, I find that Property Insecurity is not correlated with the Risk of Expropriation facing foreign investors and domestic elites – revealing that the aggregate measures of 'institutional quality' broadly used in the cross-country empirical development literature proxy only limited dimensions of the institutions being measured.   Existing widely used Risk of Expropriation indicators, initially designed to assess the security of property rights faced by foreign investors, are relevant to the experiences of elites but fail to adequately incorporate the perspective of marginalized minority groups – so do not reflect the risk of expropriation faced by a country’s population more broadly.  It has been widely argued that secure private property rights are a prerequisite for economic development.  This article demonstrates that it fundamentally matters whose property rights are secure.  I find that Property Insecurity of ethnopolitical minorities does not reduce growth in either the short or long term; that the severity of Property Insecurity for the worst-off group in a country is strongly related to the onset of armed conflict; and that controlling for civil war, Property Insecurity is associated with higher growth.  Economic growth can occur when the property rights of elites are secure but marginalized minorities face high a risk of expropriation, because land is reallocated into the hands of investors with access to capital.  However, the potentially growth enhancing effect of forced displacement and resettlement is mitigated because the property insecurity of minorities is also correlated with conflict, which reduces growth."

"July 23, 2009","Considerable attention has been focussed on the difficulties posed by Antarctic claimants seeking to realise coastal state rights in the extended continental shelf appurtenant to claimed territories pursuant to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Those claimants that have so far made submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) have each in some manner shown sensitivity towards the unique legal and geopolitical realities surrounding the question of Antarctic territorial claims. By comparison, little attention has been focussed on the subantarctic islands north of the Antarctic Treaty Area, that is beyond 60 degree south latitude. These islands, aside from the South Georgia and South Sandwich groups which are subject to a broader dispute, appear to be regarded as unproblematic. However, as the largely successful submission by Australia to the CLCS indicates, CLCS recommendations in relation to subantarctic islands may result in substantial extended continental shelf (ECS) penetration into the Antarctic Treaty Area. This situation raises interesting questions in relation to the established collective management of the Antarctic. For the first time there appears to be an objective international assignation (via UNCLOS and the CLCS process) of individual state rights to areas within the Antarctic Treaty Area. Whereas claimed territory within the Antarctic Treaty Area remains 'frozen' territory beyond the Antarctic may now be seen to generate preclusive rights within it. This, perhaps unanticipated Antarctic paradox, is the focus of this article."
"July 23, 2009","Advocates of the proposed United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) promise that it will prevent the flow of arms to human rights violators. This Article first examines the ATT, and observes that the ATT, if implemented as promised, would require dozens of additional arms embargoes, including embargoes on much of Africa. The Article then provides case studies of the current supply of arms to the dictatorship in Zimbabwe and to the warlords in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Article argues that the ATT would do nothing to remediate the conditions which have allowed so many arms to be acquired by human rights violators. The ATT would have no more effective force than the embargoes that are already imposed by the UN Security Council; therefore states, including China, which violate current Security Council embargoes could just as well violate ATT embargoes. Accordingly, the ATT is a distraction, and human rights activists should instead examine alternative methods of addressing the problem of arms in the hands of human rights violators."
"July 23, 2009","This article casts light on the international law aspects of a largely unrecognized occurrence in armed conflict: sexual violence against men.  The article discusses causes and consequences of such violence, and assesses pertinent aspects of international law.  The article argues that, to reduce and prevent sexual violence against men in conflict settings, international law should be interpreted, applied, and enforced in ways that delegitimize the prejudicial and discriminatory conceptions of gender, sex, and (homo)sexuality that often fuel such violence in the first place.  Toward this aim, the article highlights why it is necessary to use a definition of sexual violence that encompasses, among other things, violence targeting an individual's imputed, perceived, or actual sexuality.  In addition, the article provides a prosecution roadmap, sketching the conventional and jurisprudential standards for sexual violence to be prosecuted as a constituent element of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  The article concludes by suggesting two additional ways to enhance protection: treaty drafters should explicitly recognize men as a class of victims, and a postulated jus cogens norm should be expanded to include all forms of sexual violence against men, women, and children."
"July 22, 2009","This chapter investigates how economic diplomacy can be used to generate and increase economic security. The first section sets out a definition for economic diplomacy, uncovers some of the historical roots and discusses empirical findings on the trade - conflict - cooperation relationships. The second section deals with the impact of the process of globalisation and its relevance for economic diplomacy and commercial policy. In particular we investigate whether the scope and efficacy of public activities have been influenced by the assumed reduction of distance as a barrier to trade. The third section focuses on new dimensions of and recent trends in (the use of) economic diplomacy. We will pay special attention to the emergence of new actors in the global game and will analyse how this alters the rules of the game. The fourth section deals with the requirements of economic security and discusses the issue of energy security as a special case. The final section draws conclusions and identifies issues for further research."
"July 22, 2009","This article explores the position of law vis-à-vis the complex phenomenon of globalization. It begins by defining globalization as the change brought about by the onset of market economy and by the technological revolution of the twentieth century. The article goes on to sketch a short history of the institutions which globalization has had the greatest destabilizing impact on: the national State and - for civil law jurisdictions - codifications. The declining role of States (and their codes) is then presented as the main reason for the enhanced importance of lex mercatoria in regulating international exchanges. This change translates, in practice, in the increased need for the expertise of jurists. In fact, the latter are the only keepers of that body of legal knowledge necessary to regulate economic transactions. Thanks to their specialized education, they have therefore come to supplement the deficiency of State institutions and legislation in providing certainty to the globalized economy."
"July 22, 2009","This article analyses the accusations that have emerged since 2001 of predatory behaviour during the presidency of Frederick T. Chiluba (1991-2001). It advocates a detailed analysis of the practices that have come to light in order to move beyond a generalized interpretation of the persistence of predatory elites in Africa. Three specific themes appear. First, there is a danger of oversimplification of these conflicts as between the international community and national governments. The political struggles tend to be more complicated than generally presented, and international involvement meshes with local political struggles. Second, predatory behaviour or corruption is a social process that is embedded in wider national and international networks. It is therefore difficult to locate culpability exactly in clearly designated protagonists. Third, there is a danger of imputing an economic and political rationality to this behaviour which may best be designated as theft. The overall theme of the article is that there are important national cultural influences in the way these predatory practices are dealt with. These are obfuscated by a blander critique identifying partial reform that leaves predatory elites untouched."
"July 21, 2009","The creation of a new national defence force in South Africa produced ex-combatants - a social group possessing military skills and access to small arms but without opportunities to exercise their skills. Since 2000, former combatants from various military backgrounds have participated in or planned protest action to demand jobs or integration into the national defence force. To date there has been no scholarly attempt to explain the sporadic protest action by former combatants in South Africa. The purpose of this article is to account for the various protest actions by former combatants since 2000. The main argument is that many former combatants who were unable to make careers in the post-apartheid national defence force have failed to reintegrate successfully into civilian society. Consequently, some of them have mobilized to highlight their grievances. While there is nothing inherently wrong with peaceful protest action, the easy access to small arms in South Africa increases the potential for violent conflict."

"July 21, 2009","The 2005 elections were the first Liberian elections in over a century in which the political environment was controlled neither by the settler oligarchy nor, latterly, by the dictators Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor. Observers feared that the post-conflict environment was not conducive to holding elections and that a serious programme of reconciliation and constitutional reform should have preceded them. Nevertheless, elections were conducted with some degree of success, providing an opportunity to identify some emerging patterns in post-conflict Liberian politics. This article assesses some of the new or hitherto dormant institutions and processes that are likely to play a significant role in shaping Liberia's political order in the twenty-first century."
"July 21, 2009","This article examines a neglected pattern of the regional crisis in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic: the cross-border activities of combatants with fluid loyalties. The trajectories of Chadian ‘ex-liberators’ in CAR, which have been little documented, are used to illustrate the regional movements of armed men. The article explains how unemployed Chadian soldiers were recruited to fight with François Bozizé in CAR and why many of them joined other armed groups after Bozizé's takeover. The reconversions of armed combatants, who may easily shift allegiance and cross borders to carry on with their ‘politico-military careers’, is thus a structural characteristic of the current conflict, which has major implications both at the local and transnational levels. The article concludes that freelance military entrepreneurs’ trajectories are crucial in understanding the unfolding of this regional crisis."
"July 21, 2009","Against the background of recent attempts to explain insurgency in the Niger Delta in the context of the “greed” of militant groups, this article argues that insurgency can best be explained by examining the social origins of militant groups. Focusing on the case of the Ijaw of Warri, from among whom the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) emerged, the article seeks to demonstrate that insurgency is the consequence of longstanding experiences of political and social-cultural marginalization. Militant groups emerged as a result of the failure of the state and oil companies to respond to peaceful protests in previous decades."
"July 21, 2009","Peace-building NGOs are frequently at work along the Kenya-Uganda border. But in this desolate region, results have been extremely sparse. This article contends that this is due to the inadequacies of contemporary understandings of cattle raiding. Most NGOs and many academics ascribe cattle raids to a familiar array of factors such as resource scarcity, small arms proliferation, and generational conflict. While each issue is obviously of some relevance, such explanations are too cumbersome to really enhance our knowledge of cattle raiding. This article proposes a new approach to the problem by utilizing popular conceptions of ethnicity and criminal responsibility for raids. Given that most major raids originally stem from seemingly insignificant thefts, the process of retaliation is seen as crucial to understanding why violence escalates in certain situations and defuses in others. The failure of NGOs engaged in peace work to address this important issue in a meaningful way is the reason they have failed to achieve much success along the Kenya-Uganda border. This is in turn responsible for the widespread cynicism and corruption that has crept into their work, and is the subject of the second part of this article."
"July 21, 2009","Peace work is big business along the Kenya-Uganda border. Each year, new groups are created thanks to the generosity of major donors while others disappear due to corruption and mismanagement. This cycle has continued for decades and, despite an absence of tangible results, millions of dollars continue to flow into the bank accounts of peace groups in the North Rift. As the first part of this article suggests, the focus on the so-called ‘root causes’ of violence may well be responsible for the dismal performance of the peace industry. However, the behaviour of peace NGOs in the field has been appalling. Peace meetings are often only held so NGOs can display an engagement with the conflict, despite the dangers created by such events. Other groups are dominated by politicians who use money earmarked for peace work to fund their political ambitions. Better monitoring is the obvious solution, but local groups have been able to avoid this by exaggerating the security risks of visiting the region. Others argue that offloading peace work responsibilities to CBOs might lead to better results, but in the highly ethnicized North Rift smaller groups are rarely able to transcend their local roots. This article concludes that the peace industry is deeply flawed, and requires a complete overhaul in order to have a beneficial impact on the region."
"July 21, 2009","This article is an adapted, narrative version of an expert witness report the author wrote for the Defence of one of the accused before the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The case against the Civil Defence Forces militia was predicated in part on the argument that the CDF was a military organization with military-style command and control. Based on a close reading of the Prosecution's military expert witness report and the author's ethnographic research with the militia, the article outlines a case for understanding the CDF as the militarization of a social network rather than as a military organization. This framing has implications not only for post-conflict adjudication, but for how we think about and intervene in violent contexts throughout contemporary West Africa."
"July 21, 2009","The Abyei Area, straddling the North-South border of Sudan, was the subject of a separate protocol in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed between the Sudan government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in January 2005. One provision of that protocol was the establishment of a boundaries commission to define the territory to be included in the special administration of the area. The commission's decision was to be implemented ‘with immediate effect’ on the submission of its report in July 2005, but implementation has been blocked by the National Congress Party, which still controls the central government in Sudan. The conduct of war in Abyei established many precedents for the conduct of war in Darfur in the use of tribal militias and the forcible displacement of non-Arab peoples. The failure to implement the Abyei Protocol has implications not only for determining the North-South border (as stipulated by the CPA), but for the implementation of any Darfur peace agreement."
"July 20, 2009","This article concerns the conditions of knowledge production involved in a study of child trafficking in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It describes the complexities of 'capacity building' projects, social research in post-communist countries, and relationships between ethnographers and their interlocutors in situations cross-cut by global inequalities and language differences."
"July 18, 2009","The past several decades have seen a Copernican shift in the paradigm of armed conflict, which the traditional Law of International Armed Conflict (LOIAC) canon has not fully matched.  Standing out in stark relief against the backdrop of relative inactivity in LOIAC, is the surfeit of activity in the field of international human rights law, which has become a dramatic new force in the ancient realm of international law. Human rights law, heretofore not formally part of the traditional juridico-military calculus, has gained ever increasing salience in that calculus. Indeed, human rights law has ramified in such a manner that – given the nature of contemporary conflict, it is no longer possible to address one body of law without also dealing with the other. This has been the most dramatic trend for LOIAC in the last decade.  It will doubtlessly continue."
"July 18, 2009","This paper goes beyond commonly invoked macro-political explanations for conflict-related migration, offering a micro-analysis of the causes and processes of flight from Mogadishu in the last two years. It explores how particular interactions between people, their resources, and their structural contexts produce migration, and shape the process of migration. Based on qualitative research with people from Mogadishu seeking refuge in self-declared Somaliland, the paper illuminates some of the micro-level, human consequences of the ‘war on terror’ in the Somali regions."
"July 17, 2009","Both within and across countries, most attention has been devoted to measuring inequality among individuals (and globally countries). Within countries, increasing evidence shows that inequalities among groups (HIs) are important for wellbeing. However, the global component of HIs are generally neglected. The paper argues that HIs at a global level may also be important for world stability and wellbeing, in much the same way HIs are relevant at the national level. With this perspective, the paper reviews Muslim/ non-Muslim HIs within developed and developing countries, and between Muslim and non-Muslim countries, finding that Muslims are systematically disadvantaged across many dimensions. It argues that, despite much heterogeneity among the Muslim population, there is evidence of multiple global connections and of shared perceptions, such that inequalities faced by Muslims in one part of the world may become a source of grievance and potential mobilisation in other parts of the world. Consequently, socio-economic and political inequalities need to be addressed globally, within countries and between them, and politically as well as with respect to socio-economic and cultural status."
"July 16, 2009","Unlike the Cold War period, in the post-Cold War era, there has been an inclination toward having an independent and active foreign policy from the regional power centres. By introducing a new power category in international politics, the pivotal middle power, this study argues that pivotal middle powers can play critical roles in establishing a new global world order, if they can act together in global politics focusing on case-to-case approach, in other words, niche diplomacy. Recently, the New Agenda Coalition (NAC) and India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA) have been the two examples of the niche approach from pivotal middle powers. The new activism of pivotal middle powers in post-Cold War global politics can be located in globalization and global world order context and in future, if successful, such initiatives could pave the way a new understanding of global politics especially with regard to economic and security issues."
"July 14, 2009","Using panel data for a maximum of 109 countries over the years 1976-2000, we empirically analyze the impact of decentralization on the occurrence of transnational terror. Our results show that expenditure decentralization reduces the number of transnational terror events in a country, while political decentralization has no impact. These results are robust to the choice of control variables and method of estimation."
"July 13, 2009","International investment and international investment agreements have experienced a particular level of growth in the past few decades.  With that growth and the granting of affirmative dispute resolution rights to foreign investors, international investment conflict has become increasingly highlighted; and one particular methodology - namely investment treaty arbitration - has become particularly visible.  Reliance on this single option for resolving conflict has a unique set of systemic implications.  This chapter therefore takes a more systemic look at investment treaty conflict and, in an effort to provide an appropriate historical and doctrinal framework, approaches to dispute resolution broadly.  It asks for a reconsideration of Appropriate Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods for resolving investment treaty conflict and highlights the costs and benefits of particularized dispute resolution methods, including preventative, negotiated, facilitated, fact-finding, advisory and imposed ADR  mechanisms.  The chapter ultimately argues that, while arbitration has utility, the challenge for the future will be to move beyond investment treaty arbitration to a more holistic approach to conflict management that considers other opportunities, particularly the collaborative design of sustainable dispute resolution systems."
"July 13, 2009","A fairly common premise in academic research is that the State of Israel expropriated large tracts of land from its Arab citizens. This premise does not distinguish between the taking of property which was expropriated from Arab refugees during the War of Independence and the expropriation of land “in the regular course of business”. This research attempted to isolate and clarify the extent of the ""regular"" expropriations that has been held on the national level according to the Lands (Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance 1943 which is the main permanent tool for large scale expropriations in Israel. It shows that the common premise about Arab land expropriation is highly exaggerated. The Arab population’s share in the burden of expropriation was fairly small in absolute terms and was not significantly greater than the share of the Jewish population. A mere quantitative analysis of the expropriations cannot in itself produce a conclusion about harmful and unjustified influence of the expropriations on Arab citizens. While a qualitative analysis of each expropriation may possibly produce such conclusion, arguing against every expropriation of land which results in the transfer of resources from Arabs to Jews, may entails an a priori negation of the Jewish character of the State rather than legitimate criticism on the merits of each expropriation."
"July 05, 2009","Both policy-makers and scholars have turned their attention to federalism - or decentralized governance - as a means for managing conflict between central governments and sub-national groups as well as conflict among sub-national groups themselves. Both the theoretical literature and the empirical track record of federations point to federalism’s ability to manage conflicts of diversity and preserve peace. More particularly, multi-national federalism has considerable, albeit critical support, among contemporary academics (Hechter 2000, Linz 1997, Keating 2001, Kymlicka, 1998, Kymlicka 2001, Moore 2001, Stepan 1999, Watts 1999, McGarry and O’Leary 1993, O’Leary 2001).This paper argues that multi-national federalism is the sure way to peace and development in Ethiopia, as it is the only way to manage the Ethiopian ethnic diversity peacefully, democratically and respectfully. The paper attempts to explore the evolution of Ethiopian multi-national federation against the back drop of its recent political and legal history. Given its history of gross and systematic group domination and discrimination (ethnic, religious, linguistic, etc.), the adoption of a multi-national federation is not a luxury that Ethiopia can afford but a necessity. The adoption of a multi-national federation was necessitated by the urgency and intensity of the need to address the claims of the country’s ethnic groups of historic discrimination and inequality, and to build a multi-national democracy. The multi-national nature of the new Ethiopian federation can be gathered from the following three sites.  First, the 1995 Federal constitution vests sovereign powers with the nations, nationalities, and peoples of the country (Article 8). Second, the Federal constitution entitles the nations, nationalities, and peoples the right to self-determination including and up to secession (Article 39). Third, all Ethiopia’s nations, nationalities, and peoples have equal representation in the House of Federation (HoF), which is vested with the ultimate power to interpret the constitution (Article 39 cum 61-62). The paper aims to explore the institutions, policies, and practices of conflict management in the context of Ethiopian multi-national federation."
"June 30, 2009","This essay argues that the study of international relations is secularized due to the secularizing character of its founding event, the Peace of Westphalia.  But today, religion has entered back into the actual conduct of international relations, thereby calling for an accommodating revision of international relations theory."
"June 29, 2009","In early 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia (TRC) released the first volume of its final report. The report claims that the root causes of the civil war that devastated Liberia between 1989 and 2003 were poverty, corruption, and inequality. Despite this diagnosis, the Commission’s legal analysis of past abuses barely touches upon violations of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR). Likewise, many transitional justice processes around the world sideline considerations of ESCR. This article, based on an analysis of the first volume of the final report of the TRC of Liberia, outlines why violations of ESCR should be addressed by transitional justice processes. This paper also provides recommendations for the final two volumes of the report, to be issued in June 2009."
"June 24, 2009","This article is a response to an article published in the UCLA Law Review by John Yoo and Glen Sulmasy which argued that the military lawyers violated the principle of civilian control of the military when they disagreed with some of the Bush administration's policies in fighting the War on Terror.  In this article, I will first show how Sulmasy and Yoo's view of civilian control of the military is a narrow, inaccurate reflection of the principle. I suggest that when Sulmasy and Yoo refer to civilian control of the military, what they are really arguing for is politicization of the military by one branch of government. Such a narrow view of civilian control of the military is without historical precedent and is, in fact, antithetical to our constitutional structure.  In suggesting a more limited role for uniformed lawyers, Sulmasy and Yoo contend that the Global War on Terror is so different from wars of the past that many of the traditional legal norms do not apply.  The refrain, 'the events of September 11th changed everything,' has been a constant theme by Bush administration officials to justify any number of actions. While this refrain has been constant, I suggest that both the applicability of the laws of war and the role for military lawyers - with unique expertise in the development and implementation of these laws - are still critical aspects of the War on Terror.  This article suggests a more accurate explanation for why military lawyers were opposed to many of the Bush administration's proposals related to the treatment of detainees.  Finally, this article will discuss the ethical obligations of military and other government lawyers, a matter not discussed by Sulmasy and Yoo."
"June 22, 2009","The bilateral relations between Portugal and China have been influenced by the regional bet of both nations: Portugal's full integration in the European Union; China's recent effort to further a economic integration of East Asia and South Asia around the concept of ASEAN Plus something. These intraregional and separated agendas made Sino-Portuguese Relations aleatory, unsystematic and diffuse. This gentle but non-substantial relationship is expected to continue in the next years, although the political rhetoric both from China and Portugal point the other direction."
"June 11, 2009","The question of Sexual violence is a very critical issue in the context of Armed Conflicts. Belligerents use this form of violence as a weapon or strategy of war. This practice has incited much indignation in the world opinion, but much has not been done to bring perpetrators face justice despite the adoption of Security Council 1820. United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UNPKOs) are established in order to assist states and populations recover from the trauma of conflicts and set foundations for effective peace-building. Peacekeepers, always viewed as virtuous soldiers, built on the respect of norms and principles of humanity; that is reason why they constitute an assured refuge and protection for traumatized populations. To achieve this task, they are vested with some privileges and immunities, but these powers led sneaked into abuses and exploitation of civilians under peacekeepers’ protection. Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) appears in the forms of ‘sex for food’, ‘sex for money’, ‘sex for job’ or any other type of transaction in exchange of sexual favors. The Standards of the United Nations prevent any type of exploitation or abuse of human being, especially those having a sexual connotation. This paper is an analysis of SEA committed by United Nations Peacekeepers, surrounding factors, and the impact they cast upon international peacemaking efforts."
"May 17, 2009","Crime, violence, and insecurity are perceived as society's biggest problems in contemporary Costa Rica. This degree of priority is especially remarkable because the country has always been considered the peaceful exception in the violent Central American region. In this paper I analyze four cornerstones of the nonviolent national self-perception in the 1940s and 1980s as the fundamental basis for the current talk of crime: the civil war, the abolition of the military, the proclamation of neutrality, and the peace plan for Central America and the subsequent granting of the Nobel Peace Prize. The result of the analysis is the determination that these historical cornerstones were not publicly discussed as expressions of the nonviolent identity for which they are today cited as evidence."
"May 14, 2009","Introduction: The Roman whom Gibbon called “a philosophical historian, whose writings will instruct the last generations of mankind,” is known for the grace of his speech. We are surprised, then, when Tacitus claims in his Agricola to speak to us with a “disorderly and rude voice.”  Even at first hearing we hardly believe him. We find nothing disorganized or coarse about the work, which relates the life of one Agricola, Roman governor of Britain and Tacitus’ own father-in-law. Indeed, his tone is elevated. How, then, do we understand Tacitus’ claim? Is it a mere gesture of modesty? The location of his seemingly self-deprecating remark may be of interest. Tacitus, who has also been called a “historian of evil,” is recognized by his narrations primarily of tyrannies—of the corruption and wantonness of the emperors, of, to say the least, the unpleasant things. But his early Agricola is unique among his writings as a record devoted almost entirely to the virtuous acts of a virtuous man. Some examination of it in relation to his later works is therefore in order."
"May 12, 2009","In 2007, on a net basis, the United States imported 58 percent of the oil it consumed. This book critically evaluates commonly suggested links between these oil imports and U.S. national security. The major risk to the United States posed by reliance on oil is the economic costs of a major disruption in global oil supplies. On the other hand, the study found no evidence that oil exporters have been able to use embargoes or threats of embargoes to achieve key political and foreign policy goals. Oil revenues are irrelevant for terrorist groups' ability to launch attacks. The study also assesses the economic, political, and military costs and benefits of potential policies to alleviate challenges to U.S. national security linked to imported oil."
"May 09, 2009","A striking result in the literature analyzing the roots of terrorism is Abadie’s (2006) finding that political freedom tends to affect terrorism in a non-monotonic way. Terrorism tends to rise with freedom starting from low levels, and declines at relatively high levels of freedom. With the availability of new data that allows us to separate domestic and transnational terrorism incidents, we can analyze the two types of terrorism separately. This is important, because domestic and transnational terrorism, can, in principle, be driven by different factors. We find that while political freedom has a significant and non-linear effect on domestic terrorism, it has no significant effect on transnational terrorism. Given that domestic terrorism constitutes a large share of total terrorism, the non-linear relationship continues to be important. However, we cannot base policies targeted toward transnational terrorism on it. While geography and fractionalization may limit a county’s ability to curb terrorism, the presence of strong legal institutions deters it. Consistent with previous findings, GDP per capita is not significant in most specifications."
"May 08, 2009","A universal and comprehensive definition of direct participation in hostilities (DPH) does not exist.  Furthermore, modern warfare’s tendency to blur the distinction between combatant and civilian necessitates some revision of DPH.  However, States have incentives to pursue narrow or broad interpretations of DPH, or even both.  These contradictory strategies create a dilemma for policymakers who seek to revise the concept of DPH.  Any revision is likely to put some group of individuals at risk; there is not a simple answer to the question of how best to revise DPH.  Instead, a radical revision of DPH is needed.  This report will briefly examine the law of war and then explore the relative merits of the U.S., Israeli, and the International Committee of the Red Cross’s interpretations of DPH.  Lastly, this report will recommend potential solutions to the dilemma of DPH interpretation, most notably a membership-based approach."
"May 06, 2009","The article ""The Insignificance of the Liberal Peace"" was written as part of a friendly scholarly debate with Michael Doyle, who had written a seminal work on the topic.  Bruce Russett had also written a piece on the topic, and asked to respond to the article in a later edition of International Security.  This was part of the ensuing correspondence that the journal published."
"May 06, 2009","This article challenges ""The Liberal Peace"" described in work by Michael Doyle from three standpoints.  First, it questions whether the statistical tests (which were performed and published by scholars other than Doyle) actually test any coherent theory of peace or conflict.  Second, it questions whether the data sets used are valid proxies for the variables they are meant to represent.  Third it questions the methods used and the results obtained.  The article argues that there may a lower expectancy of conflict among Liberal republics, as Kant argued, modern literature focusing on statistics does not confirm it - it does not really test it.  It also argues that there is probably a good reason we have observed a peace among Western democracies since WWII, and this reason may be found in shared values that led them to join the NATO alliance.  The simple implementation of a democratic form of government does not prevent nations from making war on one another."
"May 04, 2009","On April 27, 2007, Estonia suffered a crippling cyber attack launched from outside its borders.  It is still unclear what legal rights a state has as a victim of a cyber attack. For example, even if Estonia could conclusively prove that Russia was  behind the March 2007 attack there is no clear consensus on how Estonia could legally respond, whether with  armed force, its own cyber attack, or some other measure. The scholarly literature dealing with these questions, as well as the ethical, humanitarian, and human rights implications of information warfare (IW) on national and international security is scarce. Treatments of IW outside the orthodox international humanitarian law (IHL) framework are nearly non-existent. This underscores the tension between classifying cyber attacks as merely criminal, or as a matter of state survival calling for the same responses as conventional threats to national security."
"May 02, 2009","In over seventy-six years of election history in Nigeria, the country is yet to conduct an election that has not been contested. It does appear that the level of animosity that is exhibited during political activities is so high that most participants refuse to accept that someone must win while another loses. The culture has since evolved in Nigeria that politicians tend to assume that it was natural to win by all means and allow the other party contest the outcome at the courts. This attitude is reflected in the number of pre-election disputes that have come up and remain in litigation even after the elected and sworn party had exhausted tenure."
"May 01, 2009","A rare bipartisan consensus among US leaders identifies nuclear and radiological (NR) terrorism as the greatest threat to national security. Although terrorists have yet to acquire or detonate nuclear weapons, an alarming number of other types of NR terrorism incidents occurred in many countries in recent decades. Surprisingly, there is little systematic statistical analysis of the causes of these NR terrorist events. Our research fills this important gap. We argue that an important but overlooked determinant of NR terrorism is the size of a country’s civil and military nuclear programs for several theoretical reasons. We conduct the first systematic analysis of NR terrorism incidents that occurred between 1992 and 2006. Our findings not only support our theoretical expectation but are also arguably quite provocative. Civilian and military nuclear programs swamp most other commonly perceived sources of NR terrorism. Corruption has little effect on NR terrorism, contrary to conventional wisdom. The US and Russia experience a large number of NR terrorism incidents because of their exceedingly large civilian and military nuclear programs. Civilian and military nuclear programs have little impact on chemical and biological (CB) terrorism. These findings bring to light a serious tradeoff between nuclear programs and the prevention of NR terrorism."
"April 29, 2009","We continue to live in a dangerous world. We are exposed to the risk that hostile states or terrorist groups with global reach might attack our civilian population or those of our allies using weapons of mass destruction. In such circumstances, it might seem natural for U.S. policymakers to consider preventive war as a possible tool for countering such threats. Yet in the current climate of opinion, such thinking would be controversial - in large part, no doubt, because of the continuing disputes over the normative, strategic, and legal wisdom of what has been called the “Bush Doctrine.”"
"April 28, 2009","Chapter I: Introduction"
"April 28, 2009","This article discusses disclosure rules that must be followed by a company undertaking an equity offering in a world of interacting securities markets, in light of theoretical predictions and empirical data. It aims at making a contribution by providing a brief survey and analysis of the relevant issues. Several new study methodologies are applied in this article. To understand the securities market, this article agrees that the question should be analyzed in terms of the broadly accepted principles of modern financial economics, as most of the previous literatures did. Then, this article will go beyond economic theory and make a particular analysis from a perspective of international law. This article examines the internationalization of the securities market in a larger environment - globalization. Comparison between the international securities market and other comparatively more harmonized areas may make some sense. Most of the existing literature was written by scholars from developed countries especially the United States, while this article would like to stand on the developing country’s point of view, taking China as an example for exploration. China is the central reference case in this article. The robust debate over recent years concerning the evolution and best-model regulation of securities markets has largely ignored the important case of China. The Chinese stock market deserves international attention since China is different from any western country, even its East Asian neighboring countries. Therefore China’s case provides us with an opportunity to view the international harmonization efforts towards disclosure rules for cross-border securities offerings from a different perspective. This article focuses on China here as an example of a country with an emerging market and different culture in the interacting world of securities markets."
"April 28, 2009","In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), there is a vast and sprawling marketplace that sprang up just as the peace accords were going into effect, bringing to some conclusion three and a half years of bloody ethnic fighting. The place is called Arizona Market and it was said by some to be a shining example of capitalism, evidence of the positive impact of the particular type of political and economic engineering that takes place in the reconstruction after a war. But the narratives about what Arizona Market truly represents abound to a degree which belies the facts that the market is a mere thirty-five acres in size, a mere thirteen years old and host to thousands of flea market stalls. There are narratives which call Arizona Market a success and others which reveal the market as a clear example of cocksure neo-liberal wrongheadedness. There are myths about the ability of a market to bring about peaceful relations between warring ethnicities through the neutrality of commerce, even where peace was hard to come by in the rest of Bosnia. The narratives surrounding Arizona Market are conflicting, and they all hold some truth. It was a place to buy bread when there was no bread to be found, but it was also a place to buy human beings to satisfy sexual appetites. It remains a dark place, laden with black market activity and organized crime, even while its taxation has funded the shining democratic success story of the town of Brcko, in whose shadow Arizona Market sits."
"April 27, 2009","The analysis of causal relationship between GDP growth and military spending received considerable attention. Using cross-sectional, time-series and panel type analysis, consensus is yet to be reached about the existence of the relationship as well as the type of effect. Causality studies fall short of establishing general results as well. These mixed findings are due primarily to differences in data, countries, time periods and econometric methods. This study employs a Granger type causality analysis for 65 countries for the period between 1975 and 2004. Vector autoregressive estimation with the panel data provides general results for the overall sample. Each country is evaluated individually for stationarity and special emphasis is on the structural breaks and the time trends. Omitting structural changes in the variables can result in a bias which would lead to rejecting stationarity for stationary variables. Omitting time trend can also result in a bias which would lead to concluding difference stationarity for trend stationary variables. We use four variables namely GDP, military spending, government size and openness. Estimation, based on the whole sample, provides evidence of bi-directional positive causal relationship. For further analysis of possible factors influencing the causality, we initially control for any military disputes during 1975-2004. The results are unchanged. Then, the VAR model with military dispute dummy variable is estimated for countries; 1) where there is mandatory military service, 2) that are members of NATO and 3) where terrorist attacks with fatality are frequent. In each case we compare the results to the rest of the sample. We find that, military spending does not cause GDP growth, for countries in which there is mandatory military service, for NATO member countries and for countries where terrorism is an above average concern. We also find that, GDP growth does not cause military spending, for countries in which there is no mandatory military service and for countries where terrorism is an above average concern. Therefore, mandatory military service, NATO membership and high level of terrorism are factors that influence the causal relationship between military spending and GDP growth."
"April 27, 2009","The causal relationship between GDP growth and military spending is a long lasting debate. Earlier studies employing cross-sectional, pooled or fixed effects panel data, report mixed findings. More recent studies employing causality tests also find mixed results. We argue that structural changes in data (i.e. significant economic or military events) play an important role and should not be ignored. We also argue that treatment of stationarity around mean and around time trend needs special attention. Structural changes, if ignored, have the potential to render long-run tests through VECM biased. Mistreatment of trend stationarity may result in spurious results. With a sample of 65 countries, for the time period between 1975 and 2004, we analyze the relationship between military spending and GDP growth with special emphasis to structural change and stationarity around time trend. For the Granger causation through VAR, we test GDP, military spending, government size and openness for stationarity around mean and around time trend using augmented Dickey-Fuller (GLS) test. While trend stationarity is a common trait of the variables, we also find that there are structural changes in the variables' time trends. Considering the bias towards rejecting stationarity in the presence of structural changes, we also employ Zivot-Andrews unit root test. We find causal relationship between military spending and GDP growth for 54 (of the 65) countries. Based on this evidence, we estimate panel VAR estimation for Granger causation for the entire sample and find bi-directional positive causal relationship."
"April 25, 2009","This paper presents a model where foreign aid bolsters a developing country’s proactive counterterrorism efforts against a resident transnational terrorist group. In stage 1 of the game, the donor country allocates resources to terrorism-fighting tied aid, general assistance, and defensive actions at home. The recipient country then decides its proactive campaign against the common terrorist threat in stage 2, while the terrorists direct their attacks against the donor and recipient countries in stage 3. Terrorists’ choices in the final stage provide a solid microfoundation for the terrorists’ likelihood of success function. In stage 2, greater tied aid raises the recipient country’s proactive measures and regime instability, while increased general aid reduces these proactive efforts and regime instability. In stage 1, a donor’s homeland security decisions are interdependent with its aid package to a recipient country, hosting resident transnational terrorists. This interdependency has gone unrecognized to date."
"April 24, 2009","Within hours of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, President George W. Bush declared “a global war on terrorism”.  Experts around the world assumed this declaration was a rallying cry, a rhetorical device to galvanize the nation to serious action.  By November 2001, however, the evidence began to mount that the President was ordering actions that could only be lawful in a de jure armed conflict: targeting to kill without warning, indefinite detention without trial, and search and seizure on the high seas without consent.  It was difficult to criticize these actions on the basis of international law, however, given that international law contained no widely accepted definition of armed conflict.  By May 2005, the International Law Association determined that there was a pressing need for a report on the meaning of armed conflict supported by international law.  The Use of Force Committee presented its Initial Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law at the Rio de Janeiro biennial meeting of the ILA.  The Report concludes that all armed conflicts have as minimum two necessary characteristics: 1.) the presence of organized groups 2.) engaged in intense armed fighting.  The Report indicates that while the United States has been engaged in an armed conflict in Afghanistan and in Iraq since 9/11, it has not been engaged in a global armed conflict.  The Initial Report will be expanded for presentation in final form in 2010 at The Hague biennial meeting."

"April 24, 2009","The paper entitled “Security: The Africa Stag -A Study of African Security Vacuum, Mercenarism and Private Security”, is a story on the security vacuum in Africa in light of mercenarism in Africa. This paper concludes that, the security vacuum would not be eliminated, but could be filed by institutionally designated bodies, either a standing force or the collaboration between this and private security companies. We say here it will not be eliminated, since the current security vacuum is a product of earlier African state inclinations in unilateralism and the overlooking of nation building through democratic guises."
"April 23, 2009","Most nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of research into the causes and consequences of civil wars, belatedly bringing the topic into the economics mainstream. This article critically reviews this interdisciplinary literature and charts productive paths forward. Formal theory has focused on a central puzzle: why do civil wars occur at all when, given the high costs of war, groups have every incentive to reach an agreement that avoids fighting? Explanations have focused on information asymmetries and the inability to sign binding contracts in the absence of the rule of law. Economic theory has made less progress, however, on the thornier (but equally important) problems of why armed groups form and cohere, and why individuals decide to fight. Likewise, the actual behavior of armed organizations and their leaders is poorly understood. On the empirical side, a vast cross-country econometric literature has aimed to identify the causes of civil war. While most work is plagued by econometric identification problems, low per capita incomes, slow economic growth and geographic conditions favoring insurgency are the factors most robustly linked to civil war. We argue that micro-level analysis and data are needed to truly decipher war’s causes, and understand the recruitment, organization, and conduct of armed groups. Recent advances in this area are highlighted. Finally, turning to the economic legacies of war, we frame the literature in terms of neoclassical economic growth theory. Emerging stylized facts include the ability of some economies to experience rapid macroeconomic recoveries, while certain human capital impacts appear more persistent. Yet econometric identification has not been adequately addressed, and there is little consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar recovery. The evidence is weakest where it is arguably most important: in understanding civil wars’ effects on institutions, technology, and social norms."
"April 22, 2009","The present paper explores some themes presented in the films Hero and The Return of the Dragon Emperor such as China’s place in the world and its future. The concept of Tianxia, meaning “all under heaven”, is introduced as an autochthonous alternative to Western theories of international relations and world order. Moreover, the revival of the concept of Tianxia is linked to other recent developments such as the reinterpretation of China’s history and of its relationship to the West. Finally, the finale’s of the two films are presented as possible outcomes of the discursive struggle over China’s place in the world while at the same time stressing the myriad range of outcomes possible."
"April 22, 2009","The Conflict Modelling Cycle is yet another phased cyclic systems approach that was originally intended for change in large group social settings rather than situations in enterprises or smaller group settings. This methodology is explained together with the ideas of Critical Systems Thinking, and together they generate a paradigm within which to examine the dramatic change towards the market economy that has occurred within Central and Eastern Europe."
"April 22, 2009","When United Nations peacekeepers violate human rights, they do immeasurable damage to their victims, their missions, and themselves. Reparation for these wrongs is essential for both rebuilding the trust that is needed for effective peacekeeping and affirming the human dignity of those who suffer the abuse. However, because of the unique status of peacekeepers as both troops in their respective national services and members of an international U.N. force, the question of which entity is liable for reparation is particularly complicated. This Article provides a comprehensive analysis of the law and practice of reparation for the human rights abuses of U.N. peacekeepers and advances a new interpretation of how the “effective control” standard of liability attribution should be applied in this context. Specifically, this Article finds that both the United Nations and troop-contributing states are subject to human rights law under certain circumstances. It also finds that both the United Nations and the troop-contributors are subject to the fundamental duty to remedy human rights violations for which they are responsible. The key question is how to determine, for a given situation, which international person is responsible for the human rights abuses of peacekeepers. Effective control is the correct governing principle. However, rather than “overall operational control” as advocated by a number of jurists and as applied in some courts, effective control must be understood to mean “control most likely to be effective in preventing the wrong in question.” Applying this revised principle to the peacekeeping context, this Article proposes a five-category framework through which to assess the appropriate locus of responsibility for peacekeepers’ human rights violations. Emphasizing the importance of considering the full complexity of the command and control relationships between states, the United Nations and peacekeepers, this framework significantly expands the liability of troop-contributing states from what remains de facto immunity under existing interpretations in the vast majority of situations. Finally, by implementing joint and several liability wherever feasible within the confines of effective control, the proposed framework seeks to maximize the avenues to remedy for victims without prejudice to the fairness and effectiveness of a framework that accurately locates those most responsible."
"April 16, 2009","Inter-state water disputes occur in federal political systems. They stand at the intersection of two branches of law: federalism under constitutional law, and water law - specifically river basin regulation. In India, constitutional federalism is the outcome of colonial history. River-basin regulation is the outcome of developments in capitalism within the social context of Europe and United States, later universalised as international law under the Helsinki Rules and the International Law Commission Convention on Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. When national law evolved in the historical context of colonisation, intersecting with international law evolved in the historical context of European capitalism, it reproduced imperial-colonial relations of super-ordination and sub-ordination in relation to water. It created an internal schism that locks the water sector into a developmental catharsis."
"April 16, 2009","The article deals with diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Colombia over the past twenty years. It starts with a review of the incident in the Gulf of Venezuela, the last major incident between the two countries, and the subsequent launching of a new round of negotiations. The negotiations are comprised of four different pillars, which have been developed during the time of the negotiation. The article shows the process of development of a new framework of negotiations, from a face-off situation to a more cooperative environment that has included five Colombian presidents and four Venezuelan presidents, including the polemic Hugo Chavez, who has supported the process of negotiation"
"April 10, 2009","The conflicts within the Great Lakes Region of Africa represent some of the classical cases of external influences within an internal conflict, thus leading to an externalization of what, once, was referred to as internal phenomena, civil wars. Some of the ways of externalizing a conflict is through economic networks and forced migrations. The present research explores the functionalities of transnational economic networks in relations to the illegal exploitation of natural resources and their impact on the ongoing conflict in the Great Lakes Region, and the presence and movement of refugees and their implications on regional peace and stability. Analyzing the role played by refugees in the actual political configuration and the security dynamics within the region."
"April 09, 2009","The framework of transitional justice, originally devised to facilitate reconciliation in countries undergoing transitions from authoritarianism to democracy, is used with increasing frequency to respond to certain types of human rights violations against indigenous peoples.  In some cases, transitional justice measures are employed in societies not undergoing regime transition. This paper outlines some of the potential complexities involved in processing indigenous demands for justice through a transitional justice framework. First, governments and indigenous peoples may differ over the scope of injustices that transitional justice measures can address. Second, governments may try to use transitional justice to draw a line through history and legitimate present policy, whereas indigenous peoples may try to use the past to critique present policy and conditions. Third, governments may try to use transitional justice to reassert their sovereign and legal authority, whereas indigenous peoples may try to resist this strategy, and even make competing claims to sovereignty and legal authority."
"April 09, 2009","By making a distinction between public and private preferences, the paper presents a dual preference model depicting possible responses (i.e., exit, sincere voice and self-subversion) to social pressures from two opposing pressure groups. Exit is deserting the setting; sincere voice is publicly expressing dissatisfaction and self-subversion is the misrepresentation of one's private preference under social pressures. Exit and sincere voice involve prohibitive costs, making self-subversion the superior option. Massive self-subversion polarizes the society, harboring multiple social equilibria with oscillating public opinion. In an effort to dominate the public discourse, each rival pressure group opts for favorable corner equilibrium. The paper applies the dual preference model to Turkey where two kinds of self-subversion appear in response to competing Islamist and secularist social projects. Islamist pressures lead to pro-Islamist self-subversion, and secularist pressures to pro-secularist self-subversion, resulting in the polarization of the Turkish public opinion along Islamists vs. Secularists. Three field experiments with 450 respondents provide empirical support for the model's conclusions. The paper ends with the discussion of the model's implications for new social equilibrium(s)."

"April 08, 2009","After 9/11, the United States and its allies took measures to protect their citizens from future terrorist attacks. While these measures aim to increase security, they have often been criticized for violating human rights. But violating rights is difficult in a constitutional democracy with separated powers and checks and balances. This paper empirically investigates the effect of the post-9/11 terror threat on human rights. We find strong evidence of a systematic increase in rights violations in the U.S. and its ally countries after 9/11. When testing the importance of checks and balances, we find that this increase is significantly smaller in countries with independent judicial review (counter-majoritarian checks), but did not depend on the presence of veto players in the legislative branch (majoritarian checks). These findings have important implications for constitutional debates on rights protection in times of emergency."
"April 08, 2009","One of the most significant shifts in current thinking on war and gender is the recognition that rape in wartime is not a simple by product of war, but often a planned and targeted policy. For many feminists 'rape as a weapon of war' provides a way to articulate the systematic, pervasive, and orchestrated nature of wartime sexual violence that marks it as integral rather than incidental to war. This recognition of rape as a weapon of war has taken on legal significance at the Rwandan and Yugoslav Tribunals where rape has been prosecuted as a crime against humanity and genocide. In this paper, I examine how the Rwanda Tribunal record of judgments conceives of rape enacted as an instrument of the genocide. I consider in particular how the Tribunal's conception of rape 'as a weapon of war' shapes what can be known about sexual violence and gender in the Rwanda genocide and what cannot, the categories of victims legally recognized and those that are not, and the questions pursued, and those foreclosed, about the patterns of violence before and during the genocide."
"April 07, 2009","This paper provides an overview of the law in force in the Macau Special Administrative Region regarding the crime of financing of terrorism; the crime of money laundering; the crime of 'illicit enrichment'; confiscation of proceeds of crime, detection and prevention mechanisms (including namely customer due diligence, record-keeping and reporting of suspicious transactions) applicable to certain professions and businesses; and the implementation of asset freezes initiated by the United Nations' Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Many of these aspects of the law were reformed in 2006."

"April 06, 2009","Many nations around the world today possess, or have the means to procure, weapons of mass destruction. They may be nuclear, chemical, biological or other types of weapons, which can be delivered through a variety of means. It is mainly the more powerful wealthy countries that have such weapons although some poorer nations are also acquiring them. The drive for countries to acquire arms is justified by national interest and security from any threat whether internal or external."
"April 06, 2009","This paper seeks to elucidate the conditions under which non-state violence might be considered legitimate under international law. Contra a tendency to dismiss all non-state violence as ""terroristic"" it makes an argument that the conditions of legitimate non-state violence, at the intersection of international law and moral theory, require us to assess the ends and means of such violence, and the conditions in which it is used. This leads one to depart from international law on the use of force as it applies to states in some cases, but also to draw on it in others. The paper concludes with a moderate stance in favor of exceptionally lending strong normative support to certain forms of non-state violence."
"April 05, 2009","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides funding to 50 states, the District of Columbia, and seven US territories through a consolidated program called the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP). There has been much controversy about the lack of structure in HSGP and the method it employs to allocate funds to the states and territories. Slice is a threat-response multi-criteria decision model that systematically evaluates the threats and responses of securing the states and territories. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and probability elicitation methods are used to capture the objective and subjective judgments used in Slice. The probability calibration and entropy methods are used along with the utility theory to obtain a composite weighted score for each state and territory. These weighted scores are combined with the population scores in a structured framework to determine the amount of funding for the states and territories."
"April 05, 2009","This paper presents N-Site, a distributed consensus building and negotiation support system, which is used to provide geographically dispersed teams with agile access to a Web-based group decision support system. Four teams located in France, Mexico, the Ukraine, and the United States participated in the N-Site project. Each team was required to research the problem using the World Wide Web (WWW). With this background, each team identified opportunities, threats and alternatives as a basis for developing a response to the Cuban Missile Crisis that confronted President Kennedy in October 1962. The strategic assessment model (SAM) (M. Tavana, J. Multi-Criteria Decision Anal. 11 (2002) 75-96; M. Tavana and S. Banerjee, Decision Sci. 26 (1995) 119-143.) was used by each team to choose a strategy that best fit the team's perspective. SAM and WWW enabled the teams to evaluate strategic alternatives and build consensus based on a series of intuitive and analytical methods including environmental scanning, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and subjective probabilities. The WWW was used to achieve interaction among the international teams as they attempted to negotiate a decision framework and select a diplomatic response. The project was assessed with a Web-distributed survey instrument. This use of the WWW has implications for international diplomacy as well as global business."
"April 03, 2009","It is well-known that people resist proposals for change for reasons that are independent of a rational calculation of self-interest.  This article explores two sources of resistance that affect public policy advocates in particular:  ""Resonance,"" (negative associations with past experience or other policy domains), and a desire t avoid the psychological and material costs of ""transition,"" (the process of adjustment, personal and institutional, that comes with any significant change)."
"April 03, 2009","The French Revolution of 1789 had a momentous impact on neighboring countries. The French Revolutionary armies during the 1790s and later under Napoleon invaded and controlled large parts of Europe. Together with invasion came various radical institutional changes. French invasion removed the legal and economic barriers that had protected the nobility, clergy, guilds, and urban oligarchies and established the principle of equality before the law. The evidence suggests that areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth, especially after 1850. There is no evidence of a negative effect of French invasion. Our interpretation is that the Revolution destroyed (the institutional underpinnings of) the power of oligarchies and elites opposed to economic change; combined with the arrival of new economic and industrial opportunities in the second half of the 19th century, this helped pave the way for future economic growth. The evidence does not provide any support for several other views, most notably, that evolved institutions are inherently superior to those 'designed'; that institutions must be 'appropriate' and cannot be 'transplanted'; and that the civil code and other French institutions have adverse economic effects."
"April 02, 2009","This short paper is intended to complement the existing literature on civil wars. First, a simple theoretical model of conflict which defines a two-sector economy. In a contested sector two agents struggle to appropriate the maximum possible fraction of a contestable output. In an uncontested sector, they hold secure property rights over the production of some goods. Agents split their resource endowment between 'butter', 'guns' and 'ice-cream'. Following the theoretical insights the empirical analysis focuses on the relationship between civil wars and different sectors of the economy. In particular, a panel probit specification shows that the incidence of a civil war decreases in the size of manufacturing sector."
"April 02, 2009","Taking and handling civilian detainees during contemporary military operations is increasingly being subjected to political, media and judicial scrutiny. This article argues that the most effective and efficient means by which to meet the demand for greater certainty, consistency, and clarity in identifying and applying appropriate and relevant norms to dealing with detainees is to formalise those norms in a 'special legal regime'. It is only through greater formalisation and systematisation that the appropriate balance will be achieved in determining the rights and obligations of both the civilian population and military forces. The paper concludes with a number of principles which could form the basis of any subsequent discussions concerning the development of a special 'detention regime' when dealing with civilian detainees."
"April 01, 2009","Robust institutional change is difficult to achieve. However, the growth paths of some countries are more likely to be affected by contemporaneous political turmoil than others. We support this claim using data on GDP growth during periods of extreme political change for 69 countries between 1870 and 2000. We argue that the robustness of a country's growth path to political uncertainty depends on the degree to which individuals are invested in its current institutions. We develop a simple model to illustrate the factors which govern an agent's decision of how much to invest in a country's institutions governing property rights and impersonal exchange. The model predicts a nonlinear relationship between investment in institutions and the effect of political uncertainty on the stability of growth. Empirical tests in which Contract Intensive Money is used to proxy for the amount of investment in the contract intensive sector in a cross-sectional and panel framework between 1960 and 2000 support the predictions of the model. Our results are also robust to controlling for the endogeneity of political change and economic growth using instrumental variables approaches."
"April 01, 2009","Whatever gains may come from fighting wars, economic growth is not among them.  We examine the long-run impact of interstate conflict on real GDP per capita for a cross section of countries between 1960 and 2000.  We construct a fatality-weighted conflict variable that accounts for both the severity and endogeneity of individual confrontations.  We include our conflict measure in a deep determinants income regression in which we control for trade, institutions and geography.  We find that a 10 percent increase in fatality-weighted conflict over the period 1960 to 2000 results in an average decrease of 1.2 to 1.6 percent in 2000 real GDP per capita."
"March 30, 2009","This brief 1994 book review essay (5500 words) examines Telford Taylor's memoir, The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials (1992).  The review is a personal one, set against two things - the author's work, while reading Taylor's memoir, in Iraq for Human Rights Watch leading a forensic team excavating Kurdish victims of the 1988 al-Anfal campaign, and the diplomatic discussions leading to the formation of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia.  The essay argues that the Nuremberg trials, according to Taylor, had a certain deflationary emotional affect - deliberately ratcheting down the emotions of what had occurred to the limited world of the courtroom.  It was able to do that because the WWII allies had been willing to pay the price of victory and had 'earned' the right to conduct a trial.  The Yugoslavia tribunal, by contrast, and at that time, was premised on a claim to universal justice that did not depend upon the willingness of its sponsors to intervene in the slaughter in the former Yugoslavia.  ""Nuremberg was a lovely hood ornament,"" said one of the author's unnamed sources, a senior European military judge advocate, ""on the ungainly vehicle that liberated Western Europe, but it was not a substitute for D-Day."""
"March 30, 2009","The paper challenges the widespread view that Bismarckian countries with a strong role of social insurance and labor market regulation are less successful than other employment regimes and hard to reforms. This has been true about a decade ago. But both the institutional set-up and the performance of BIsmarckian countries have changed fundamentally over the last years. The paper summarizes major reform dynamics in Bismarckian welfare states which had adopted a strategy of labor shedding in the 1970s and 1980s to combat open unemployment. As this was associated with an increasing burden of non-wage labor costs, this triggered a sequence of more employment-oriented and more fundamental reforms that eventually helped overcome a low employment situation. The paper pursues the trajectory of reforms, shows the structural change in labor market performance and points out the achievements of past reforms, but also emphasizes the need for further action in terms of education and training, activation and employment opportunities for all working age people in these countries so that flexibility and security can be reconciled."
"March 26, 2009","How do countries behave towards international agreements they do not intend to comply with? Do they enter agreements and cheat or do they decline participation altogether? We address these questions by analyzing how countries pursuing nuclear weapons treat the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Why do some proliferators enter the NPT and cheat while others do not? We argue that democratic proliferators are less likely to join the NPT for a variety of theoretical reasons. A Heckman probit selection model designed to analyze the behavior of proliferators between 1968 and 2006 reveals that non-democratic proliferators are substantially more likely than democratic proliferators to make deceitful nonproliferation commitments. Armed conflict and strong nonproliferation norms increase the likelihood that states will disingenuously enter the NPT. High levels of industrial capacity reduce this probability. These findings enhance scholarly understanding of nuclear proliferation and generally underscore the value of disaggregating noncompliant behavior."
"March 26, 2009","We analyze the link between economic conditions and the quality of suicide terrorism.  While the existing empirical literature shows that poverty and economic conditions are not correlated with the quantity of terror, theory predicts that poverty and poor economic conditions may affect the quality of terror.  Poor economic conditions may lead more able, better-educated individuals to participate in terror attacks, allowing terror organizations to send better-qualified terrorists to more complex, higher-impact, terror missions.  Using the universe of Palestinian suicide terrorists against Israeli targets between the years 2000 and 2006 we provide evidence on the correlation between economic conditions, the characteristics of suicide terrorists and the targets they attack.  High levels of unemployment enable terror organizations to recruit more educated, mature and experienced suicide terrorists who in turn attack more important Israeli targets."
"March 26, 2009","Is Latin America a distinctive subsystem within the international system? Do Latin American countries behave differently toward other Latin American countries than toward the rest of the world? Although some scholars argue that ""mere geographic proximity does not necessarily furnish the best basis of comparison"" (Rustow, quoted by Lijphart 1971:688), others sustain the relevance of regional differences. In this paper, I theorize what differences one should expect between the determinants of bilateral intra-Latin American cooperation and the determinants of bilateral cooperation with countries outside the region.  I found that a number of factors that are correlated with intra-Latin American cooperation show no relationship with cooperation beyond the continent: distance from the U.S., affinity with the U.S., and Spanish heritage are positively related with intra-Latin American cooperation, whereas the level of previous cooperation with the U.S. is negatively associated with current intra-Latin American cooperation. These determinants have no significant impact on bilateral cooperation with third countries."
"March 24, 2009","The article focuses on the decision of the Israeli Military Advocate General (MAG) to charge an officer who ordered the shooting of a handcuffed, blind-folded Palestinian demonstrator, and the soldier who executed the order, for 'conduct unbecoming'. It advances the following propositions: (i) from the perspective of the applicable international law, the facts of the case qualify the shooting as a war crime; (ii) said decision of the Israeli MAG is indicative of a policy of tolerance towards violence against non-violent civilian protest against the construction of the Separation Wall; (iii) the implication of such policy is twofold: first, it might transform 'conduct unbecoming' - which as a matter of law is a war crime - into a crime against humanity; second, it may well be construed as an invitation to the international community to intervene through the exercise of universal jurisdiction."
"March 23, 2009","The debates over the relationship between International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, have often focused on the question of whether human rights law continues to apply during armed conflict, and if so, on how these two bodies of law can complement each other. This article takes the continuing applicability of human rights law as an accepted and welcome starting point, and proceeds to lay out some of the challenges and obstacles encountered during the joint application of IHL and Human Rights Law, that still need to be addressed. These include extra-territorial applicability of human rights law; the mandate and expertise of human rights bodies; terminological and conceptual differences between the bodies of law; particular difficulties raised in non-international armed conflicts; and the question of economic, social and cultural rights during armed conflict."
"March 23, 2009","This paper aims to provide an overview of key aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, within the context of international law. The paper has been commissioned by the independent panel appointed by the BBC Board of Governors, to review the impartiality of the BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For that purpose, this paper focuses upon those issues over which debate has regularly emerged, in particular with regard to use of legal terms and references to international law. Discussion and the reporting of the conflict inevitably contain references to international law, and at times describes certain actions or events as being lawful or unlawful, or uses terms that have legal meaning. This paper will provide a certain amount of guidance as to when and how these legal references can be made, and when they should perhaps be avoided. As will be seen, a large number of the issues are open to multiple interpretations and more than one view can be supported. In many of these areas of contention (but not all - it is impossible to cover all issues relating to the conflict within the current scope), this paper seeks to explain the differing sides to the debate, without necessarily supporting either view. In these cases, an understanding of the points of contention, can hopefully assist in the ability to accurately report them. Furthermore, in certain areas in which the dust of debate is relatively settled, or when the vast majority of opinion supports one particular conclusion, this will be pointed out as a strong indication of an approach that can likely be safely adopted in the context of reporting. There are many other debatable aspects to the conflict beyond the legal interpretations; this paper is however concerned only with questions of international law. The format and style of this paper is not that of an academic article. Indeed, any one of the chapters presented here contains sufficient complexities to justify being the independent recipient of lengthy attention, and most of them are in fact subjects of articles and books. This paper has been written with a non-legal audience in mind, and assumes no prior knowledge of international law."
"March 23, 2009","This Handbook is primarily aimed at raising awareness of relevant medical ethical, legal and professional standards of the many health professionals who would wish to do the most conscientious job, with a view to helping victims of torture and contributing to efforts to eliminate the practice. The key task is to establish the most scientifically valid documentation concerning possible torture of individuals, consistent with the often difficult conditions under which the work sometimes has to be undertaken. It is inspired by The Istanbul Protocol, approved by United Nations bodies, which lays down the best professional standards for physicians working in the field. Yet it recognises that not all health professionals called on to do the work will have extensive experience in this field and it presents the material in a way that aims to be accessible to all these professionals. Guidance is given in the general skills of interviewing, as well as the medical examination and documentation. In addition to the relevant ethical and legal principles, the Handbook also points to sources of advice for those who wish to further their knowledge or gain support and advice on particular situations."
"March 23, 2009","Wartime challenges democracies both from without and within.  The need to marshal resources against a foreign enemy prompts the centralization of authority which, in turn, threatens to compromise domestic liberty. This article, originally delivered as the 2008 Hart Lecture, examines the ability of democracies to survive military threat with their core liberties intact.  The focus is not on the more familiar liberty versus security trade-offs, but on the ways in which divided political authority in democracies serves as a check to both military misadventure and excessive internal suppression."
"March 23, 2009","An increasing number of international investment arbitrations concern the ability of states to terminate concession contracts or impose regulations onto poorly performing foreign investors. This article attempts to address the way in which international human rights legal obligations interact with international investment agreements when states take regulatory measures to fulfil the right to water. The author examines the development of the right to water as an independent international human right in order to establish the framework of the approach, and subsequently critiques the way in which investment agreement clauses interact with the steps necessary within the human rights regime to further human rights. Expropriation, fair and equitable treatment and ""umbrella clauses"" can each play a role, individually or collectively, in creating barriers to development aimed at the realization of the right to water. Such problems have already manifested within recent investment arbitration, and the reluctance of tribunals to discuss the human rights aims of states has resulted in a significant gap in which states cannot be certain that if they follow the interpretation of state obligations under international human rights law then they will not be in breach of their other obligations under investment treaties.  Finally, the author takes an integrative approach to examine the way in which states can realize the right to water, while complying with existing investment treaties, and seeks to demonstrate that the inclusion of human rights provisions within international agreements will aid in the realization of the universal right to water."
"March 23, 2009","The review summarizes Kuperman's valuable analysis of the logistical constraints that operate generally on military humanitarian interventions. Getting a sizeable peacemaking force into tiny Rwanda when it was needed in 1994 would have taken several weeks, even with all the good will in the world. The review criticizes, however, Kuperman's parallel thesis that by 20 April 1994 it was evident to Western leaders that ""a genocide"" was being perpetrated in Rwanda. In fact, contemporary media characterizations on which those leaders relied contained significant ambiguity about the nature of the conflict through to late May 1994. The review argues that Kuperman's unjustified assumption that Rwanda experienced a centrally planned genocide in 1994 leads him astray in this respect."
"March 21, 2009","During the war in South Africa 1899-1902, British forces and imperial contingents from the self-governing colonies adopted drastic measures against civilians as a means to counter the guerrilla strategy adopted by the Boers.  Protections afforded non-combatants under the existing laws of war on land were curtailed, farms and crops were burned, livestock and seed stocks were destroyed, and women, children, and the elderly were concentrated into refugee camps under British control where thousands died from neglect, disease, and starvation.  Though technically legal under British interpretation of the laws and customs of the time, the harsh and inhumane treatment meted out to Boer civilians evolved from the ruthless military policies of British operational commanders, in particular Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, and carried out by troops like the Canadians.  Canadian soldiers were observers and participants in the nasty underside of military operations against the Boers, hardly mentioned in conventional military texts and histories.  Military victory came with a disproportionate cost in human lives among civilians, with direct parallel to current operations in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"March 21, 2009","Canadian military personnel involved in overseas deployments to foreign lands have been and will undoubtedly continue to be confronted with difficult choices between what is legally expected and their individual sense of morality...Whatever reason or national interest for going on deployments in the first place, military members live with the experiences garnered and the legacy of what they did or did not do in given situations...It is likely small consolation to today's Canadian troops engaged in peace support operations and low-intensity conflict to know that the phenomenon is far from new.  Indeed Canadian troops deployed in similar operations in the past reacted in much the same fashion, especially when called upon to implement unpopular and questionable policies affecting civilians on official orders from higher superiors.  A notable example is the farm burning conducted during the South African War, Canada's first major overseas deployment."
"March 21, 2009","Government efforts to force continuous production onto British Columbia shipyards during the Second World War challenged relations between state, private industry and organized labor. While workers wanted comparable hours, pay and wages to those obtaining in the United States, Canada's federal Minister of Labor imposed arbitrary orders-in-council to enforce continuous production that created discord and eventually the appointment of a federal royal commission.  Continuous production did not achieve the promised results for the maximum production of ships."
"March 21, 2009","In modern warfare at and from the sea, logistics are crucially important to the implementation of strategy and conduct of operational campaigns.  Between August 1943 and March 1944, a British joint service mission led by Major-General John Lethbridge travelled to North America, the Pacific, and India to study the organisation, equipment, and methods necessary for coming offensive operations against Japan.  The British obtained valuable information from the Americans and connected with those countries of the British Empire most directly involved.  The Lethbridge Mission's progress and findings informed evolving Admiralty planning for supporting naval forces to be sent to the Indian and Pacific Oceans in pursuance of British wartime strategy."
"March 20, 2009","During the Second World War, the inland, industrial urban centres of Central Canada including the city of Hamilton became involved in the production of war materials for the fighting navies and merchant marines.  Private companies in Hamilton secured contracts related to naval work requiring additional facilities and hiring of workers.  Industrial plants were used to fit out warships, build and install machinery and electrical components, manufacture naval armaments such as guns and barrels and fabricate barges along with other items of naval importance.  Industrial Hamilton in its own may made a significant contribution to the war at sea."
"March 20, 2009","This book argues that much of the literature on political leadership has made little meaningful connection with the issues of peace, conflict and divided societies. In providing a critical interpretation of political leadership during the Northern Ireland peace process, it shows how the 'leadership lens' offers insights not offered by conventional analyses of peacemaking processes.  Using interviews with political elites in Northern Ireland, the book discusses the confusions, contradictions and chameleonic nature of leadership and its role, capacity and effect."
"March 20, 2009","On 12 July 2006 Hezbollah forces opened fire on Israel with a barrage of missiles targeted at Israeli northern settlements. Concurrently, the organization infiltrated the northern border, kidnapped two I.D.F. soldiers from Israeli territory to Lebanon, killed eight soldiers and wounded several more. Israeli government immediately convened an emergency meeting in which it decided on an Israeli military response. The fighting that ensued in the wake of these events lasted thirty-four days during which hundreds of missiles were fired upon Northern Israel. It terminated on the morning of 14 August 2006, when the ceasefire decided upon by the Security Council of the U.N. came into force. The war took a death toll of one hundred and fifty Israeli soldiers and citizens. The war evoked a sharp sense of failure among the Israeli public and the feeling that overall, the war had been grossly mismanaged. As if to highlight the war's mismanagement, it took the Government an additional half a year to even officially declare that the military operation in Lebanon had actually been a 'war'. And so, immediately after the ceasefre, a public campaign began, calling upon the Government to establish a state commission of enquiry to investigate the failures of the war, and demanding the resignations of the national leadership: the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, and the Chief of Staff. After much hesitation, the Government decided against the establishment of a state commission of enquiry, deciding instead to set up a 'governmental commission of inquiry' to examine the conduct of the political and military levels at all stages of the war. The commission was headed by a retired district court judge, E. Winograd (hereinafter referred to as the 'Winograd Commission'). This article examines the various aspects of the Winograd Commission. Firstly we will present the tools provided by Israeli law for the investigation of wars and the history of commissions of enquiry. In this context we will explain existing distinctions between a state commission of enquiry and the Winograd commission, which was set up as a 'governmental commission of inquiry'. Then we will analyze the ongoing accompaniment-supervision of the Israeli Supreme Court, from the time of the commission's establishment until the submission of its final report."
"March 19, 2009","This article, drawing on an extensive collection of peace agreements dating from 1990 until the present day, analyzes peace agreement provisions for civil society involvement and considers the extent to which peace agreements proffer new models of participatory democracy. We begin with some background and a short overview of political theory on participatory democracy, identifying key dilemmas. The body of the article sets out a comprehensive analysis of peace agreement provisions for civil society, indicating how peace agreements negotiate the dilemmas identified in theory. We then evaluate this negotiation in the context of post-agreement implementation difficulties. In conclusion, we discuss the implications for future research."
"March 18, 2009","The paper is an attempt to reestablish the importance of a free press in the context of combating the most dreadful threat faced by countries in current times - terrorism. Considering the case of transnational terrorism, the robust analysis establishes that a free press does have a mitigating impact on terrorism. The importance of the paper extends further to substantiate that, though a democracy has often been criticized to be terror-inviting, when empowered by a free press, the two together have a strong terror dampening eect."
"March 18, 2009","This short essay uses a recent case study - the controversy surrounding the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's access to European airline reservation data - as a vehicle for exploring the European Union's new enthusiasm for projecting its data-privacy values globally.  We begin by discussing how DHS uses passenger name records, or ""PNR,"" to detect potential terrorist operatives.  We then examine the legal authorities under which passenger data is collected and used, including domestic constitutional and statutory norms as well as principles of international law.  Next, the essay discusses the hostile response of some EU policymakers to DHS's use of reservation data, and offers possible explanations for their efforts to apply European data-privacy principles to American national-security initiatives.  Finally, we propose solutions to transatlantic conflicts that will help preserve both individual privacy and national autonomy."
"March 18, 2009","On January 16, 2009, Kenya and the United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which Kenya agreed to try suspected pirates captured by the U.S.  In addition, Kenya signed a similar MOU with the European Union on March 6, 2009. Another is planned between Kenya and China."
"March 17, 2009","We show that the recent rise in Afghan opium production is caused by violent conflicts. Violence destroys roads and irrigation, crucial to alternative crops, and weakens local incentives to rebuild infrastructure and enforce law and order. Exploiting a unique data set, we show that Western hostile casualties, our proxy for conflict, have strong impact on subsequent local opium production. This proxy is shown to be exogenous to opium. We exploit the discontinuity at the end of the planting season: Conflicts have strong effects before and no effect after planting, assuring causality. Effects are strongest where government law enforcement is weak."
"March 16, 2009","Military roles need to respond to the change demanded of them with the decline of the superpower standoff. There are perspectives from which conflicts can be evaluated in terms of the optimisation of incursion outcomes, and from which judgements can be made about whether they can be won or lost. However, a new view is emerging that conflicts are not so simple as to make the notions of optimisation, or decisive lose outcomes, useful. To respond to this view, senior military strategists should adopt new ways of thinking that encompasses the idea of complexity. Viable systems theory, concerned with the survivability of organisations, provides a graphic way of exploring this."
"March 15, 2009","Inequality between identity groups has long been thought of as an important contributor to social unrest and violence as well as being important in assessing the justice of societies. Yet, the measurement of the ways in which such groups differ and are unequal remains underdeveloped. Accordingly, this paper introduces three distinct but interlinked concepts relating to inequality between groups which can be used in empirical estimation of group based inequality. We define and discuss the concepts of Representational Inequality, Sequence Inequality and Group Inequality Comparison. Representational Inequality captures the extent to which a given level of attribute is shared between members of distinct groups, Sequence Inequality captures the extent to which groups are ordered hierarchically in their possession of the attribute and Group Inequality Comparison captures the extent to which differences between groups account for the overall inequality of individuals. These concepts can be used to measure the degree of segregation, clustering and polarization between groups. In order to illustrate the merit of these concepts and their joint application to understanding group based inequality we provide an example using DHS data for five societies. It may be seen that the choice of measures is greatly consequential in applied work."
"March 15, 2009","The war in Iraq initiated in March 2003 triggered a wave of violence and turmoil in the country, exposing households to insecurity and to instability in daily life.  The level of violence has varied across provinces, the south and centre areas being the most affected. Using the different intensities of the conflict across areas and the age at exposure to the war among cohorts, I analyze a possible causal effect of the war on nutritional outcomes of children. I use two empirical strategies, leading to very similar results. Estimates indicate that children born in areas affected by high levels of violence are 0.8 cm shorter than children born in low violence provinces. These results are robust to several specifications. Furthermore, the paper also addresses the channels through which the conflict has affected health and nutrition. The results have not only short-term policy implications, but also, given the empirical evidence of the impact of early child malnutrition on later education, labour and productivity outcomes, the results are of great importance for the future."
"March 12, 2009","Internal conflicts entail large asset losses for certain segments in the civilian population. Asset losses may compromise the future welfare of households, thus leaving a legacy of structural poverty that is difficult to overcome. The purpose of this article is to analyze how asset losses occur during internal conflicts and the process of asset accumulation following the initial shock. To do this, we concentrate on a particularly vulnerable group of victims of war-the displaced population in Colombia. In achieving our objective, we adopt quantitative and qualitative approaches by: (i) providing a detailed description of losses stemming from forced displacement; (ii) analyzing qualitative evidence so as to understand the asset recovery processes for the displaced population; and (iii) estimating OLS, Instrumental Variable and quartile regressions in order to identify the determinants of asset losses stemming from forced displacement, and asset accumulation following the initial shock. The results indicate that recuperating asset losses or accumulating new assets is a rare event; only 25 percent of households are able to recover their original asset base, while asset ownership still seems insufficient for overcoming poverty. In addition, displaced households do not catch up even as settlement at destination sites consolidates. Therefore, unless a positive intervention is implemented, displaced households become locked in a low income trajectory, and are unlikely to leap forward to a high return asset level."
"March 12, 2009","This paper considers the effectiveness of Angolan government, UN and non-governmental attempts to protect human rights in Angola from early 1998 to date, during and in the immediate aftermath of the recent conflict. Angola has suffered from one of the longest running conflicts in Africa. Originally a battleground for a proxy war between the Cold War superpowers, the conflict developed its own self sustaining dynamic in the 1990s fuelled by revenue from oil and diamonds. The impact of the war on the Angolan people was severe - at its height in early 2002, over 4 million were internally displaced and around 450,000 lived in refugee in neighboring countries.  Increasing violence caused by rebel attacks and government counter insurgency activities fuelled forced displacement and created one of the largest humanitarian crises of the 1990s. The international community responded with UN Security Council mandated sanctions against UNITA, extensive humanitarian activities and attempts at both promotion and protection of human rights. However, the effectiveness of human rights activities was impeded by weak political support from donor nations, the nature of the governing regime, and humanitarian imperatives. Despite some minor successes, with respect to human rights, Angola is a case study of failure; the failure of the international community and the Angolan government to adequately protect it's citizens from gross and systematic human rights abuses during a brutal civil war."
"March 12, 2009","This paper examines the tension between raison d'etat and morality that exists in US government humanitarian initiatives. It asks whether US humanitarian assistance overseas is truly based on needs alone through a detailed examination of one US government unit dedicated to providing lifesaving emergency relief in situations of natural or man-made disaster - the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). The paper concludes that the majority of OFDA interventions are indeed driven by basic humanitarian need, though humanitarian interventions in conflict situations may serve as a replacement for a broader political engagement that addresses the conflict giving rise to the need for the humanitarian operation. However, in a small but significant number of instances, humanitarian aid, including assistance disbursed through OFDA, is strongly associated with US military intervention, with additional fiscal resources being mobilized through OFDA to respond to humanitarian needs during US military operations. In these situations (Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq) US humanitarian aid has been mobilized to respond to the humanitarian consequences of conflicts where the U.S. itself is a belligerent. This trend has been accelerated in US military interventions post 9/11. Finally, difficulties in the operationalization of the 'needs alone' concept mean that measuring the extent to which US humanitarian assistance, even in countries where the US military is not deployed, is genuinely targeted based on comparative needs remains a difficult challenge, and is an area requiring further research."
"March 12, 2009","Angola is a country that has been racked by conflict for the last 40 years. The impact of the conflict on the people of Angola has been devastating. Angola's post-independence conflict has been marked by prolonged involvement of the international community, both during the Cold War and in the post-Cold War era. This paper analyses Ireland's political and humanitarian involvement with Angola in 2001-2. During this period Ireland was chair of the Angola Sanctions Committee (Against UNITA), a role it was assigned as a member of the UN Security Council. This paper examines Ireland's role as chair, as well as Ireland's broader political approach to Angola. The paper concludes that while Ireland did a 'solid job' in chairing the committee, the country failed to develop a more holistic and coherent foreign-policy stance towards the humanitarian crisis in Angola. Thus, Ireland missed an important opportunity to highlight (and possibly mitigate) some of the root causes of the humanitarian crisis, including forced displacement by Angolan government forces."
"March 12, 2009","This paper demonstrates that the public/private distinction that undergirds the view that States have a monopoly of violence of the means to wage war while inaccurate continues to inform contemporary debates in international law in the context of conflicts over resources like diamonds. It shows how the sharp distinctions and boundaries  between public and private realms in relation to the monopolization of violence contributes to the ambivalent commitments of the global legal order -and of international law in particular - in dealing with non-state actors engaged in initiating or starting wars in the context of resource wars. In short, my claim is that international law is split at the root - it is split at a number of levels: first, it is split in proceeding from the premise that the use of force (violence) can only be evaluated for its lawfulness if it fulfills certain criteria that relate to the conduct of a State, but where it involves the conduct of non-State actors such violence/use or use of force largely - though not exclusively - falls outside the scope the rules of jus ad bellum."
"March 11, 2009","To explore the implications of riders - provisions added to appropriation bills that ""ride"" on the underlying bill - on the United States' continued military force in Iraq, the author draws three hypotheticals, each focusing on the debate surrounding the policy and political disputes raised by the use of such riders.  A ""withdrawal"" rider, which would authorize funding only if there exists a plan to withdraw American ground troops by a set deadline, remains the most important - and controversial - rider.  Riders may also significantly affect wartime policies, like those that limit the President's use of reservists in combat so as to make them available for use in domestic affairs. Finally, Congress may attach riders to legislation that conditions military and reconstruction aid on governance concessions by the Iraqi government to the Sunni minority."
"March 11, 2009","The war in the South Caucasus sent shockwaves throughout the post-Soviet world, European capitals and across the Atlantic, making more urgent the demand for a re-evaluation of policies towards Russia. The projection of hard power in Georgia generated a number of unintended consequences for the Russian state. The crisis and war unveiled many of Russia's weaknesses and vulnerabilities across four crucial dimensions: the military, the 'power vertical' and federalism, the economy and Russia's international position. This paper aims at reassessing Russia's military, political, economic and diplomatic might after the battle in the South Caucasus. The research concludes with proposals for a new Western strategy on Russia and the EU's Eastern Neighbourhood which would ensure an undivided and sustainable European order."
"March 11, 2009","When judged by the sheer amount of scholarly literature to which it has given rise, uniform law, taken broadly here to include all forms of inter-jurisdictional legal harmonization, is a vast subject.  To a significant extent, however, this fascinating subject presents but an academic interest.  That is because efforts toward legal harmonization and the incorporation of uniform law have remained vain in many areas.  Not so in respect of arbitration, the practice of which has seen spectacular growth in the context of international trade and commerce over the past twenty-five years.  This paper looks at the incorporation of uniform arbitration law both in its formal and informal manifestations.  An overview of incorporation through procedural and substantive instruments is first provided with reference to Canadian arbitration laws.  Drawing insights from a multidisciplinary look at the concept of praxis and the teachings of Lon Fuller, the paper then looks at the status of arbitration practice vis-a-vis arbitration law and its incorporation, emphasizing the respective roles of experts and courts."
"March 11, 2009","This article argues that peaceful nuclear cooperation - the transfer of nuclear technology, materials, or know-how from one state to another for peaceful purposes - helps explain why some countries pursue and acquire nuclear weapons while others do not. In particular, countries receiving peaceful nuclear assistance are more likely to initiate nuclear weapon programs and successfully develop the bomb - especially when they are also faced with security threats.  To test this argument, this article uses a new dataset of more than 2,000 bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation agreements (NCAs) signed between 1950 and 2000.  A series of quantitative and qualitative tests provide strong empirical support.  This article challenges the conventional wisdom by showing that supplier countries raise the risks of further nuclear proliferation when they assist others in developing civil nuclear programs.  Further, the relationship between civilian nuclear cooperation and proliferation is surprisingly broad.  Even ostensibly ""innocuous"" assistance such as training nuclear scientists or providing research or power reactors increases the likelihood that states will pursue nuclear weapons and ultimately acquire them.  With a renaissance in nuclear power on the horizon, major suppliers like the United States should reconsider their willingness to assist other countries in developing peaceful nuclear programs."
"March 11, 2009","On January 16-17, 2009, the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism (INSCT), a joint program of Syracuse University's College of Law and Maxwell School, hosted an interdisciplinary workshop gathering scholars and practitioners with interest in the topic of resilience in conflict and disaster settings. INSCT Director William Banks, INSCT Fellow Nick Armstrong, Professor Pat Longstaff (Newhouse), and Professor Ines Mergel (Maxwell), spearheaded this effort as a vital first step in a larger effort to understand the underlying factors that impact a society's ability to recover from a major conflict or disaster. Attendees included experts and academics from the U.S. Department of State's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), USAID's Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM), U.S. Army War College, West Point, Syracuse Center of Excellence, L.C. Smith College of Engineering, and several academic disciplines such as ecology, anthropology, public administration, and economics. The purpose of this workshop was to identify the commonalities in various resilient systems in order to generate theoretical development for future resilience research."
"March 06, 2009","Since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, military strategists, historians, soldiers, and policymakers have made counterinsurgency's principles and paradoxes second nature, and they now expect that counterinsurgency operations will be the likely wars of the future. Yet despite counterinsurgency's ubiquity in military and policy circles, legal scholars have almost completely ignored it. This Article evaluates the laws of war in light of modern counterinsurgency strategy. It shows that the laws of war are premised on a kill-capture strategic foundation that does not apply in counterinsurgency, which follows a win-the-population strategy. The result is that the laws of war are disconnected from military realities in multiple areas - from the use of non-lethal weapons to occupation law. It also argues that the war on terror legal debate has been myopic and misplaced. The shift from a kill-capture to win-the-population strategy not only expands the set of topics legal scholars interested in contemporary conflict must address but also requires incorporating the strategic foundations of counterinsurgency when considering familiar topics in the war on terror legal debates."
"March 05, 2009","The concept of democracy has long fuelled controversy among international legal scholars, especially concerning its definition. This article is an attempt to single out three constitutive  elements of democracy that have been subject to extensive scrutiny in the practice of electoral assistance and the more comprehensive peace-building and state-building missions that the UN has taken up or supported since the end of the twentieth century: free and fair elections, freedom of association - with emphasis on the freedom to establish political parties - and freedom of expression. In doing so, this paper examines the role and the importance of each of these three constitutive elements in the practice pertaining to post-conflict reconstruction of Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan, and Iraq."
"March 05, 2009","The progressive expansion of powers given to international actors is the result of the disappearance of the 'non-intervention' policy towards the existence of conflicts. Along the lines of this strategic shift, issues traditionally falling under the 'domestic jurisdiction' of states are increasingly 'internationalised'. First, the scope of measures the Security Council can take has expanded into areas formerly considered as exclusively internal, in particular in view of the tendency to supervise the 'democratization' of state institutions. Secondly, situations which might have been considered purely internal are now being considered as threats to the international peace and security, therefore potentially triggering Security Council action."
"March 03, 2009","If humanitarian tragedies caused by war have for a long time been the object of legal regulation, it was not until recently that the protection of the natural environment in armed conflict has attracted similar attention. The consequence is that there is yet no homogenous body of law that protects the ecosystem from hostilities. Apart from a few rules specifically addressing environmental warfare, indirect protection derives from provisions that were conceived for other purposes and from the underlying principles of customary international law that traditionally regulate the conduct of military hostilities. This raises the problem of the adequacy of the existing rules to protect the natural environment from warfare. In order to answer this question, the present chapter will first examine the rules available in the laws of war and will distinguish those specifically addressing the natural environment from other rules that might however apply and provide some protection. Individual criminal responsibility for the violation of such rules will then be discussed. In the second part, the chapter will investigate whether the law of peace, in particular international environmental law, can play any role in the protection of the environment in time of armed conflict and will verify its applicability pendente bello."
"March 03, 2009","This contribution investigates the link between welfare policies and domestic terrorism for 15 Western European countries during 1984-2003. We argue that welfare policies improve national social and socio-economic conditions and thus increase the opportunity costs of terrorism. We investigate whether spending in certain policy fields translates into a reduction of terrorism, and whether certain worlds of welfare capitalism [Esping-Andersen (1990)] are more resistant to the threat of domestic terrorism. We find strong support that higher spending in certain policy fields is associated with a significant reduction in domestic terrorist activity. Only moderate evidence indicates that the different worlds of welfare capitalism are differently prepared to deal with domestic terrorism. Spending - or the mere existence of a social system - seems to be more strongly associated with a reduction in domestic terrorism than the actual welfare systems' institutional design. Our findings are robust to a variety of specifications."
"March 02, 2009","In this article the authors review a number of recent legislative efforts to define 'terrorism' in common law jurisdictions and, on the basis of that review, make several recommendations as to the way in which that concept should be defined. These are, broadly: that a general and not a specific approach be adopted; that specific exceptions be made in favour of advocacy and civil protest; and, finally, that legislation should remain the primary means of defining terrorism."
"February 26, 2009","This article will first explore the history of border searches. It will look to the reorganization of the border enforcement apparatus resulting from 9/11 as well as the intersection of the Fourth Amendment and border searches generally. Then, it will analyze the Supreme Court's last statement on border searches in the Flores-Montano27 decision, including what impact this decision has had on the lower courts. Finally, the article will focus on Fourth Amendment cases involving terrorism concerns after 9/11, as a means of drawing some conclusions about the effect the emerging emphasis on terrorism and national security concerns will likely have on border searches in this post-9/11 world."
"February 26, 2009","Targeted killing is extra-judicial, premeditated killing by a state of a specifically identified person not in its custody. States have used this tool, secretly or not, throughout history. In recent years, targeted killing has generated new controversy as two states in particular - Israel and the United States - have struggled against opponents embedded in civilian populations. As a matter of express policy, Israel engages in targeted killing of persons it deems members of terrorist organizations who are involved in attacks on Israel. The United States, less expressly, has adopted a similar policy against al Qaeda - particularly in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the CIA has used unmanned Predator drones to fire Hellfire missiles to attempt to kill al Qaeda leaders. This campaign of Predator strikes has continued into the Obama Administration."
"February 26, 2009","This essay will ask if there is a causal link between the nature of a peace agreement and the incidence of corruption. It examines the case of post-war Lebanon and looks at the decade following the settlement of Lebanon's bitter civil war (1975-1989). The essay treats corruption as the dependent variable and shows how the rise of blurred, uncodified institutions and the weakening of the state's control agencies can be traced back to the nature of the peace agreement. It argues that the particular logic of ""consensus"" that marked the Ta'if Accord resulted in an increase of corruption."
"February 25, 2009","We use the Hsiao-Granger method to test for growth-terrorism causality for seven Western European countries. In bivariate settings, the impact of economic performance on domestic terrorism is very strong. In trivariate settings, the impact of performance on terrorism diminishes. Here, we find that economic performance leads terrorist violence in robust ways only for three out of seven countries. Terrorism is almost never found to causally influence growth in bivariate and trivariate specifications. Our findings indicate that (i) the role of economic performance in determining terrorist violence appears to have been important for some countries and (ii) all attacked economies have been successful in adjusting to the threat of terrorism."
"February 25, 2009","The political relations between India and Pakistan remain consistently adversarial in the Indian Ocean region. Yet the Indus Treaty signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan has endured despite the unabashedly hostile nature of the political relationship between the two states. There are other paradoxes concerning the role of the World Bank and scientific and developmental principles on water resources development. This article examines the paradoxes in the workings of the Indus Treaty."
"February 24, 2009","This paper explores the ways in which the single gravest threat, terrorism, can be tackled. It discusses the evolution of terrorism citing that terrorism is not new. It goes on to the changes and trends which have taken place in methods used by terrorists. It deals with the strange relationship the terrorists and the counter-terrorists share with each other with both sides trying to develop new tactics and trying to be a step ahead of each other."
"February 23, 2009","The checkpoint in the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT) provides a unique space for examining how technologies of gazing are utilized by military and civil actors alike. It also exposes the power of these gazes both as acts of security and as subversive acts of citizenship. Originally, the checkpoints in the OPT were constituted as binary places where military officials observed the occupied Palestinian population. Through introducing a counter-gaze, the women of the organization Machsom Watch (MW) have attempted to disrupt this binary constellation of 'powerful versus powerless'. Herein, I consider this counter-gaze as an act of citizenship, especially in that it transforms the political, social, and ethical consciousness of its actors, and perhaps also that of the other actors who operate in the space of the checkpoint. While the gaze of security and calculability looks to empty its object of agency, what happens when MW women gaze back at security, exposing an otherwise clandestine aspect of its existence as such? For example, when MW mothers and sisters counteract the panoptic gaze of the soldiers by seeing them as sons and brothers, does this counter-gaze rupture the habitus of security enacted in this place, or is it further absorbed into the contagion of power that these women seek to disrupt? One way or the other, the women of MW constitute a third party in the checkpoint scene, rather than the usual two parties - soldiers and Palestinians - that confront each other in this space. But what happens when other actors intervene, this time with a different gaze and agenda? How does the dynamic between these various actors create and subvert the meaning of the gaze as an act of citizenship? The following paragraphs briefly explore these questions. Ultimately, I suggest that the interactions between the various gazes produced in and by the checkpoints are not only important indicators but are also constitutive of the changing relationships between the actors that operate in this place, producing an increasingly complex set of hybrid gazes that constantly shift the power dynamics enacted in the checkpoint."
"February 23, 2009","This paper provides a theoretical analysis regarding the rationality of suicide attacks from an economist's point of view. It is argued that although a terrorist gives up future utility from consumption by committing a suicide attack, this loss can be overcompensated by the utility he derives from the attack. Some individual cases of suicide bombers are presented in order to elucidate the diversity of motivations behind the attacks. We derive conditions under which a rational agent might decide to become a suicide bomber - or to announce the attack and defect later. The paper shows why the decision to commit a suicide attack can be time-inconsistent and what mechanisms might prevent time-inconsistency. Integrating the psychological concepts of cognitive dissonance and terror management theory into our economic analysis, we demonstrate why - although predicted by standard economic theory - defection is a phenomenon rarely observed. We finally present some policy implications. In the light of our analysis, policies that focus on material well-being seem less promising than policies that address non-monetary benefits of suicide attacks. The paper concentrates on two policy strategies: offering alternatives - with respect to the aims of terrorism as well as the means to attain them - and reducing the information bias - with respect to the availability as well as the access to information."
"February 23, 2009","According to Huntington, international terrorism is spatially dependent because of what he refers to as civilizational rallying effects, forming one aspect of his infamous clash of civilizations paradigm. If radical groups from one country attack targets from a country of another civilization, then groups from other countries of the same civilization as the initial terrorist groups will become more likely to also attack this target. In other words, international terrorism should spread along civilizational lines. Testing such a hypothesis suffers from a major difficulty known as Galton’s problem: spatial dependence is difficult to distinguish from spatial clustering and common shocks and trends. We employ techniques for the spatial analysis of dyadic data to disentangle spatial dependence from spatial clustering and common shocks and trends. We find no general, global support for the rallying hypothesis. Neither do we find evidence for an increase in terror contagion along civilizational lines after the end of the Cold War. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis of spatial dependence in the post-Cold War period for the specific civilizational combinations formed between Islamic and non-Islamic countries and between Islamic countries and the West. Our study thus clearly rejects Huntington’s prediction of a general civilizational rallying effect of terrorism, but it lends some, albeit weak, support to the hypothesis as applied to specific inter-civilizational combinations."
"February 22, 2009","This paper examines the effect of oil abundance on political violence. First, we revisit one of the main empirical findings of the civil conflict literature that oil abundance causes civil war. Using a unique panel dataset describing worldwide oil discoveries and extractions, we show that simply controlling for country fixed effects removes the statistical association between oil reserves and civil war in a sample of more than 100 countries over the period 1930-2003. Other macro-political violence measures, such as coup attempts and irregular leader transitions, are not affected by oil reserves either. Rather, we find that oil-rich nondemocratic countries have a larger defense burden. To further address the problems of endogeneity and measurement error, we exploit randomness in the success or failure of oil explorations. We find that oil discoveries do not increase the likelihood of violent challenges to the state in the sample of country-years in which at least one exploratory well is drilled, and oil discoveries increase military spending in the subsample of nondemocratic countries. Similar results are obtained on a larger sample which includes country-years without oil exploration while controlling for selection based on the likelihood of exploration using propensity score matching. We suggest a possible explanation for our findings based on the idea that oil-rich nondemocratic regimes effectively expend resources to deter potential challengers."
"February 22, 2009","This article discusses how the 1999 Senate process of impeaching President Clinton marked a change in the procedures governing impeachment procedures.  In previous judicial trials, the Senate played a passive role, leaving the organizing and running of the case to others.  Reacting to the high stakes and political pressures of President Clinton's impeachment trials, the Senate created a new procedural model, what the author coins the ""specially investigated President."""
"February 21, 2009","Throughout the Suharto era, political scientists found Latin American corporatist models of the all-pervasive state among their most useful tools. But the Maluku conflict forces us to reexamine these long-held convictions. Today nobody talks corporatism, and observers are looking for other heuristic aids. Perhaps we should be looking at Africa's failed states. According to a comprehensive study of communal conflict around the world conducted by Ted Gurr and his colleagues, forty-two percent of sub-Saharan Africans belong to a politicised communal group. Their leaders manipulate ethnicity not in order to break away from the state but to grab a bigger share of state power for themselves. Gurr labels this kind of conflict the ""communal contenders""."
"February 21, 2009","Political relations between Russia and both the EU and the US have recently reflected an extended legacy of distrust and resentment. But renewal of leadership is now on the horizon in all three cases: in Russia already in May, in the US by the end of the year, and for the EU the Lisbon Treaty will bring at the turn of the year a new Presidency of the European Council and a reinforced role for the High Representative for foreign affairs. In this Policy Brief, Michael Emerson sketches the substantive moves that would allow the new leaders to transform the present sad state of affairs between Russia and the West. He argues that the case for doing so is strong. The West has a huge interest in integrating Russia into its economic, political and security structures, if that can be done in mutually acceptable ways. And Europe and the West need to get their affairs in order together, to be better placed to face the new foreign policy challenges presented by the rise of Asia and the emerging multi-polar world."
"February 20, 2009","It has become a standard conceit in counterterrorism policy to describe al Qaeda and similar such transnational organizations as networks. At the same time, among a scholars focused on topics such as cross-border regulatory regimes, transnational litigation, and the structures of public international law, there has been an increasing consideration of law and legal institutions as being a part of one or more networks.  This essay, prepared for the Oklahoma City University School of Law symposium, ""Military Commissions and Congress's Role in the War on Terror,"" is thus the tale of two networks: what happens when the network of terror and the network of law collide."
"February 20, 2009","Situations of chronic conflict across the globe make it imperative to draw attention to its gendered health consequences, particularly the violation of women's reproductive and sexual rights. Since early 2002 in Gujarat, western India, the worst kind of state-sponsored violence against Muslims has been perpetrated, which continues to this day. This paper describes the history of that violence and highlights the mental and physicial consequences of sexual and gender-based violence and the issues that need to be addressed by the police, the health care system and civil society. It draws upon several reports, including from the International Initiative for Justice and the Medico Friend Circle, which documented the reproductive, sexual and mental health consequences of the violence in Gujarat, and the lacunae in the responses of the health system. The paper calls for non-discrimination to be demonstrated by health personnel in the context of conflict and social unrest. Their training should include conflict as a public health problem, their roles and responsibilities in prevention, treatment and documentation of this ""disease"", and focus on relevant medico-legal methodology and principles, the psychological impact of sexual assault on victims, and the legal significance of medical evidence in these cases."
"February 20, 2009","In April and May 2006, internal conflict in Timor-Leste led to the displacement of approximately 150,000 people, around 15% of the population. The violence was most intense in Dili, the capital, where many residents were displaced into camps in the city or to the districts. Research utilising in-depth qualitative interviews, service statistics and document review was conducted from September 2006 to February 2007 to assess the health sector's response to reproductive health needs during the crisis. The study revealed an emphasis on antenatal care and a maternity waiting camp for pregnant women, but the relative neglect of other areas of reproductive health. There remains a need for improved coordination, increased dialogue and advocacy around sensitive reproductive health issues as well as greater participation of the health sector in response to gender-based violence. Strengthening neglected areas and including all components of sexual and reproductive health in coordination structures will provide a stronger foundation through which to respond to any future crises in Timor-Leste."
"February 20, 2009","A study in 2000-2001 of causes of death of women of reproductive age (15-49) in the West Bank, Palestinian Occupied Territories, found that 154 of the 411 deceased women aged 15-49 with known marital status were single. Death notification forms for reported deaths were analysed and verbal autopsies carried out, where possible, with relatives of the deceased women. We found important differences in the age at death and causes of death among the single and married women, which can be attributed to the disadvantaged social status of single women in Palestinian society, exacerbated by the current unstable political situation. 41% of the deceased single women were under 25 years of age at death compared to 8% of the married women. The proportion of violent deaths and suicides among the single women was almost twice as high as among the married women, mainly in those below age 25. The single women were also more likely to die from medical conditions which indicated that they faced barriers to accessing health care. The fieldwork was conducted at the height of the Intifada and the Israeli military response, with heavy restrictions on mobility, limiting the possibility of probing deeper into the circumstances surrounding sensitive deaths. More research into the socio-cultural context of single women in Palestine society is needed as a basis for intervention."
"February 20, 2009","To improve access to maternal health care and family planning services in conflict-stricken Maguindanao province, southern Philippines, several non-governmental organisations have begun collaborating with local public health services. This exploratory study describes the experiences of local government service providers and two NGOs in a context of long-standing internal armed conflict, how and to what extent provision has been affected by the conflict and what has been done to overcome its effects. It is based on interviews with six health service coordinators and providers. Local government-NGO partnership takes the form of giving NGOs space in government health care facilities and receiving from them critical supplies, personnel and contraceptives. Service delivery structures have generally been spared from direct attacks by the parties involved locally in armed conflict due to the perceived benefits of their services, including for rebels and their families, their neutral stance and willingness to treat everyone. However, they do suffer from occasional disruption and kidnappings and need to seek protection from local leaders. When mass evacuation is required providers follow displaced families to evacuation points to ensure they continue to get services. Collaboration for maternal health care provision is recent, but the planned expansion of NGO projects will help it to evolve."
"February 20, 2009","The Eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is currently undergoing a brutal war. Armed groups from the DRC and neighbouring countries are committing atrocities and systematically using sexual violence as a weapon of war to humiliate, intimidate and dominate women, girls, their men and communities. Armed combatants take advantage with impunity, knowing they will not be held to account or pursued by police or judicial authorities. A particularly inhumane public health problem has emerged: traumatic gynaecological fistula and genital injury from brutal sexual violence and gang-rape, along with enormous psychosocial and emotional burdens. Many of the women who survive find themselves pregnant or infected with STIs/HIV with no access to treatment. This report was compiled at the Doctors on Call for Service/Heal Africa Hospital in Goma, Eastern Congo, from the cases of 4,715 women and girls who suffered sexual violence between April 2003 and June 2006, of whom 702 had genital fistula. It presents the personal experiences of seven survivors whose injuries were severe and long-term, with life-changing effects. The paper recommends a coordinated effort amongst key stakeholders to secure peace and stability, an increase in humanitarian assistance and the rebuilding of the infrastructure, human and physical resources, and medical, educational and judicial systems."
"February 20, 2009","This paper surveys the international legal frameworks, including the many guidelines, handbooks, resolutions, toolkits, conclusions and manuals produced by various United Nations bodies, that confirm an awareness of the protection issues specific to women and girls displaced by conflict. It explores the extent to which these documents address the gendered impacts of conflict-induced migration, and the role of United Nations bodies as international governmental organisations in implementing these norms. The main focus is upon internally displaced women and women refugees. In addition to problems of enforcing compliance with existing guidelines, the paper concludes that two areas - developing strategies to accommodate the realities of long-term, even permanent displacement and enhancing women's literal and legal literacy - require much greater attention on the part of governmental and non-governmental international organisations."
"February 19, 2009","This paper asks how we should regard the laws and customs of armed conflict, and specifically the rule prohibiting the targeting of civilians. What view should we take of the moral character and significance of such rules? Some philosophers have suggested that they are best regarded as useful conventions. This view is sometimes motivated by a ""deep moral critique"" of the rule protecting civilians: Jeff McMahan believes for example that the existing rules protect some who ought to be liable to attack (on account of their having voluntarily contributed to the injustice or aggression being resisted).  He thinks we would be better off with a different principle of discrimination in warfare. But McMahan acknowledges that for the time being we must stick with the rules that we have. The present paper does five things: (1) it explores and takes further some of McMahan's insights about the importance of existing positive law in this area; (2) it argues that some of the features that philosophers find problematic with the rule offering blanket protection to all civilians have to do with administrability; (3) it raises some questions about whether the rule protecting civilians can really be regarded as a convention (and it argues that certainly it cannot be regarded as a ""Lewis-convention"" in a strict sense); (4) to the extent that the rule can be regarded as conventional, the paper argues that it remains a  deadly serious moral rule, partly because of the circumstances of death and destruction in which it operates and which it tries to ameliorate, and partly on account of its fragility. The fifth point is the most important. (5) The rule protecting civilians does not operate in circumstances in which, apart form positive law, civilians like everyone would be liable to attack. The rule operates against a moral background in which all deliberate killing is to be regarded as murder; some deliberate killings (of combatants) are privileged in warfare; but the rule about civilians reflects the fact that this is a strictly limited privilege and that those who target civilians do not get the benefit of it. Changing our view of the default position in this way enables us to better understand the distinctive work that this rule does."
"February 19, 2009","The interrelated concepts of sovereignty, self-determination, and the territorial integrity of states form a Gordian knot at the core of public international law. This Article, written as part of a symposium on law and geography, considers how geographic concepts can be used to try to untangle - or slice through - this knot of issues."
"February 18, 2009","This paper studies the incidence of civil war over time. We put forward a canonical model of civil war, which relates the incidence of conflict to circumstances, institutions and features of the underlying economy and polity. We use this model to derive testable predictions and to interpret the cross-sectional and times-series variations in civil conflict. Our most novel empirical finding is that higher world market prices of exported, as well as imported, commodities are strong and significant predictors of higher within-country incidence of civil war."
"February 17, 2009","There has been more protest in the Chinese countryside than might have been expected in the repressive months following June 4, 1989.  This unrest has been triggered in part by that staple of contentious politics research: opportunity.  Leadership has also played a role.  How they are perceived by their followers and interested onlookers is critical for protest organizers.  Social recognition can steel an activist's resolve and lead to more protest.  Violence has also been on the rise of late, as have unplanned, accidental protests that rapidly take on a life of their own. But is rural China likely to explode?  Not likely.  Organization remains low and cross-class cooperation is still rare.  Claims tend to be circumscribed and popular action is usually small-scale and local.  That national leaders tolerate so much contention is actually an indicator of their confidence. Should the Center begin to treat farmers' grievances like those of Tibetans and Falun Gong supporters, then we will know that the leadership is shaken and the regime is weakening."
"February 15, 2009","The vast majority of indigenous rights disputes are currently advanced, and resolved, outside domestic courts. This paper, which will appear in the upcoming  book, ""Indigenous Peoples and the Law: Comparative and Critical Perspectives"", (Hart Publishing, Oxford), compares the out-of-court (""ADR"") processes that have been created to address indigenous land rights disputes in each of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  In contrast to the U.S. Indian Claims Commission model, each of Australia, Canada and New Zealand have developed ""hybrid"" ADR processes that leave considerable space for negotiation between the state and indigenous nations. Collectively, these ADR processes have produced a quantity and variety of outcomes not previously available through the courts in any of the countries."
"February 15, 2009","This paper, the first of a two-part analysis, reviews the history and legal basis of contemporary aboriginal land claims in Ontario. Placing those claims in the context of historical treaty-making between the Crown and First Nations, it reviews the historical treatment of aboriginal land rights in Canadian law and past systemic barriers to their resolution. The paper draws on previously unpublished data about the number and status of outstanding land claims within the provincial claims negotiation process to indicate the impracticability of relying on the Canadian courts to resolve the rising backlog of aboriginal claims."
"February 15, 2009","Part One of this paper, published separately in the Queen's Law Journal, described the nature and legal basis of aboriginal land claims in Ontario and historical barriers that impeded their resolution. This second part  reviews the adequacy of existing federal and provincial negotiation processes for addressing aboriginal  claims in Ontario. In light of the rising number and the age of unresolved claims within existing processes, the author proposes five criteria for measuring the effectiveness of  claims resolution processes in Canada, and identifies practical options for the design of improvements to the current model."
"February 15, 2009","As mediation gains in popularity as a tool for resolving disputes, and particularly as a substitute for court decisions, some have questioned mediation's ability to assure fairness of process and outcome. Others have argued that the main strength of mediation lies in the power it gives the parties to invent their own approach to resolving their dispute, leaving little room for mediators to impose their own notions of fairness on the process. This article examines the extent to which mediators have an obligation to address issues of fairness in the processes they manage. Through a functional and context-based analysis of mediation, the author proposes a problem-solving approach to resolving fairness concerns."
"February 13, 2009","This paper presents the method of ""Integrative Mediation"", a methodology for interethnic mediation at the local level in post-conflict areas developed. It focuses on South Eastern Europe, and it was developed by the CSSProject for Integrative Mediation, a registered non-profit organization based in Berlin, Germany. The paper provides an overview of the methodology, insights of a three-year project in Kosovo and Macedonia where it was applied, and lessons learned. The first section discusses deficiencies in existing literature. It argues that interethnic mediation is not the same as intercultural mediation in established democracies where there are legal norms and accepted institutions and requires its own field of study and practice-oriented literature. The second section presents Integrative Mediation as a holistic approach to conflict resolution focusing on the local level. It argues that to be effective mediation in ethnic conflicts must have a multi-discipline approach drawing on existing theory but tailor made to each conflict situation. The third section presents the results of Integrative Mediation in Kosovo and Macedonia. In the fourth section, lessons learned are presented. The paper concludes that interethnic mediation in post conflict areas is complex and chaotic but can be approached systematically."
"February 09, 2009","This paper seeks to review first if there exists a duty of confidentiality in international commercial arbitation and, if yes, what it its scope, nature and limitations. Drawing from this first analysis, this paper also reviews the strenght of the confidentiality argument in relationship with third parties. To that end, the paper examines various scenarios in which third parties may be faced with arbitration proceedings. In order to resolve the difficulties caused by a possible confidentiality duty resting upon the parties, the arbitrators or other parties, the paper reviews various solutions, drawing upon contract law and private international law."
"February 07, 2009","This article examines the employment of and rationale for administrative detention (known also as preventive detention) in Israel. The legal grounds which support the resort to administrative detention are first discussed. A brief examination of how this measure has been utilized by Israeli authorities against Palestinians follows. The employment of administrative detention against Jews in the struggle against political extremism is then considered. As a matter of both law and principle, the employment of administrative detention is unacceptable in democracies, with the only exception being at times of grave threat to a nation's security. A distinction is made between latent emergency and real emergency. In accordance with the principle that human rights which are suspended for the duration of hostilities should not continue to be suspended long after wars have ended, I submit that administrative detentions are called for only in narrowly circumscribed situations, when the measures to be implemented have been determined after careful examination of the evidence gathered against designated individuals. In the absence of such safeguards, criminal proceedings should be opened against persons allegedly involved in seditious and/or violent activities."
"February 06, 2009","The Supreme Court of Canada has often encouraged the Crown and Aboriginal parties to find negotiated solutions to their disputes. The complex social, political, economic and legal interests which are embedded in many sectors of the Canadian population are not best resolved in the context of legal proceedings. Courts should, however, do more than lament the lack of negotiations - they should make decisions that create incentives for high quality, effective dispute resolution processes."
"February 06, 2009","The threat to human rights posed by non-state actors is of increasing concern. The author addresses the international obligations of belligerents, national liberation movements and insurgent entities, looks at the growing demands that such armed groups respect human rights norms and considers some of the options for holding private military companies accountable with regard to human rights abuses. The argument developed throughout this article is that all sorts of non-state actors are increasingly expected to comply with principles of international human rights law."

"February 05, 2009","The states of the Western Balkans constitute a major source of 'soft security' threats to the EU. The EU attaches a great deal of importance to this subject, as reflected by the fact that justice and home affairs is officially one of the most prominent areas of cooperation in the region. This paper aims at elaborating on this process and poses as its key analytical question: What are the actual routes of influence through which the EU can bring these states closer to EU standards in justice and home affairs?"
"February 05, 2009","The EU can do little to achieve its policy objectives in its Eastern neighborhood without facing the issue of secessionist conflicts. This paper deals with EU policy towards Georgia and the secessionist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It discusses the reasons for and constraints on EU policies, their effects and perception in the secessionist entities. The paper concludes with recommendations on how the EU can contribute to conflict resolution in Georgia through a greater inclusion of the conflict regions into the European Neighborhood Policy."
"February 03, 2009","This article critically examines the rulings of the Indian Supreme Court in Centrotrade Metals and Minerals Inc. v Hindustan Copper Ltd  and Venture Global Engineering v Satyam Computer Services Ltd. The former vindicates the pro-enforcement stance of the New York Convention 1958, by holding that an award from international commercial arbitration conducted in any Convention country would be a foreign award irrespective of the proper law governing the arbitration agreement, while the latter has frustrated that objective by ruling that Indian courts can set aside foreign awards on the same grounds (e.g., patent illegality) as are applicable to domestic awards."
"February 02, 2009","The role of gender in negotiation has been extensively explored and documented in a now rich body of literature. A main strand of empirical evidence suggests that women, largely due to their gender socialization, tend to be weaker negotiators relative to men and consequently, less effective in pursuing their economic, social or family interests in diverse bargaining settings. We present findings from a Greek setting that paint a different picture, in which gender does not have a strong impact on the negotiating process when the negotiating parties are members of a competitive profession. We selected three different groups (Greek attorneys-at-law, Greek business students and a control group made up of young employees in public and private organizations) and distributed self-assessment questionnaires to test for negotiating style and gender-specific negotiation behavior. Our findings suggest that differences which may be attributed to gender are less pronounced for Greek legal practitioners. Stronger determinants of successful outcomes in negotiations are negotiators' individual characteristics (competitive negotiating style, persuasion, social and emotional intelligence) and the conformity of Greek lawyers of both sexes to the competitive group norms of their profession. Therefore, the shared norms and values of professional culture play a critical role in how lawyers negotiate. We discuss these findings in the context of a larger social setting, especially by reference to the changing hierarchies and shifts in power in a legal profession increasingly populated by women."
"February 02, 2009","Reviewing current work toward the development of cyberjustice through e-filing and integrated justice information systems, the paper analyses the challenges that lay ahead for the interoperability and standardization of the tools aimed at facilitating the judicial and extra-judicial treatment of disputes.  Having regard to the complexity of the relevant legal variables and information flow parameters, the paper suggests the use of a legal risk analysis framework and outlines some of its necessary features."
"February 02, 2009","This paper explores the challenges that information and communications technology bring to the rule of law in the context of adjudication. The historical core of the rule of law in the western tradition is first identified as the quest for a government of laws and not of men, a concept which sits most comfortably with legislation as the foremost source of law. The globalisation of the means of conflict resolution which has come with technological evolution is then used to highlight how the state is losing its grip not only on the means of dispute resolution but also on the substantive laws that govern outcomes. The significance of this for legal method is seen as the loss of the centrality of legislation, an increased reliance on the rationality of case law, and the rule of law reassessment that this requires."
"February 01, 2009","In the field of international commercial contracts, the move towards legal harmonization is seen mainly as a function of two vectorial forces: conventional uniform law and the lex mercatoria. In both cases, the decision-maker is frequently confronted by the silence of the law. By analysing the ways in which a decision-maker may resort to the general principles of law and trade usages to make the law speak, the author sets out the broad outlines of an attempt to help situate the sources of transnational law between law and contract on one hand, and between formal law and informal law on the other."
"February 01, 2009","Must the law of sustainable development be a different kind of law? Sustainable development law raises this question because it is directed toward a future which, being both distant and global, is particularly uncertain. This paper does not tackle this difficult question but modestly proposes some preliminary thoughts about the conflict resolution models that we know and the way in which they relate to law as it serves to connect past and future. My hypothesis is that what I will call the model of principles appears as the inevitable normative framework for sustainability disputes."
"February 01, 2009","To counteract the threat of potentially catastrophic cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure, policy makers are increasingly contemplating the use of deterrence strategies to supplement cyber-defense.  Deterrence has traditionally focused primarily on threatening a potential attacker with a punishing response in order to deter attacks from occurring.  However, because of the particular characteristics of cyberspace a general deterrence policy based on threatened retaliation may not be sufficient to deter, and, in some circumstances, may be counter-productive.  Thus, this chapter examines an expanded framework for cyber-deterrence policy that includes four factors: (1) penalty (the familiar notion of increasing the cost of attack through punishment), (2) futility (the notion of frustrating attack through resilience or recovery capabilities), (3) dependency (the notion of interdependence as a moderating influence), and (4) counter-productivity (the notion that collateral backlash can check behavior)."
"February 01, 2009","The secession of Kosovo from Serbia in February 2008 represents a stage in the unfolding of a revolution of ""constitutional"" dimensions in International Law that began with NATO's 1999 intervention in Kosovo against Serbia. NATO's intervention called into question the authority and viability of U.N. Charter system for maintaining international peace.  Likewise, the West's decision in 2008 to support Kosovo's secession from Serbia dealt a further blow to the central post-War legal rules and institutions for controlling and mitigating Great power rivalry.   Russia's later support for South Ossetia's secession from Georgia demonstrated the potential that the Kosovo precedent has for destabilizing the international legal order."
"January 31, 2009","The bulk of scholarly attention and energy devoted to the independence and impartiality of adjudicators today continues to focus on guarantees relating to domestic courts, even as the number and importance of international tribunals keep on growing.   Increasingly, such tribunals decide disputes previously left to domestic legislative, executive or judicial authorities.   These range from international commercial disputes, through investment disputes between states and private investors, to trade disputes between states.  These tribunals have been the subject of a push toward ""legalization,"" whereby features of domestic judicial processes and institutions are, consciously or not, exported to the international arena.   Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a preliminary look at independence and impartiality in the space beyond the state."
"January 31, 2009","This paper offers a justification of the principle of military proportionality that is based in considerations of self-interest. By offering such a justification, I hope to vindicate the principle on the basis of the least controversial argument available. The war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 is used as a case study. Part 1 surveys recent work on military proportionality and suggests that the importance of this principle has increased in the age of asymmetrical warfare. Part 2 considers and rejects the traditional realist concerns about proportionality. Part 3 offers a realist rationale for adhering to the principle."
"January 31, 2009","Until recently, both courts and dispute resolvers have viewed negotiation and adjudication as two separate processes. What occurred in one process was considered largely irrelevant to what went on in the other. Recently, however, there has been a growing recognition that both processes must work together to resolve disputes over Aboriginal lands and resources. This paper weaves together the emerging trends in court decisions with the new thinking on dispute system design to set out a framework that maximizes the strengths of each process. In this framework, the courts are responsible not only for adjudicating on the substance of Aboriginal and treaty rights, but also for establishing standards for the negotiation process itself, thereby increasing the likelihood of a fair and durable resolution."
"January 31, 2009","This paper briefly explores the possibility and limitations of a common European foreign and security policy (CFSP). It concludes that, contrary to the recieved wisdom, a the material basis for a viable CFSP does in fact already exist due to national security policies such as the French Force d'Action Rapide (FAR), and similar rapid reaction forces. However while the material base needed for a CFSP does exist, the political unity and will to employ such forces does not yet exist. However as time passes the possibility of a viable unified CFSP will increase as the functionalist processes of the EU gradually transform the potential of an EU CFSP into reality."
"January 26, 2009","The permeation of radical Islam in Chechnya has served a multi-faceted function. It has been the vehicle of separatist resistance, a platform of political strife and conflict, a source of funding and external support and a unifying ideological principle that, in its various interpretations, has brought both hope and destruction for the Chechen society. More often than not, Islam served as a political-ideological tool that brought the promise of legitimacy and was the main source of contention between the Chechen political factions. For 21st century Russia, radical Islam in Chechnya provided a different type of challenge - one that turned into an opportunity for justifying its counter-terrorist operations in the Caucasus."
"January 25, 2009","The international legal system encompasses a variety of legal norms, but the perceived increase in ""fragmentation"" of these norms has recently been seen as a problem for the system as a whole. Consequently, many writers have suggested forms of increased comity among international tribunals in order to combat the problems associated with fragmentation; indeed, locating harmonies among international legal regimes within a coherent international legal system appears to be the dominant trend. Yet these perspectives dismiss, or at the very least, largely overlook, the benefits of competition among international tribunals."
"January 22, 2009","There is no part in the world without violence. The violence has therefore become a  dreadful pandemic in the world. The violence hurt both rich and poor countries. There are a number of ways in which economic networks can add to regional conflicts. Regional trade routes may be a means by which conflict goods can escape formal sanction, enabling neighboring states to derive revenue from one state's civil conflict and the resulting establishment of trade restrictions. This paper analyses the various issues that cause the armed conflict and violence. It also provides some examples of the countries that suffer from armed conflict in Africa and other parts of the world."
"January 22, 2009","This paper proposes to define domestic violence as a binary variable and explores the possibilities to estimate and forecast it in the Indian circumstances."
"January 22, 2009","I discuss several forms of bias, or fallacious thinking, that lead to parochialism, that is, a willingness to sacrifice self-interest for in-group members while neglecting or underweighing negative effects on outsiders, so that an out-group could lose more than the in-group gains from the sacrifice. In the self-interest illusion, people fallaciously think that their contribution to their group comes back to benefit them and make their sacrifice worthwhile. This illusion is larger when an outgroup is affected, and it is specific to group benefits; it is unrelated to the desire to hurt another group out of sheer competition. A second bias is the tendency to de-personalize the individuals involved and think about the groups.  This is reduced when people make analogous decisions about individuals. I suggest that approval voting -- at least when both groups vote -- can lead people to take the out-group into account. Omission bias, the preference for harming others through omissions rather than actions, is greater for out-group members. Parochialism can be moralized: people think of it as absolute and objectively moral, they are willing to impose it moralistically on others, and they consider the support of the in-group to be their duty as citizens. I conclude with suggestions for reducing the harmful effects of parochialism."
"January 22, 2009","Confidentiality is often cited as one of the main benefits of arbitration as opposed to litigation.  Yet, scholars and practitioners often fail to examine exactly why confidentiality is important.  We also do not carefully weigh the benefits and costs of making arbitration confidential, whether we are talking about public or private international arbitration."
"January 19, 2009","This 2007 article (based around an invited conference talk at Wayne State in early 2007) addresses risk assessment and cost benefit analysis as mechanisms in counterterrorism policy.  It argues that although policy is often best pursued by agreeing to set aside deep foundational differences, in order to obtain a strategic plan for an activity such as counterterrorism, foundational differences must be addressed in order that policy not merely devolve into a policy minimalism that is always and damagingly tactical, never strategic, in order to avoid domestic democratic political conflict.  The article takes risk assessment in counterterrorism, using cost benefit analysis, as an example of a foundational disagreement that cannot easily be elided.  Examining an extreme, indeed crude, recent example of cost benefit analysis applied to the risks of terror and the costs of counterterrorism - John Mueller's widely noticed Overblown - the article suggests that cost benefit analysis, at least applied in this way, runs roughshod over other important values in counterterrorism policy, such as justice, but in addition, makes radical yet unstated assumptions about what cost benefit analysis seeks to compare in establishing counterterrorism policy or estimating the risks and costs of terrorism - unstated assumptions that, in fact, assume the conclusion.  The article notes that cost benefit analysis tends to promote a policy-minimalizing ""event specific catastrophism"" - seeking above all to prevent simply the next, serial terrorist attack, with however no greater strategic vision.  Indeed, the article says in conclusion (as Philip Bobbitt has noted) cost benefit analysis is ""relentlessly tactical,"" not strategic; it also tends toward serial 'event specific catastrophism' as its analytic frame; and it is a method of evaluating proposed courses of action, not generating them, and hence promotes a strategically questionable tendency to reaction as a response to terrorism.  This article presents these ideas in brief fashion, however, as the first draft in a larger project on cost benefit analysis and counterterrorism, and it does so by reference to a book that is unabashedly crude in its approach to both cost benefit analysis and terrorism/counterterrorism.  The critical project will extend beyond this particular article, which is in effective a a first pass at developing a critique.  It is also an article that does not extend beyond events of early 2007 (when the original address was given) and should be read in that light."
"January 18, 2009","This article looks at the role of genocide in Rwanda history and contemporary politics and considers how both democracy, justice and reconciliation has been dealt with by the post genocidial government. The dissertation considers that there have been three main failings in Rwanda that will cause the repeat of violence in the region- failure to learn from the past, the failure to ensure impartial justice and democracy, and the failure of the international community. Collectively these failings, unless they are addressed, have the potential to cause another genocide to re-occur again in the country. The main obstacle to reconciliation within Rwanda is the RPF hegemony which has not only manipulated democracy and justice but also international justice mechanisms and carried its campaign into the Congo in order to consolidate its power. Lessons need to be learnt, both from mistakes of the past and in neighbouring countries in order to prevent atrocities in the future. Rwanda shows how imposing victor's justice and hegemonic government does not bring about peace and reconciliation as Rwanda's past has shown. There is a need for both sides to be held to account and good governance in order to ensure lasting peace and prevent the return to the past."
"January 18, 2009","The Spratlys are a scattered group of islands in the South China Sea over which China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei have made conflicting jurisdictional claims. Although there has been significant academic discussion of this dispute, the Author argues that much of it is hampered by a discourse obsessed with the regional balance of power and security-related strategies that are only tenuously related to each nation's specific legal claims in the Spratlys. In this Article, the Author suggests that a more productive approach to the Spratly disputes is one focused on finding a solution that is fair to all the parties. The Article then examines several distinct substantive notions of fairness potentially applicable to the Spratly disputes and applies these notions to various existing proposed solutions, ultimately rejecting proposals that call for an allocation of rights in the Spratlys. Finally, the Author proposes that a multilateral management authority might satisfy each party's interest in fairness, at least in terms of participation in the ongoing process of allocation."
"January 18, 2009","The song has been playing a pivotal role in present developing societies like Eritrea. Thus the music is considered as the language of a common man. The songs of Eritrea touched all feelings of life of the people and inspired them to advance the nation's construction and reconstruction process. Eritrean life is tinge of different feelings and values such as Love, Agony, Patriotism, Mercy, generosity etc. The songs are however fused Eritreans to unite and to fight against their enemy. The song should blossom and spread the fragrance of people's culture to the generations. An attempt is made in this paper to study the importance of the song and its impact on Eritrean struggle for independence and also the present border conflict situation. It provides a summary analysis of the song its evolution and progress over a long period."
"January 18, 2009","We demonstrate that citizens perceive a duty to support policies that benefit their nation, even when they themselves judge that the consequences of the policies will be worse on the whole, taking outsiders into account. Hypothetical choices follow this perceived duty and do not violate it for the sake of better consequences. The  discrepancy between duty and judged consequences does not seem to result from self-interest alone. When asked for reasons, many subjects felt an obligation to help their fellow citizens before others, and they also thought that they owed something to their  nation, in return for what it did for them. The obligation to help fellow citizens was the strongest predictor of perceived duty. In an experiment with Israeli and Palestinian students, group membership affected both perceived overall consequences and duty, although subjects still showed a greater group duty than predicted by perceived consequences."
"January 16, 2009","This short essay briefly traces the evolution of trade law enforcement from the the GATT to the WTO regime. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) is widely viewed as a major innovation from the GATT regime in that it subordinates unilateral enforcement of trade law to a rule-based system of multilateral enforcement. I recognize the successes of the WTO regime but the institution effective permits (if not encourages) the unilateral enforcement of trade law outside of the DSU framework  Specifically, I examine how the DSU system only provides a prospective remedy - that is, the DSU permits retaliation only for injuries that take place after the WTO litigation is concluded. The DSU thus immunizes violations of WTO trade law from retaliatory sanctioning so long as the offending measures are withdrawn at the end of the litigation process, which is often several years later. This immunity, which I refer to as the ""stall-and-withdraw"" loophole, leaves injured governments with no immediate remedy for WTO violations under the DSU system, regardless of how great the trade effects of the violation are. I suggest that the institutional design of the DSU effectively creates a need for the unilateral enforcement of trade rules and, oddly, provides legal protection for unilateral sanctions. I conclude by attempting to provide a view of the DSU that acknowledges its advances from its origins in the GATT regime but acknowledge its inability to completely control unilateral retaliation."
"January 15, 2009","The U.S. Navy faces uncertainty about the degree to which it will have to prepare for a high-end future conflict against a powerful, well-armed opponent versus the so-called Long War against rogue nations and terrorist organizations. The answer depends to a large extent on the evolution of U.S. relations with China and Iran and the future of the United States itself. To help the Navy understand how critical near-, mid-, and far-term trends in the United States, China, and Iran might influence U.S. security decisions in general and the Navy's allocation of resources in particular, RAND examined emerging nonmilitary trends in each of the three countries. The authors investigated current and projected domestic developments in the areas of demographics, economics, energy consumption, the environment, and education. They also examined each country's relations with its so-called near abroad to determine how much of a challenge each of the three nations (plus Japan and Russia) will experience in their own immediate ""neighborhoods."""
"January 12, 2009","In this essay written in honor of the retirement of Eddy Wymeersch, Professor Howell Jackson explores the manner in which European nations have moved towards more consolidated systems of financial regulation and discusses the implications of the European experience for the United States.  While U.S. policy debates over regulatory reform often reduce to theoretical claims regarding the benefits and pitfalls of consolidation, the consolidation of oversight within the  members states of the European Union offers many concrete examples of how consolidated supervision actually works.  European experience demonstrates that there are many different ways in which to implement consolidated regulation, and often times the process of consolidation occurs gradually over a number of years.  In addition to the expected advantages of increased efficiency and the elimination of regulatory gaps, European experience suggests that consolidated regulatory agencies often attract higher quality personnel and do a better job maintaining consistency across different sectors of the financial services industry.  In addition, European reforms have devised a number of mechanisms to ensure that consolidated agencies remain politically accountable and resolve policy conflicts in an efficient and timely manner."
"January 10, 2009","Democratic peace, the liberal concept that democracies do not (or rarely) fight each other was once claimed by Jack Levy as the 'closest thing we have to a law in international politics' (1988). Tracing its roots to Kant's 1795 treatise, 'Perpetual Peace', the democratic peace thesis has been the bone of contention in the academia for decades. Several scholars have empirically validated it (see, e.g. Doyle, 1986; Russett, 1995; Maoz and Russett, 1993,) while others have refuted and sought to debunk the thesis with like vigour (see, e.g. Spiro, 1996; Layne, 1996; Rosato, 2003). However, what appears to be more pressing at the moment is its induction into policy-making, subsequent to the rise of the neoconservatives in the American domestic milieu. The purpose of this paper is to trace the odyssey of the democratic peace thesis from the confines of the academia to the corridors of policy-making in the United States and its impact thereafter."
"January 08, 2009","This paper seeks to build upon earlier works analyzing U.S. federal and state legislation that conflict with the United States' obligations under international agreements. Several of these earlier works conclude that such conflicting legislation violates the Constitution on a variety of grounds, and is therefore legally invalid."
"January 08, 2009","The presence of a resource like oil which is the mainstay of a multi ethnic state in the lands of minority peoples is guaranteed to generate conflicts as to the ownership control and benefits of the exploration and exploitation of the resource. These conflicts implicate the human rights of these minorities in their individual and group capacities such that to resolve these conflicts a number of measures are usually adopted by the State to recognize, promote, and protect the interests of these minorities. This paper reviews the measures employed by the Nigerian State to protect the ethnic minorities in the Niger Delta and interrogates whether measures targeted at these ethnic minorities or the whole country are appropriate against the background of worsening separatist and militant agitation."
"January 08, 2009","Eighty-five percent of the Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem are deemed illegal under Israeli planning laws for being built without adequate building permits. This implies that since 1967, approximately 20,000 buildings were built by Palestinians in East Jerusalem without acquiring sufficient building permits. Between 1987 and 2004, Israel demolished 400 (2.4 percent) of these houses. Through a detailed analysis of some 30 in-depth interviews conducted with Israeli bureaucrats and with Palestinian residents in Jerusalem, this article explores the institution of illegality within the Israeli planning discourse. In particular, the article examines how techniques of illegality based on planning laws and policy are utilized to dominate the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem."
"January 08, 2009","This paper explores the territorial dimensions of enduring internal rivalries (EIRs), which are defined as protracted domestic violent conflicts between governments and insurgent groups. It argues that the nature of domestic-level territorial conflicts, such as tactical advantages facing the rebels, allow the fighting to continue. Three specific hypotheses flow from this argument including that territorial disputes are likely to evolve into EIRs and that territorial EIRs are more likely to recur and produce shorter peace spells than other types of domestic conflict. We test these hypotheses by conducting statistical analyses of 220 internal armed conflicts and find robust and substantively strong empirical support. This article suggests that territorial issues should be studied from an enduring, protracted standpoint for their effect on domestic conflict to be fully appreciated. It also offers new insights into how territory matters and suggests that territorial issues are not simply reducible to the concerns of ethnicity and identity in explaining protracted civil wars, as much of the conventional wisdom suggests."
"January 08, 2009","This article comes at a moment of profound questioning as to the possibility that Israelis and Palestinians will reach a negotiated permanent resolution to the conflict between them. Similarly, after years of intense activity and experimentation, the field of international justice and transitional justice also seems engaged in a process of self-critique with the aim of continuing its evolution. In particular, skepticism has grown regarding the international community's continued blind faith preference for establishing internationalized, individual criminal prosecutions that focus primarily on high-level perpetrators. This article seizes this critical moment as an opportunity to see what each of these troubled areas can do for the other by examining whether transitional justice has a place in the Israeli-Palestinian post-conflict, and if so, what form it should take. It is hoped that by recasting the former in light of the latter - i.e., by attempting to fit the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into the transitional paradigm-that new challenges to the transitional construct will reveal themselves and challenges not apparent in other contexts will appear more pronounced, thus fueling further evolution of the transitional paradigm.  In particular, the Israeli-Palestinian context presents challenging issues regarding the large beneficiary and collaborator classes in both societies."
"January 05, 2009","While much of the extant literature has focused on the potential of international rivers to generate militarized conflict, this study builds on more recent works that examine the politics of river cooperation. The article focuses on the efforts to regulate the use of international rivers formally by the means of treaties. The theoretical framework incorporates prominent variables from the (neo)realist and neoliberal schools of thought as well as the need for potable water and river-related geographic factors. The framework is used to generate expectations about whether riparian countries will enter into the treaties dealing in particular with the issues of water quantity and quality. Systematic empirical evaluations covering the entire world in the 1948-2000 time period confirm some while challenging much of the conventional wisdom on the topic. Specifically, preponderant power distribution, economic interdependence, democratic governance, and water scarcity all increase the chances for formalized river cooperation between contiguous riparian states. In contrast, the findings suggest that the roles of allegedly important and problematic factors such as the upstream/downstream relationship and recent militarized conflict have been exaggerated in earlier research. Cumulatively, the findings sound a cautiously optimistic note for the prospects of the spread of formal river cooperation in the less developed parts of the world."
"January 04, 2009","This study finds that North Korea's nuclear test and the imposition of UN Security Council sanctions have had no perceptible effect on North Korea's trade with its two largest partners, China and South Korea. Before North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test, it was widely believed that such an event would have cataclysmic diplomatic ramifications. However, beginning with visual inspection of data and ending with time-series models, no evidence is found to support the notion that these events have had any effect on North Korea's trade with its two principal partners."
"January 02, 2009","Cutting a cake -- or any heterogeneous, divisible good -- fairly has received much attention in recent years, but fair division of a pie into wedge-shaped sectors has received far less. Whereas cake-cutting is applicable to land division, pie-cutting is more applicable to the division of an island's shoreline into connected lots, or a daily cycle into on-call periods. Unlike cake division, we show that there may be no envy-free and efficient division of a pie among n players using n radial cuts (the minimum number), nor may there be an envy-free allocation that is equitable (each player receives the same value in its measure), though an envy-free and equitable allocation is always possible. Thus, pie-cutting is harder than cake-cutting - not a piece of cake."
"January 02, 2009","We study the problem of dissolving an equal-entitlement partnership when the objective is to minimize maximum regret. We initially focus on the family of linear-pricing mechanisms and derive regret-optimizing strategies. We also demonstrate that there exist linear-pricing mechanisms satisfying ex-post efficiency. Next, we analyze a binary-search mechanism which is ex-post individually rational. We discuss connections with the standard Bayesian-Nash framework for both linear and binary-search mechanisms. On a more general level, we show that if entitlements are unequal, ex-post efficiency and ex-post individual rationality impose significant restrictions on permissible mechanisms. In particular, they rule out both linear and binary-search mechanisms."
"December 29, 2008","Policy challenges associated with national and international freshwater systems have attracted increasing academic attention in recent years. In practical terms, freshwater is one of humanity’s most valuable and vulnerable natural resources. Surface waters, such as rivers and lakes, which are the most accessible sources for human consumption and use, constitute only a tiny fraction of water on Earth. Only 2.5 percent of global water (1,365 x 10^6 cubic kilometres) is freshwater (i.e., 35 x 10^6 cubic kilometres). Of those 2.5 percent, 0.3 percent is stored in rivers and lakes, 30.8 percent in groundwater, and 68.9 percent in glaciers and permanent snow cover (most of it in inaccessible places, such as Antarctica). Of the approximately 110,000 cubic kilometres of precipitation per year over land, around 42,000 are river runoff."
"December 24, 2008","In this article I analyse the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Boumediene v. Bush against the background of the discussion concerning the extraterritorial scope of the U.S. Constitution. The long-standing discussion about the scope of constitutional rights is situated within the theoretical framework elaborated by Gerald Neuman who distinguishes between membership models, universalism, 'global due process' and the model of 'mutual obligations'. The last model, which is based on a limited government perspective tends towards the ideal of judicial cosmopolitanism. I argue that Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court does not live up to the cosmopolitan ideal of the model of mutual obligations as it was elaborated in Justice Brennan's dissent in Verdugo and that Kennedy's casuistic and flexible approach lends itself to possible manipulation. I argue that this danger can be reduced by adopting the minimum standards of international law as a second order framework for constitutional interpretation and I show that the ethical nexus between effective control and responsibility is common to the normative model of mutual obligations, on the one hand, and to the framework adopted in European human rights law and international humanitarian law, on the other."
"December 24, 2008","Democracy resolves conflicts in difficult games like Prisoners' Dilemma and Chicken by stabilizing their cooperative outcomes. It does so by transforming these games into games in which voters are presented with a choice between a cooperative outcome and a Pareto-inferior noncooperative outcome. In the transformed game, it is always rational for voters to vote for the cooperative outcome, because cooperation is a weakly dominant strategy independent of the decision rule and the number of voters who choose it. Such games are illustrated by 2-person and n-person public-goods games, in which it is optimal to be a free rider, and a biblical story from the book of Exodus."
"December 21, 2008","This paper summarizes a two-year project working with risk management specialists in finance, health care, political risk, engineering, and other fields to understand how risk management applies to intelligence and international security affairs.  It distinguishes between two broad approaches for risk management implementation in complex organizations (large companies, the U.S. intelligence community).  Tactical approaches focus on particular models (VaR, option theory, fault trees, etc.) while strategic approaches take an enlarged view of key managerial and contextual factors which shape the actual use of risk management.  As environments become more turbulent, managers should focus far more on these strategic, rather than tactical approaches to managing risk."
"December 19, 2008","In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the Department of Defense (""DoD"") convinced Congress that compliance with environmental and natural resource laws hampered the Armed Forces' readiness for combat by limiting use of its training ranges.  This Article evaluates whether Congress's post-9/11 exemptions to three important natural resource laws are inefficient, unjust, and/or unwise by examining the effects these laws have had on national security and their real impacts on the natural world.  The significance of these exemptions is reflected by the magnitude of the military's land holdings -- over 32 million acres providing habitat for 300 species listed under the Endangered Species Act.  Given the potential impacts, DoD has not demonstrated that the exemptions are necessary or appropriate under the current circumstances, and, in fact, evidence suggests they have been harmful.  Application of the precautionary principle exhorts that decisionmakers should protect these resources even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established.  Abandoning protection of the country's natural resources, treasures that make this country worth defending, in the name of national security deserves greater thought and study, particularly given the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Navy sonar case and the Marine Corps' request to expand its bombing and training range in the Mojave Desert."
"December 19, 2008","On the night of March 21st, 2006, a 27 year-old man, Thanakorn Pakdeepol, took a hammer and smashed the image of the Hindu deity Brahma - whom the Thai call Thao Maha Phrom - near the Erawan hotel in Bangkok. The destruction took place just before the political crisis centering on Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister, reached a climax with the subsequently-discredited election of 2 April 2006. Because the shrine had long been the most significant non-Buddhist shrine in Bangkok, its destruction immediately led both anti- and pro-Thaksin supporters to interpret the act as an omen. In this paper I use the story of the destruction of the Erawan shrine, which I believe can be seen as a watershed event in the crisis surrounding Thaksin. It is also part of the story of the role of the occult in Thaksin's loss of power in the coup of 19 September 2006."
"December 18, 2008","The fall of the Berlin Wall appeared to herald a new era of rights. Yet, just three years later, the disintegration of Yugoslavia into war and brutal ethnic cleansing left Europe, the U.S., and the U.N. struggling to find ways to meaningfully and legally intervene to make good on their ""never again"" pledge to prevent genocide. Unfortunately, the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia became a crucible for the international community's efforts. This chapter offers a victim's perspective of the entire process."
"December 18, 2008","This essay sketches the constitutional dormancy of Missouri v. Holland and the potential for its activation.  The essay first describes how the treatymakers declined the Treaty Power offered them by the Court.  In the near century since the ruling, no treaty appears to have depended on the decision for authority.  The treatymakers have worked from contrary constitutional premises, establishing a sort of parallel constitutional universe in which the ruling was never handed down.  Through these years, Missouri v. Holland has failed accurately to represent prevailing constitutional norms on the question.  In other words, arguably the decision is no longer good law if it ever was."
"December 17, 2008","We investigate, using the 2002 US Health and Retirement Study, the factors influencing individuals’ insecurity and expectations about terrorism, and study the effects these last have on households’ portfolio choices and spending patterns. We find that females, the religiously devout, those equipped with a better memory, the less educated, and those living close to where the events of September 2001 took place worry a lot about their safety. In addition, fear of terrorism discourages households from investing in stocks, mostly through the high levels of insecurity felt by females. Insecurity due to terrorism also makes single men less likely to own a business. Finally, we find evidence of expenditure shifting away from recreational activities that can potentially leave one exposed to a terrorist attack and towards goods that might help one cope with the consequences of terrorism materially (increased spending on the house) or psychologically (spending on personal care products by females in couples)."
"December 16, 2008","The conflict in northern Uganda has gone on for more than two decades despite efforts to have a peaceful settlement. The latest attempt to have a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Northern Uganda has culminated in the Juba peace talks on the conflict in northern Uganda, where the government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) on February 19, 2008, signed an important annex to their June 29, 2007, agreement on principles for accountability and reconciliation. The annex provides measures to implement the June 29 agreement, which include trials for the most serious crimes and a truth commission, reparations, and traditional justice practices."
"December 15, 2008","The history of United Nations peacekeeping is frequently one of failure. The causes are endemic, persistent and unlikely to be remedied. It seems reasonable to consider two ideas in response: whether ad hoc peacekeepers might be augmented or even replaced by competent contract labour; and whether well-trained contractors might in future subdue by force those who inflict gross human rights abuses on others. Alternatives to ad hoc forces are not new. Nevertheless, theoretical or practical substitutes have not been evaluated alongside the merits of a private corporation supported by a business model. Military contractors are frequently represented as an affront to states’ authority. This is misleading. There has never been a clear divide between public and private resources in armed conflict and states have always employed both. There exists no compelling reason in law why the UN should not devise modern contracts that evolve from historically ubiquitous arrangements amongst its members and their more ancient predecessors. Formidable hurdles remain. Nonetheless, the deployment of disciplined, professional contractors under rigorous conditions may offer improvements on present standards of peacekeeping. This would enable the Security Council to better address its Charter responsibilities and, in particular, the Preamble and its admonition on war."
"December 15, 2008","Theories of violence have traditionally predicted that bystanders are less likely to intervene when in the presence of others than when alone. We re-examine this prediction using data from 42 episodes of public violence in ""night-time economy"" spaces in the United Kingdom, as captured on CCTV cameras. The behaviors of protagonists and bystanders were coded as either escalating or de-escalating acts, and the resulting interaction sequences were examined using state-transition diagrams. Analyses revealed that bystanders play a key role in shaping the trajectory of violence. They contributed more de-escalating than escalating behaviors; and their de-escalating behavior became more rather than less prevalent with more bystanders. This appeared to result from two dynamics: i) bystander interventions usually begin with a de-escalating act towards the target rather than the instigator; and ii) the third bystander act in the sequence was most likely to determine the trajectory of the violence. We conclude with some speculations about the intra-group regulation of violence, and highlight bystanders as an important resource for developing violence reduction initiatives."
"December 15, 2008","These are violent times we live in. Each and every day, internet sites, newspapers, and television and radio stations report the gruesome details of violence run amok. The majority of critical incidents reported by the media are human-made situations (although critical incidents also arise from natural disasters as well). Such human-induced incidents can range from a disgruntled employee barricaded in the lunchroom at work to a cult confrontation such as the tragedy in Waco, Texas that resulted in the fiery deaths of 81 Branch Davidians. A critical incident can also include a single, suicidal individual with a gun to mass casualty scenarios, such as the calculated and planned bombings on the London mass transit system on July 7, 2006 in which fifty-six people were killed (including four homicide bombers) and 700 injured and the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C., resulting in the deaths of over 3,000 innocent victims. Critical incidents can be planned to the smallest detail or impulsively ignited (e.g., road rage). They can arise from any type of unsatisfactory encounter, including a robbery, a domestic dispute, an angry confrontation in the workplace, a family argument, and even a casual misunderstanding in a restaurant, bar, or sporting event. A critical incident can involve a subject who is reported to have a weapon and has barricaded him/herself in a room or building. An incident can also be a hostage situation whereby individuals are held against their will in order to attain some identified, instrumental goal or a non-hostage event in which individuals are held against their will and are victims to the subject's emotional state (G.W. Noesner, 1999). Common across this wide variety of incident characteristics, however, is that these potentially deadly situations are often resolved either through negotiation or through a tactical solution."
"December 15, 2008","Amidst the vast literature on social conflict, there are a few basic theoretical models that have helped advance the understanding and practice of constructive conflict resolution. Among these, one of the most important and influential is Deutsch's theory of conflict resolution (1973, 2006). Based on his earlier work on cooperation and competition in groups (Deutsch, 1949a, 1949b), it specified the basic conditions and processes involved in constructive versus destructive conflict. However, the original formulation of the theory assumed equal power of the parties in conflict (Johnson and Johnson, 2005). Thus, the dynamics and outcomes observed in a majority of the empirical studies supporting the theory occurred under conditions of relatively equal power between the parties. The assumption of equal power therefore constrains both the theoretical scope and practical implications of the theory. Although there have been important advances in research on the dynamics of asymmetries of power and conflict (see Blalock, 1989; Deutsch, 1973; Kim, Pinkley, and Fragale, 2005; Rouhana and Fiske, 1995; Rubin and Brown, 1975; Tjosvold, 1981, 1985, 1989, 1991; Tjosvold, Coleman and Sun, 2003; Zartman and Rubin, 2002), the findings in this area have been replete with contradictions and have resulted in a good deal of conceptual confusion (Zartman and Rubin, 2002). This paper will present three studies investigating a new social-psychological model of the dynamics of power and conflict. The model builds on the works of Lewin (1951), Deutsch (1949a, 1949b, 1973, 1982, 1985), and Kelly and Thibaut (Thibaut and Kelly, 1959; Kelly and Thibaut, 1978; Kelly, 1979, 1984, 1991) on interdependence, and of McClelland (1975) on social power. The three studies presented in this paper will include: 1) an exploratory study of survey data on how conflict behaviors differ when negotiating across different levels of power, 2) qualitative research with focus groups exploring the implications of differences in power and interdependence for conflict rules and behaviors, and 3) an experimental study that will test hypotheses derived from the theoretical model. This paper will have three sections: (1) a summary of the main principles and limitations of Deutsch's theory of conflict resolution, (2) a presentation of the main propositions of the model of power and conflict, and (3) a discussion of the implications of the research for future work in the area."
"December 14, 2008","This article evaluates civil liability for financial institutions that provide material support to terrorist organizations. Part I of this article analyzes the development of the ATA and related legislation proscribing material support to terrorist groups, highlighting the evolving statutory construction by looking to the body of case law surrounding lawsuits against the terrorist support network. Part II examines the issue of terrorist financing generally, taking into consideration the challenges facing financial institutions. Finally, Part III analyzes the term ""financial services"" in the context of material support prohibitions, referencing the ongoing litigation against financial institutions under the ATA. Using the lawsuit filed on behalf of Daniel Pearl as a case study, this article concludes that a broad interpretation of the statute is not only in line with the legislative intent of the ATA, but is also the only way in which it can be effective in halting terrorist financing."
"December 14, 2008","Despite intense research on intractable conflicts their dynamical properties are not well understood, and in many respects they appear paradoxical. The defining characteristic of intractable conflicts is stability and resistance to intervention, yet this stability is maintained by underlying volatile dynamics. The dynamical systems approach provides tools to understand how high stability can emerge from dynamics. This paper examines which features of intractable conflict may be explained by the dynamical implantation of one of the most general laws in the social domain the Crude Law of Social Relations formulated by Morton Deutsch. Results of computer simulations show that the Crude Law applied to describe individual interactions produces rich dynamics at the group level with many emergent properties that were not anticipated to result from the crude law. It dynamics resembles autocatalytic dynamics of exponential growth, characteristic for many growth processes. When the growth involves negative elements, under certain conditions conflicts may escalate to intractability, the conflict forms s self-sustaining system, and captures the dynamics of the society where it exists. Many features of intractable conflicts are reproduced by the model. The results of simulations also suggest that local conditions may be critical for conflicts to reach the level of intractability and indicate possible scenarios for transformation of intractable conflicts. The article also shows how models built in the tradition of dynamical minimalism can turn general psychological theories into precise formal models which exhibit many emergent properties."
"December 14, 2008","This article addresses an aspect of one of the most controversial issues in the field of state succession: whether there is a succession of states to obligations arising from an internationally wrongful act committed by the predecessor state against a third state before the ""date of succession."" More specifically, the article addresses the issue in the context of secession: who from the continuing state or the new state (the ""secessionist"" successor state) should he held responsible for the obligation to repair towards the injured third state after the date of succession.  There are basically two possible answers to this question: the obligation remains that of the continuing state or the obligation is transferred to the new state."
"December 14, 2008","Debate continues over the value of organizational conflict. Researchers from one tradition emphasize its constructive role in improving performance. Those from a second dispute this and emphasize its destructive effects on outcomes like satisfaction. I argue this divergence primarily reflects narrow theoretical conceptions of conflict by each that are easily reconciled. An integrative model is proposed which describes the transformation of conflict over time and source using Pondy's (1967) stage model and the task versus relationship conflict distinction (Jehn, 1995). Initial empirical support for the model via a natural experiment was strong. The results replicate and integrate past findings of two diverse traditions under a unified conceptual model. The methodology illustrates the use of multilevel analysis in the study of conflict."

"December 10, 2008","Civil war is the most prevalent form of large-scale violence and is massively destructive to life, society, and the economy. The prevention of civil war is therefore a key priority for international attention. We present an empirical analysis of what makes countries prone to civil war. Using a global panel data set we examine different determinants of civil war for the period 1960-2004. We find little evidence that motivation can account for civil war risk but we suggest that there is evidence to support our feasibility hypothesis: that where a rebellion is financially and militarily feasible it will occur."
"December 09, 2008","In the course of history, a large number of politicians have been assassinated. Rational choice hypotheses are developed and tested using panel data covering more than 100 countries over a period of 20 years. Several strategies, in addition to security measures, are shown to significantly reduce the probability of politicians being attacked or killed: extended institutional and governance quality, democracy, voice and accountability, a well functioning system of law and order, decentralization via the division of power and federalism, larger cabinet size and strengthened civil society. There is also support for a contagion effect."
"December 08, 2008","This Article examines and critiques media portraits of the Middle East and Middle-Eastern Americans by tracing the alarming impact of this last minstrel show on public policy and the war on terrorism  The Article begins by analyzing racial profiling's problematic discourse of legitimation, deracinating its unsound roots and charting the intricate relationship between representation and reality in the narration of the Middle-Eastern threat, especially after 9/11.  The Article then examines the instrumental role of the mass media in both ossifying and perpetuating stereotypes that have rationalized policies targeting individuals of Middle-Eastern descent. Drawing on specific examples from the movies, television, music, publishing and advertising, the Article highlights the accretive impact of entertainment content on the epistemology of fear and the grave and under appreciated toll of such representations on the Middle-Eastern American community.  Finally, the Article also calls for some modest but concrete reforms in the entertainment industry as a starting point for providing more balanced depictions of the Middle East and of Middle-Eastern Americans."
"December 08, 2008","This article examines the application of a structural innovation known as Incident Command Systems (ICS) in different crises. The ICS seeks to coordinate multiple response organizations under a temporary hierarchical structure. The ICS is of practical interest because it has become the dominant mechanism by which crisis response is organized in the United States. It is of theoretical interest because it provides insights into how a highly centralized mode of network governance operates. Despite the hierarchical characteristics of the ICS, the network properties of crisis response fundamentally affects its operations, in terms of the coordination difficulties that multiple members bring, the ways in which authority is shared and contested between members, and the importance of trust in supplementing formal modes of control."
"December 08, 2008","Among the most notorious anti-terror techniques used by the U.S. government in the ""War on Terror"" are two shrouded in secrecy: extraordinary rendition and enforced disappearances.  Extraordinary rendition entails the transfer of an individual for interrogation in a country known for the use of torture.  Enforced disappearances occur when individuals are deprived of their liberty by state agents, who then fail to provide information about their fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law.  In the aftermath of 9/11, reports began to surface that terrorism suspects were being sent for interrogation by the United States to countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Morocco, where torture is systematic. Slowly, information also emerged concerning the American use of secret ""black sites"" to hold suspected al-Qaeda leaders and their allies.  While never denying that these practices were being used, U.S. government officials repeatedly offered a single justification for departing from both human rights protections and prisoner of war rules when apprehending such individuals: the United States was involved in a new, unprecedented type of war.  The case of Khaled El-Masri brings these issues before a U.S court.  In an apparent case of mistaken identity, a German man of Lebanese descent was abducted while on vacation in Macedonia, transferred to a secret U.S.-controlled prison in Afghanistan, and subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment over the course of five months. Released when then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice discovered that he was being held by mistake, a stunned El-Masri made his way back to Germany. In December 2005, the ACLU filed suit on his behalf, alleging violations of due process under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and human rights claims based on numerous human rights and humanitarian law treaties which are cognizable under the Alien Tort Statute.  This Chapter, which appears in Human Rights Advocacy Stories, tells the story of the El Masri case from its inception to dismissal, and from U.S. court to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights."
"December 08, 2008","Reawakened from its decades-long slumber during the Cold War, the UN Security Council has become more active than ever before. Increased UN activity, however, has not always spelled increased accountability. The problem is particularly acute with regard to the UN Security Council's anti-terrorism Resolutions that impose economic sanctions on named individuals who are suspected of sponsoring the Taliban or Al Qaeda. These targeted sanctions, or the process by which they are determined, are in severe tension with international and domestic conceptions of fundamental rights."
"December 08, 2008","Truth commissions have become key mechanisms in transitional justice schemes in post conflict societies in order to assure transitions to peace, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. However, few studies examine what must happen to ensure that the transition process initiated by a truth commission successfully continues after the commission concludes its truth-gathering work and submits its final report.  This article argues that while attention often focuses on prosecutions and institutional reforms, reparations also play a critical role.  The authors share their observations of how government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), civil society sectors and victim-survivor's associations struggle over reparations in post truth commission Peru, offering a preliminary analysis of key theoretical suppositions about transitional justice:  they explore whether the act of telling the truth to an official body is something that helps or hinders a victim-survivor in his or her own recovery process, and whether in giving testimonies victim-survivors place particular demands upon the state.  The authors conclude that while testimony giving may possibly have temporary cathartic effects, it must be followed by concrete actions.  Truth tellers make an implicit contract with their interlocutors to respond through acknowledgement and redress."
"December 07, 2008","Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Greek Orthodox, Buddhist, and Chinese traditions regarding just war are compared, a matter of some importance in a time of numerous intercultural clashes and the claims by some that civilians are legitimate targets of terror attacks. There are variations within each tradition, but in general each has parallels to legitimate authority, just cause, right intention, right conduct, treatment of civilians, and the manner in which wars should be resolved."
"December 07, 2008","In the Dueling Experts Game, adversarial experts strategically produce ""good"" or ""bad"" evidence to support their partisan testimony.  Good evidence is probative while bad evidence has no evidential value.  The new feature of this Game is that Judge sometimes erroneously identifies good evidence as bad evidence and vice versa.  Along the Game's equilibrium path, each partisan expert produces only good evidence if it supports his side.  When favorable good evidence is unavailable, an expert produces bad evidence to support his testimony.  Hence, dueling experts always contradict one another.  Despite their conflicting testimony, one of the experts invariably produces the available good evidence for Judge.  Therefore, Judge always receives the available good evidence.  A central result is that the quality of experts, including their ability to persuade judges using available good evidence, and the quality of judges - their ability to distinguish good from bad evidence - determine the accuracy of verdicts.  Remarkably, the likelihood that experts are endowed with good evidence does not matter provided that this likelihood is not identically zero or one."
"December 07, 2008","In recent years, Western democracies have attempted to outlaw political parties alleged to be 'non-democratic'. Provisions in post-World War II constitutions were mainly enacted to exclude Nazi and Fascist parties from participating in the elections. Lately, the banning of political parties has spread to radical and religious parties. Recent debates in Spain, Germany, Turkey and Israel provide some examples of this. This article deals with the legal framework for the disqualification of political parties in Israel, focusing on the new anti-terrorist amendment, which allows for banning lists and individual candidates who support terrorist acts and the use of violence. The new grounds for banning parties are also discussed in a comparative perspective, vis-a-vis the new Spanish law of 2002. The article reveals the dilemmas of Israel, a 'defensive' democracy, in its attempt to deal with support for terrorism by outlawing political parties."
"December 03, 2008","The American government's response to terrorist threats has had three features: a reluctance to restrict the civil liberties of American citizens; an unwillingness to invest heavily, or exercise regulatory authority, to ensure domestic security; and a preference for a militarized response to perceived threats, evidenced in US campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Four features of the American political system explain this response: the increased complexity of the policy network interested in civil liberties; the persistence of populist anti-statism; the militarization of the American polity; and the susceptibility of the American political system to corporate influence. The consequence is a policy response that fails to take adequate measures to assure domestic security. This recent experience in responding to terror threats also suggests larger lessons about the political system's capacity to respond to policy shocks."
"December 03, 2008","The presence of economic motives and commercial agendas in wars is not so much a new phenomenon as a familiar theme in the history of warfare. In recent times, as the contributors to this volume show, the licensing of economically motivated violence in such places as Sierra Leone and Liberia has resembled, in terms of its functional utility, both medieval and early modern patterns of warfare. However, in the recent literature on conflict and, even more so, in the practice of international and nongovernmental organizations, comparatively little systematic attention has been given to the precise role of economically motivated actions and processes in generating and sustaining contemporary civil conflicts. This volume is intended to improve our understanding in this area."
"December 03, 2008","This article begins by discussing various classifications of individuals under international humanitarian law, such as combatants, civilians, and mercenaries, in an attempt to determine which classification is appropriate for non-state actors involved in the ""war on terror.""  Part II of this article details the classification of members of Al-Qaeda under international humanitarian law.  The classification of certain individuals as ""enemy combatants"" is evidence of the limitations of the traditional law of war paradigm.  The United States has relied on the ambiguous rights and responsibilities of non-states actors under international humanitarian law to argue that ""enemy combatants"" do not fall within the scope of the Geneva Conventions.  Part III of this article analyzes the classification of employees of PMCs under international humanitarian law and concludes that employees of PMCs are non-state actors engaged in armed combat.  Part IV of this article details methods of holding employees of PMCs accountable under U.S. law for human rights violations and Part V analyzes the difficulties in ensuring liability.  Although laws exist in the United States to prosecute employees of PMCs, the United States has failed to prosecute any of these individuals, implying that the government is contracting legal services to shield its own illegal actions."
"December 02, 2008","Prevention of conflict is the first promise in the Charter of the United Nations. Yet it is a promise that is constantly betrayed by local parties, governments, international organizations, and to some extent the scholarly community, which until quite recently had been unable to generate policy-relevant analysis of the circumstances in which this goal might be achieved. This edited volume brings together scholarly perspectives and findings that shed practical light on the challenge of moving from reaction to conflict prevention within the UN system."
"December 02, 2008","In the last eight years the Chr¿tien government has taken several steps that have weakened the Access to Information Act, the federal law that guarantees the rights of citizens to access information held by the government. These changes compel a reconsideration of the Act's enforcement strategy - a strategy that is common to many older right-to-information laws - which is centered principally on the resolution of complaints about individual cases of non-compliance and gives the final authority to resolve complaints to the Federal Court of Canada rather than the Information Commissioner.  The author argues that a better strategy would put greater emphasis on the analysis and publication of data on overall compliance patterns; give the Commissioner more effective tools for remedying systemic non-compliance; and give the Commissioner the authority to issue orders to resolve complaints about specific cases of non-compliance. These steps would help to repair frayed relationships between the Office of the Information Commissioner and federal departments, and would improve overall compliance with the requirements of the Act."
"December 02, 2008","Many policymakers suggest that an effective response to terrorist threats will require more extensive sharing of information among government agencies.  Traditionally, governments have insisted on applying the rule of originator control -- ORCON -- before they share information with other governments.  The ORCON rule allows originating governments to retain control over the declassification of information (if it is classified) or its release to non-governmental parties.  The ORCON rule is being widely applied as the U.S. government responds to the terror attacks of September 11.  However, the ORCON rule clashes with the principles underlying most right-to-information laws, and its extension could undermine governmental accountability.  A better approach would allow for the structured decentralization of discretion about the public disclosure of shared information."
"December 01, 2008","The unique Nash equilibrium of the finitely repeated n-person Prisoners' Dilemma calls for defection in all rounds. One way to enforce cooperation in groups is ostracism: players who defect are expelled. If the group's members prefer not to diminish its size, ostracism hurts the legitimate members of the group as well as the outcast, putting the credibility of the threat in doubt. Nonetheless, we show that ostracism can be effective in promoting cooperation with either finite or infinite rounds of play. The model can be applied to games other than the Prisoners' Dilemma, and ostracism can enforce inefficient as well as efficient outcomes."
"December 01, 2008","The foreign policy of Costa Rica has always been characterized by its emphasis on pacifism and human rights. As one of the few nation states lacking an army, it has carefully constructed an image of peace and democracy in a region historically plagued by political turmoil. This small Central American nation has taken advantage of the soft power created by taking a high moral ground on issues of international relations. The present paper undertakes a critical discursive analysis of the second Arias administration. By focusing on the presidency of the former Nobel Peace Prize winner, it is possible to analyze the press releases, speeches, and other government statements released during an exemplary period of Costa Rican diplomatic history. The transfer of recognition from Taipei to Beijing provides a brief glimpse at the neo-realist strategy being pursued by the Arias administration behind the veil of innocence provided by the co-optation of human rights, human security, pacifist, and cosmopolitan discourses. Moreover, the strategic importance of the government's human rights rhetoric is revealed through a detailed analysis of the process leading up to and directly following the recognition of Beijing through the application of a constructivist model of norm socialization, the Parallel Cycles Model of Norm Socialization. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possible application of the two-pronged method of critical discourse analysis combined with a constructivist interpretation of norm socialization to the foreign policy of other Latin American countries and its possible contribution to an improved understanding of the internal dynamics of this region."
"December 01, 2008","This paper deconstructs the conflict leading up to and shortly following the democratic transition in South Africa. A simple instrument is used in order to identify the main components of the conflict. The information gathered by the instrument is then analyzed using three different theories: regime transition theory, norm socialization using the Spiral Model of Socialization developed by Risse and Sikkink (Kollman, 2008, p. 400), and finally a short comparison to John Duckitt and Thobi Mphuthing's attitudinal study of pre- and post-electoral South Africa will be provided (Mphuthing & Duckitt, 1998). The explanations given by the three approaches are then compared and contrasted in order to gain a more holistic understanding of the South African transition."
"December 01, 2008","The premise of this paper is the study in the field of conflict and conflict resolution and that conflict and conflict resolution are useful areas of focus in order to better understand human behavior. Additionally, I will present data that will highlight the notion that conflict is not in itself a bad thing and that conflict has the capability to be utilized as a vehicle for understanding the many contradictions that are necessarily present in our efforts to be social beings."
"November 30, 2008","Despite the great success of WTO dispute settlement, a close examination of current WTO remedies has been continued to point out a variety of potential shortcomings such as ineffective compliance, inadequate remedies and inequitable consequences of retaliation. Among various proposals, monetary or financial compensation has been one of the controversial ideas to address those existing problems. Although monetary compensation has not been ruled out under Article 22.1 of the DSU, this article tries to argue that mandatory, instead of voluntary, monetary compensation could possibly be one of the ways to address the issue of non-compliance and to provide a tentative contour for incorporating mandatory compensation into current system of WTO remedies. Part II will briefly survey the problems with current rules of WTO remedies based on the findings of several arbitrational cases under Article 22.6 of the DSU and the US-Copyright case, the first dispute temporarily solved by arranging monetary compensation between the U.S. and EC under Article 22 of the DSU. Part III specifies the common concerns that may go against the idea of monetary compensation in the WTO. Part IV illustrates how monetary compensation could operate as an alternative to current remedies in the WTO dispute settlement through the examination of the purposes and key components of monetary compensation and its relationship with trade compensation and retaliation. Part V is the concluding remark."
"November 29, 2008","A primary goal of terrorism is to instill a sense of fear and vulnerability in a population and to erode its confidence in government and law enforcement agencies to protect citizens against future attacks. In recognition of its importance, the Department of Homeland Security includes public confidence as one of the principal metrics used to assess the consequences of terrorist attacks. Hence, a detailed understanding of the variations in public confidence among individuals, terrorist event types, and as a function of time is critical to developing this metric. In this exploratory study, a questionnaire was designed, tested, and administered to small groups of individuals to measure public confidence in the ability of federal, state, and local governments and their public safety agencies to prevent acts of terrorism. Data was collected from three groups before and after they watched mock television news broadcasts portraying a smallpox attack, a series of suicide bomber attacks, a refinery explosion attack, and cyber intrusions on financial institutions, resulting in identity theft. Our findings are: (a) although the aggregate confidence level is low, there are optimists and pessimists; (b) the subjects are discriminating in interpreting the nature of a terrorist attack, the time horizon, and its impact; (c) confidence recovery after a terrorist event has an incubation period; and (d) the patterns of recovery of confidence of the optimists and the pessimists are different. These findings can affect the strategy and policies to manage public confidence after a terrorist event."
"November 28, 2008","The paper describes and analyses the role of civil society in five conflict cases - Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Western Sahara and Israel/Palestine. It evaluates the relative effectiveness of civil society organisations (CSOs) and assesses the potential and limits of CSO involvement in conflicts. In particular it concentrates on civil society activities in the fields of peace training and education, including formal and non-formal education, as well as research and media work. The research also identifies the obstacles that local third sector is faced with, examining experiences and lessons learned. The study then presents critical assessments of local CSO contributions to conflict transformation and concludes with a set of suggestions for local and mid-level civil society actors involved in these five conflict cases and beyond. This paper is an overview study, to provide ideas and documentation to the more detailed empirical research carried out in the context of the MICROCON Work Package 'Conflict in the European Neighbourhood'."
"November 26, 2008","This article studies the impact of economic sanctions on the duration and outcome of intrastate conflicts. Sanctions are argued to foster the convergence of beliefs over parties' capacity, to reduce the utility of victory and to increase the costs of continuing fighting. Using a sample of 87 wars and new data on sanctions and sanction types, I show that sanctions and their duration are statistically associated with shorter intrastate conflicts. It is also shown that total economic embargoes are the most effectual type of coercive measure in these cases and that sanctions either imposed by international organizations or other actors have similar negative effects on war duration. In the second part of the article, we disaggregate the dependent variable and demonstrate that sanctions imposed by international institutions increase the likelihood of conflict resolution, whereas those sanctions not imposed by such institutions tend to increase the probability of a military victory. Besides, if the targeted state is a member of the international institution imposing sanctions, the effect of such coercion is even greater. Economic embargos are also proven to increase the likelihood of a military as well as a negotiated end, whereas international arms embargos reduce the likelihood of a military victory."
"November 26, 2008","In the aftermath of the 2008 election, change is in the air with respect to counterterrorism law and policy. The Obama administration almost certainly will terminate the military commission system, and it likely will take steps at least to reduce reliance on the underlying practice of long-term military detention.  Against this backdrop, the debate regarding how best to reform detention policy has sharpened.  Some contend that federal criminal prosecution should supply whatever long-term detention capacity may be required, while others contend that it would be better to design a detention system (such as a national security court) specifically tailored to the problem of terrorism prevention."
"November 25, 2008","The present analysis introduces the N-Effect - the discovery that increasing the number of competitors (N) can decrease competitive motivation. Studies 1a-b found evidence that average test scores (e.g., SAT scores) fall as the average number of test-takers at test-taking venues increases. Study 2 found that individuals trying to finish an easy quiz among the top 20 percent in terms of speed finished significantly faster if they believed they were competing in a pool of 10 versus 100 other people. Using a social comparison orientation (SCO) scale, Study 3 showed the N-Effect occurs strongly among those high in SCO and weakly among those low in SCO. Study 4 directly linked the N-Effect to social comparison, ruling out the ""ratio-bias"" and finding that social comparison becomes less important as N increases. Finally, Study 5 found the N-Effect is mediated by social comparison. Limitations, future directions, and implications are discussed."
"November 24, 2008","Before World War I, most foreign investment in Latin America came from Britain.  By World War II, however, the United States had become the main and unchallenged foreign investor in the region.  This analysis of the negotiations that took place between the British firm (Pearson and Son) and the Colombian government over oil contracts reveals the reasons for the shift in influence. The company's lack of awareness that Britain had been overtaken by the United States as the hegemonic power in the hemisphere eventually caused the negotiations to collapse.  While talks were proceeding, the company failed to consider how much influence the United States had on Colombian internal politics, and it overlooked the history of U.S.-Colombia relations. As a result, Pearson never received oil concessions in Colombia; instead, they were granted to American companies, consolidating U.S. power in the region."
"November 23, 2008","September 11 will long be associated with unthinkable violence. The sheer magnitude of the terrorist attacks, the visual imagery of the collapsing towers of the World Trade Center, and the extensive media attention given to the victims have defined the violence of September 11 in unitary terms. But in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, another form of violence spread across the country: in the days and weeks after September 11, over one thousand bias incidents against Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians were reported. These incidents, including the murders of as many as *1262 nineteen people, assaults of scores of others, vandalism of homes, businesses and places of worship, and verbal harassment of countless individuals, form part of the subterranean history of September 11. While the violence of September 11 itself is largely thought to have been incomprehensible, post-September 11 hate violence is remarkable precisely because it is something we can understand. Although condemned as individual acts of criminality, the phenomenon of hate violence toward Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians is one that appeared to need little explanation; it was accepted as a regrettable, but expected, response to the terrorist attacks. As early as September 12, 2001, major newspapers reported predictions of the violence against these communities."
"November 23, 2008","The Iraqi Special Tribunal (""IST"") failed to heal the wounds in Iraq resulting from years of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime.  Based on examples from the ad hoc international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the semi-internationalized tribunals in Kosovo, East Timor, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone, the IST had strong potential to achieve reconciliation in Iraq.  Nevertheless, the IST did not fulfill this potential and contributed the following prong to the accountability versus accommodation debate: if accountability is chosen by a regime to deal with previous perpetrators of human right abuse, then this choice will only further peace if the trials are perceived as fair and legitimate.  This article concludes that Iraq can stand to learn from other examples of transitional justice, including combining trials with truth and reconciliation commissions.  In addressing future post-conflict situations, the balance between country ownership and compliance with international judicial standards can best be achieved through the use of the International Criminal Court."
"November 23, 2008","A questionnaire measuring cognitive and affective representations of terror risk was developed and tested in Turkey and Israel. Participants in the study were university students from the two countries (n = 351). Four equivalent factors explained terror risk cognitions in each sample: costs, vulnerability, trust, and control.Asingle negative emotionality factor explained the affective component of terror risk representations in both samples. All factors except control could be measured reliably. Results supported the validity of the questionnaire by showing expected associations between cognitions and emotions, as well as indicating gender differences and  cultural variations. Current findings are discussed in relation to previous results, theoretical approaches, and practical implications."
"November 23, 2008","The time has come to extend the national approach that has been used successfully to dismantle the infrastructure of hate groups to the international realm against terrorist groups.  The foundation of this approach is a private right to a cause of action apart from any military or diplomatic efforts by the government.  This article analyzes case precedents under several federal statutes - the Antiterrorism Act of 1991, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Torture Victim Protection Act, the Alien Tort Claim Act - as well as state common law tort claims, including aiding and abetting liability.  Professor Strauss proposes an aggregate model for lawsuits by victims against terrorist groups, organizations, and state-sponsors of international terrorism, combining these claims and the types of damages and defendants accessible under each.  Lastly, this article explores the obstacles to and avenues for enforcement of these judgments through the rule of international law and access to the frozen assets of terrorist states and organizations, providing important tools for plaintiffs in the civil battle against terrorism."

"November 21, 2008","This chapter analyses the positive and theoretical aspects of the doctrine of constitutional law put forward by President Bush II since the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001. First, I claim that Bush II's doctrine of constitutional law can be identified by reference to the four major amendments to the positive constitutional law of the United States that Bush II's attorneys have relied upon when assessing the constitutionality of key policy proposals in the so-called war on terror. In particular, the President has acted as if he had the power to (1) order the indefinite arrest of enemy combatants; (2) define at will the scope of the right to privacy of enemy combatants; (3) order the assassination of enemy combatants; (4) order the torture of enemy combatants. Second, I sustain that all four amendments are to be constructed as the intentional and rather consistent application of Bush II's underlying theory of constitutional law, and not as the evolutionary outcome of constitutional practice in the unbrave new world in which we would have plunged after the terrorist attacks of 2001. This theory is grounded on the claim that the US constitution is in reality composed of two set of norms, one applicable to ordinary citizens and circumstances, the other to enemies and emergency or exceptional circumstances. Third, both changes in positive constitutional law and in constitutional theory are underpinned by a specific conception of what law is and what it should be. Bush II's lawyers have adhered to an eclectic and formally minimalistic theory, which affirms that the substantive content of all laws results from a concrete substantive will, and consequently, that there is no structural relationship between law and public reason. Fourth, it seems to me that there are very good reasons to take very seriously the (massive) consequences of Bush II's constitutional practice and theory, but that should not entail taking seriously his legal and political theories. There are very good reasons to conclude that such theories had always been seen as part and parcel of the propaganda effort to transform constitutional practice, before and after the terrorist attacks of 2001."
"November 21, 2008","The major aim of this paper is to explore the US-led anti-terror war in Somalia and to evaluate its impact on the status and role of Somali women. When al-Qaeda attacked the US embassies in Nairobi (Kenya) and in Dar es Salam (Tanzania) in August 1998, Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism became a major threat to the region. In response to this threat the United States started anti-terror war in East Africa particularly in Somalia. In both the civil war and the anti-terror war in Somalia, Somali women's participation is significant. So far, however, no sufficient study was conducted on the role of women in armed conflicts, and their impacts on women in Somalia, a country that has been already plagued by famine, political instability, ethnic war, and gender-based violence."
"November 20, 2008","The present age has been a witness to a massive amalgamation of cultures, traditions and identities. The spread of people from one area to another has been the trend of the age in search of greener pastures that might provide them with better opportunities in life. The movement also has been prevalent due to the nature of job one is involved with. Human security is not a defensive concept - the way territorial or military security is. It is an integrative concept acknowledging the universal desire of people for self-preservation and self-improvement. The world will not be secure from war and violence if men and women have no security of their individual self. It is the people's security which has come to the forefront over and above the emphasis on territorial and national security. It is being felt that increased safeguards and preventive measures should be in place both at national and global levels to protect the people from the real threat to human security."
"November 20, 2008","Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon and has been playing an important role in the world from the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. But the terrorism, as we see it today, has developed itself from the sixties and is the child of the war created by the imperialist powers. Terrorism stands out to be a method of combat in which random or symbolic victims serve as instrumental targets of violence. Narco-terrorism could be defined as the 'use of organized terror to secure control over a state by another state or organised criminal networks/or by insurgents or by a combination of any or all of them to achieve fixed political, economic or social objectives based on organizational and financial empowerment through drug trafficking.'"

"November 19, 2008","Conflict is an extremely complicated, multi-faceted phenomenon which has occurred throughout history, and will likely continue as long as mankind exists. There are a wide variety of factors underlying conflicts and, therefore, no one-size-fits-all panacea can be found for post-conflict peacebuilding. This article has provided a broad overview of various approaches to peacebuilding following a conflict, and building a culture of peace to mitigate and prevent violent conflict in the future."
"November 19, 2008","There was nothing surprising about the French urban riots of November 2005. In a way, on a smaller scale, urban riots have been a typical occurrence in the banlieues since the eighties. Irrespective of the exact reasons that caused the riots, it has been widely been claimed - especially in the English-speaking media - that the riots represent the failure of the French republican model of integration. We believe this diagnosis to be wrong. Our view is that, on the contrary, these riots should be interpreted as the manifest evidence that most of the frustrated young men feel entirely French and that they simply want to be accepted by the Nation, and more prosaically, and to be part of a modern consumerist society. Their frustration and anger is comprehensible when faced with the unfulfilled promise of socio-economic integration. In other words, the urban riots of November 2005 paradoxically reveal on the one hand the success of the French republican model when it comes to teaching shared values and history, but on the other hand the failure of both the State, which has failed to translate into public policies the values it officially preaches, and the politico-administrative elites who are always keen to stress the benefits of ""republican"" principles while delivering little when it comes to opening up access to key positions of power."
"November 19, 2008","Democracy works fine if everyone agrees on the rule of engagement.

"November 19, 2008","The Orange Revolution in the fall of 2004 built great hopes for a better future for Ukraine. However, three years later those hopes have been replaced by disappointment, frustration and confusion. Although progress in the areas of political freedom, pluralism, civil rights and freedom in the media remains unquestionable the record of economic, institutional and legal reforms is much more problematic. The key macroeconomic indicators are not better than they were few years ago and the business climate has barely improved. The WTO accession process remains incomplete. The perspectives of Euro-Atlantic ntegration are continually subject to heated domestic political controversies. The political situation remains unstable, mostly due to the hasty constitutional changes that were adopted during the Orange Revolution."

"November 18, 2008","At the end of July 2008, the media reported that 4,600  service members have died in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.  But reporting only military fatalities understates the human cost of America's engagements in these regions by nearly a fourth. On the modern, outsourced battlefield, the U.S. government increasingly has delegated to the private sector the responsibility to stand in harm's way and, if required, die for America.  As of 30 June 2008, more than 1,350 civilian contractor personnel had died in Iraq and Afghanistan, while another 29,000 contractors have been injured; more than 8,300 seriously.  Nonetheless, contractor fatalities (and injuries) remain generally outside the public's consciousness.   This article asserts that, in a representative democracy, public awareness of the human cost of our nation's security and foreign policies is critical."
"November 17, 2008","This article takes a comparative, empirical look at the practice of Irish neutrality during the World War II. It critiques a model of neutrality presented in a thesis on Irish neutrality called Unneutral Ireland, consisting of factors derived from an analysis of three states regarded as well-established European neutrals, Austria, Sweden and Switzerland that reflect the practice of neutrality. That model focused on the rights and duties of neutrality; the recognition of Ireland's status by belligerents and others; the disavowal of external help; and the freedom of decision and action. This present article focuses on the factors flowing from these latter obligations that are cited in an analysis of the practice of Irish neutrality, in the Unneutral thesis as proof of Ireland's 'unneutral' status, i.e. ideology; involvement in economic sanctions; partiality; the practice of Irish citizens joining the British army; and post-World War II factors such as Ireland's EEC membership.  In this article, Ireland's practice of neutrality is evaluated against the practice of other European neutral states - Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Finland (including Norway's truncated practice of neutrality) - vis-a-vis the above variables. This article also deals with the perennial myths that crop up in 'unneutral' discourses on Irish neutrality, for example, the oft-cited incidence of de Valera's alleged visit to the German legation in Ireland to sign a book of condolences on Hitler's death and the suggestions of a British government offer of a deal on Northern Ireland in exchange for Ireland dropping its neutral stance and supporting the Allies in World War II. The article concludes that the practice of Irish neutrality is equivalent to or superior to the practice of other European neutral states, thus undermining the dominant discourse that Ireland's neutrality is a myth and that Ireland is 'unneutral'."

I argue that the addition of a consensus building mechanism into the legislative process will create the necessary forums for stakeholders to contribute to the framing and resolution of issues of public concern.  Furthermore, as Susskind has argued, allowing citizens to participate at the beginning of decision-making processes will make legislative outcomes more legitimate and decrease the level of political dissatisfaction."
"November 15, 2008","Is international human rights law being challenged by national law? Are common standards and principles set out in international human rights instruments being denied by national legal systems and less likely respected within national jurisdictions? Have the individuals' civil liberties and fundamental rights been deprived and arbitrarily violated in the name of the protection of 'public interests' and national security? International human rights law allows suspending of and derogating from some human rights in times of public emergency which are clearly stated by national laws. State parties to international human rights conventions sometimes, however, use their rights to suspension of and derogation from their binding obligations in order to breach the individuals' civil liberties and fundamental rights."

"November 13, 2008","This essay, intended as a chapter in a book on ethical issues in global philanthropy, analyzes the problematic relationship between the United Nations and global civil society.  Offering a brief history of the ideological transformation of international NGOs into 'global civil society', it critiques the idea of global civil society as representing the world's peoples to international organizations.  It notes, however, that the idea of global civil society is considered somewhat passe today as a vehicle of legitimacy for global governance - likewise, for that matter, the UN, also somewhat passe in leading intellectual circles as the chosen vehicle for the platonic ideal of global governance.  Leading intellectuals of global governance today lean instead toward such ideas as global government networks and other forms of governance that look to technocratic expertise in particular, indeed narrow, areas as their source of (deliberately limited) legitimacy, rather than seeking broad-based political legitimacy for governance.  The debate over the legitimacy of the UN via legitimation from global civil society, while of great importance, perhaps, to the UN and to global civil society, appears in important respects to have been by-passed by theorists of the technocracy that has no more 'global' ambition than to ensure that the internet arrives on time.  (The essay proceeds through stylized, highly notional time periods as a means to offer a convenient way of characterizing different phases of conceptualization of global governance, global civil society, the UN, and legitimacy.)"
"November 13, 2008","Prostitution has many meanings. It's most obvious meaning is in the context of selling sexual relations for monetary or other gain. However, it is not only in this way that people can be prostituted and, certainly, it is possible to prostitute things other than people. Many nations and societies have outlawed the act of prostitution in its transactional sense. Prostitution of commonly held human values has also been theoretically outlawed within the international community, with torture, genocide, and discrimination against women and girls being only a few areas of international legal focus. In order to stop the prostitution of peoples and the peace by forces of violence and oppression, the United Nations (UN) created peacekeeping operations to assist the local populations affected by such conflicts and to implement political measures which are intended to restore calm. However, in the process of its peacekeeping missions, the UN has itself given rise to the prostitution of the idea of peace it seeks to foster. This prostituting of peace has happened for over a decade and has, until recently, gone largely unnoticed or accepted by the international community generally and legal scholars in particular. And yet, despite public outcry from the UN and the public generally and reform proposals commissioned by the UN itself, this prostitution of peace continues to happen unabated by law. To date, the focus of law in regards to this problem has been to emphasize that the UN cannot itself try peacekeepers for sexual or other misconduct and to commend the UN for remanding errant peacekeepers to their sending states, which exercise jurisdiction over them. What has gone unexamined are the legal and socio-legal structures of sending states whose peacekeepers commit sexual and other crimes abroad while deployed to a UN peacekeeping mission. This article aims to serve as an in-depth study of the penal and, to the extent available to the public, military laws of sending states which have had allegations of sexual and other misconduct made against their peacekeepers, as well as the socio-legal structures of these states which inform law and society in regards to sexual and other crimes. The goal of this article is to demonstrate that there is indeed a link between the laws and socio-legal structure of these sending states and the illegal and immoral acts committed by their peacekeepers. The caveat to the study conducted by this article is that it discusses sending states with reported and publicly divulged allegations made against their peacekeepers. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that there are other sending states affected by the phenomenon of errant peacekeepers yet who, due to reluctant victims and the UN's method of reporting allegations, have not been made public."
"November 12, 2008","This article will argue that ""failed states"" should not pass into international law because to do so will cause more harm than good to the larger international policy goals of human dignity, in regards to authority functions of both prescription and application.  The concerns regarding problems in selected states that the term ""failed states"" tries to address are generally new versions of the perennial dilemma of a state-centric international legal system: how to develop, without interfering with sovereignty or human dignity, adequate means to protect the rights of individuals and diverse groups within states whose politics, economic resources, government leaders, and institutions may be inadequate in this regard."
"November 12, 2008","Most journalists look at their work and see professional pride, not personal prejudice. Even many of those who do the biased bidding of their employers could be characterized as decent, fair-minded, hard-working.  In the Middle East today, however, where the conflict is still largely a war of words, reporters may often miss the forest for the trees.  While such a result could be caused by the inherent limitations of their craft - constant deadlines, sometimes severe space restrictions, the pressure to produce dramatic stories  - when their inherent political bias are combined with ignorance of broad historical perspectives, the result is often a world-view slanted in favor of totalitarian regimes."
"November 12, 2008","In the well-known Biblical story, the faithful, attempting to create a place of unity for themselves, set about building the Tower of Babel, only to see the Tower implode due to linguistic differences and power assertions. Thousands of years later, the world is still plagued by sectarian strife and warfare. Indeed, the situation has only become more involved since Babel, as there are now inter-communal and intra-communal conflicts for supremacy and superiority - a notable difference in these conflicts is that the ultimate tool of getting to Heaven is no longer a tower, it is now a state. Within the framework of the much-vaunted and highly-contested state structure which sits at the heart of inter-communal and intra-communal conflicts lies a duality of politics and law. A state cannot exist without political actors, whatever their motivations may be, and political actors of all belief systems have embraced the need for laws as a method of control - if not equality and a means of assuring an open society."
"November 12, 2008","A considerable body of international norms, institutions and procedures specifically designed to deal with terrorism has emerged over the last few years. This body of international law increasingly bears the characteristics of a ""special regime"". At the same time, legal scholars have started to treat terrorism as a ""branch"" of international law in its own right, both in terms of research and teaching. This article argues that the emergence of a distinct category of ""terrorism law"" is due to reasons that are very different from those that account for the general trend towards the fragmentation and compartmentalization of international law. It is primarily the result of political pressure by certain powerful states to establish, at the international level, a separate legal system for terrorism that mirrors their own domestic special regimes, so as to give expression to the ""international community's"" sense of outrage at terrorist acts, stigmatize the perpetrators, and reassure the public. As these objectives can only be achieved if those who fall under the anti-terrorism regime are singled out for particularly harsh treatment, the special treatment model inevitably undermines the fundamental principle that all human beings deserve equal protection of the law."
"November 11, 2008","The French Presidency has more or less dropped its initial agenda and has turned nearly exclusively to crisis management, forced by the need to address the three major crises the EU stumbled into in the course of the second half of 2008: the institutional crisis after the Irish 'no' on the Treaty of Lisbon, the breakout of the Russian-Georgian war and the subsequent EU relations with Russia and the financial crisis and its potentially recessionary consequences."
"November 10, 2008","Throughout my field work I had numerous encounters with people who had unique knowledge of the inner-workings of dark networks. Beneath the seemingly uncontested political reality in Greece and the Balkans, it is possible to identify conspiratorial forces that could only became visible with ethnographic methods. In this short research note I present an effort to map out the structure and inner-workings of a loosely organised network based in Greece believed to have ties to the wider Al Qaeda structure. The material used for this note derive from official documents and special reports from private archives as well as individual accounts."
"November 10, 2008","Since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the subsequent evaporation of the Communist threat, at the beginning of 1990s, scholars have shifted their attention to the threatening role of non-state criminal actors. The inter-linkages between organised crime, terrorism, corruption and politics have been depicted by the post Cold War security discourse as significant obstacles to democratic processes, security and stability at the national regional and global levels.  Motivated by theoretical considerations, this article provides an overview of the conceptual underpinnings of existing research on the crime-terror nexus and attempts to synthesise existing theories."
"November 09, 2008","The agreement signed by the Irish and British governments and most of the political parties in Northern Ireland on 10th April 1998 (Good Friday) was a truly historic step. The agreement itself marks the most significant shift in party political positions since the partition of Ireland. This, coupled with the fact that the agreement is open-ended, and indeed under its provisions must develop beyond what is already agreed to survive means that an analysis of the evolution of party political attitudes which led to this agreement is essential in order to understand its significance. The following article gives a brief summary of the key provisions of the agreement, analyses the processes which led the different parties towards a position where agreement was possible and examines the referenda which ratified the agreement North and South and election results to the new Northern Ireland Assembly - the public's first opportunities to pass judgement on the efforts of their politicians."
"November 09, 2008","There is still very little constitutional control over the decision to use armed force, and very limited domestic implementation of the international principles of jus ad bellum, notwithstanding the increasing overlap between international and domestic legal systems and the spread of constitutional democracy. The relationship between constitutional and international law constraints on the use of armed force has a long history. Aspects of constitutional theory, liberal theories of international law, and transnational process theory of international law compliance, suggest that constitutional design could legitimately be used as a pre-commitment device to lock-in jus ad bellum principles, and thereby enhance compliance with that regime of international law."
"November 09, 2008","Political actors in Northern Ireland, like those in most conflicts, have drawn international comparisons to their situation with other high profile situations.  While there have been few formal proposals to directly import solutions from other conflicts there have been many attempts to use international comparison to explain the origin and nature of the conflict and to seek to gain sympathy by linking the Northern Ireland conflict to one of which a targeted audience has more knowledge and/ or strong views.  There have also been attempts to promote other policy objectives via association with international events or organisations.  This article seeks to examine the manner in which Irish nationalists have made links with the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  It analyses two separate components of Irish nationalism.  The foreign policy of the Republic of Ireland is analysed not only as the official expression of moderate Irish nationalism but also because it sets a broader ideological context within which even more radical voices are situated.  Secondly it examines how Sinn Fein, as the largest expression of radical Irish nationalism and  the majority party among the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, have sought to utilise comparison with the Palestinian cause in their political discourse over the period of the recent conflict and peace process."
"November 09, 2008","To date, U.S. cross-border operations from Afghanistan into Pakistan have taken three forms: the use of Predator drones to target Al Qaeda fighters (although such drones may be launched solely from within Pakistan); the ""hot pursuit"" of militants who engaged in raids from Pakistan against U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, as well as the Afghan government; and the deployment of special operations forces into Pakistan as a means of striking at Al Qaeda. These types of cross-border operations clearly implicate the jus ad bellum, in that they entail one state projecting highly coercive military force into another state. Arguably Pakistan has consented to at least some of these types of cross-border operations, but that consent is poorly documented, suffers from the conflicting and diffuse sources of authority within the Pakistani government, and ultimately may not endure given the vicissitudes of Pakistani domestic politics. As such, though consent is a powerful and useful basis for supporting the legality of U.S. cross-border operations, other justifications should be considered as well."
"November 09, 2008","During the past decade, even with an increased emphasis on EU integration, the United Nations has retained a central place in Irish foreign policy.   Both political discourse and public opinion polls indicate widespread support for the organisation as a source of international legitimacy and as the appropriate forum to make major decisions regarding peace and security; international human rights; and development.  This support draws from both the idea that the UN provides the most suitable forum and safeguards for a small state in the international system and also from the identification of the ethical basis of Irish foreign policy with the founding principles of the UN.   This paper examines the position of the United Nations in contemporary Irish foreign policy, focusing on 4 key priorities identified in the states only White Paper on foreign policy - peacekeeping; disarmament; human rights; and development."
"November 09, 2008","Since the attacks on the United States of America on September 11th 2001 the US has chosen a strongly unilateral foreign policy underscored and effectively sustained by military power. In the immediate aftermath of the attack on the US it was speculated that American desire to build an international coalition against terrorism and to take military action in sensitive areas would lead it to engage in dialogue with its potential allies in both the developed and developing worlds.  This did not prove to be the case as the US displayed a willingness to act in opposition to the international community and to back up its foreign policy decisions with force if necessary. This article analyses the current international role of the US and the impact US actions have on the emerging system of international governance.  While the US is undoubtedly dominant, and their actions in the international arena have undermined the effectiveness of the United Nations, they have faced unprecedented opposition to their policy on Iraq, have not been able to prevent initiatives such as the International Criminal Court or to win widespread international support, in either the industrialised states or among the developing world for their actions.  This indicates a reduction in US hegemony and also an increase in international insecurity as US foreign policy action aimed at securing a narrowing defined American national interest leads to growing polarisation in the international system."
"November 09, 2008","Traditionally, states and the federal government maintained an ""upstairs, downstairs"" relationship when it came to global affairs, with states serving in the background role as the downstairs members of the national household.  However, the traditional federal-state relationship in the international affairs arena is increasingly unworkable as states become more and more transnationally active.  This is particularly true in the area of human rights implementation, where states have both used their own policies to associate with human rights movements worldwide and have incorporated human rights norms into their own state laws.  Federal courts' approach to human rights implementation, however, has failed to recognize these complexities.  Instead, through American Insurance Ass'n v. Garamendi and Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, the courts have endorsed a regime that generally disfavors human rights implementation on the state level by finding broad federal preemption, even in the absence of any direct conflict between state and federal policy.  At the same time, the recent Supreme Court decision of Medellin v. Texas permits states to eschew human rights norms even in the face of a contrary executive memorandum and Senate ratification.  Examining these contrasting cases in detail, this essay proposes a series of principles to establish greater scope for subnational human rights implementation through a more sensitive and realistic approach to federal preemption doctrine in an age when states are no longer simply a ""downstairs"" presence but are directly engaged in the human rights project."
"November 07, 2008","This paper examines how violence influences the political preferences of an aggrieved constituency that is purportedly represented by militant factions. Using public opinion poll micro data of the Palestinian population linked to data on fatalities from the Second Intifada, we find that although Israeli violence discourages Palestinians from supporting moderate political positions, this ""radicalization"" is fleeting, and vanishes completely within 90 days. We do, however, find evidence suggesting that major political events in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have had a longer-term impact on political preferences. Individuals who were teenagers during the period of the Oslo negotiations tend to have relatively moderate preferences, while those who were teenagers during the First Intifada tend to be relatively radical."
"November 05, 2008","In most negotiation courses, students are taught to consider their alternatives to reaching a negotiated agreement, identify their ""BATNA,"" and determine their ""bottom line."" Yet, many courses fail to provide equal attention to the related but distinct notion of aspirations, that is, negotiator goals that exceed the bottom line. The topic of aspirations is, no doubt, addressed indirectly in negotiation courses that stress the importance of understanding interests and setting priorities, but the critical link between these concepts and setting specific goals is often missing. This brief essay attempts to rectify this omission by discussing the importance of aspirations in bargaining, how negotiators should determine their aspirations, and why negotiators often fail to follow this approach."
"November 05, 2008","The debate surrounding the legal status of Gaza after Israel's disengagement in September 2005 exemplifies some of the chronic limits and deficiencies that international humanitarian law in general and the law of occupation in particular suffer from: (a) binary application - the law operates within clear-cut dichotomies and struggles with recognizing ambiguous situations; (b) varying realities - prevalent tensions between ""legal reality"" and the actual conditions ""on the ground"" cause the characterization of conflicts to be based upon different law-based and fact-based perceptions of reality; (c) inconsistent legal and policy approaches - parties to a conflict attempt to simultaneously advance different legal and political goals, which leads to a state of affairs that encourages the application of IHL in a selective and inconsistent manner; (d) chronic gaps between law as it is and law as it should be - lex lata may bring about unsatisfactory outcomes - hence, parties and commentators often attempt to modify existing laws through radical reinterpretations. Focusing on the recent debate over the status of Gaza, this Article illustrates how these four fundamental tensions hamper the application of the law of occupation in factually complicated situations."
"November 05, 2008","This essay outlines two areas in which ADR and the pedagogy of ADR remain deficient. The first area is counseling. I argue in this essay that without better counseling prior to, during, and after engaging in ADR processes, the promise of ADR has not been met."
"November 05, 2008","One of the most difficult elements in any negotiation is responding effectively to the other side when it has said or done something that makes you uncomfortable.  Sometimes a negotiator will deliberately use comments such as those listed above as a form of gamesmanship. At other times, such comments just display ignorance. Nonetheless, perceived insults, biased comments, or questionable personal statements can and do snarl many negotiations, leaving you wondering about the other side's motives and intentions. How does a good negotiator handle this king of problem? Retaliation? Letting it go? Responding Coolly?"
"November 05, 2008","This Article explores the grounds and consequences of illegal occupation. It proposes that an occupation may be considered illegal if it is involves the violation of a peremptory norm of international law that operates erga omnes, and is related to territorial status. Accordingly, illegal occupations are primarily those achieved through violation of the prohibition on the use of force and of the right to self-determination, or maintained in violation of the right to self-determination. This examination forms the basis for a systematic analysis of specific occupations that have been declared illegal by U.N. organs. The second part of the Article addresses the consequences of an occupation's illegality, in view of the political and legal objectives of determining such illegality. It considers the international responsibility for an illegal occupation; the obligation of non-recognition and the law applicable to an illegal occupation; and the right to self-defense. The Article concludes by commenting on the role of ""illegal occupation"" as a category under international law."
"November 05, 2008","This Paper argues that the traditional international legal discourse on occupation fails to reflect the condition of international relations, and their governability by international law, at the turn of the 21st century. This Paper suggests re-conceptualizing the concept of occupation by linking it to the discourse of failed and fragile states and the responsibility to protect. A contemporaneous understanding of occupation needs to reflect its transforming relationship to sovereignty. Occupation represents a state of interference with the external aspect of sovereignty, which ultimately infringes also on the state of internal sovereignty. In contemporary world politics, occupation arises also from a chain of successive situations interfering with sovereignty wherein internal sovereignty becomes ""vitiated"" (""failed and fragile state""), and creates a condition conducive to interference with external sovereignty. The outcome of this order of impingements on sovereignty represents a state wherein sovereignty was suspended."
"November 05, 2008","This is a preliminary inquiry into the application to occupation law of the distinction between jus in bello (or IHL) and jus ad bellum. Under current doctrine, the two are mutually exclusive: the former applies irrespective of the ""nature or origin of the armed conflict or the causes espoused by the Parties."" I argue that occupation law, although generally considered part of IHL, is intrinsically less susceptible to a strict application of the distinction."
"November 04, 2008","It is generally considered unquestionable that the waging of war must involve at the very least the possibility of killing, wounding, and hurting combatants under certain conditions. This article attempts to explore the continued validity of that assumption in light of the emergence of so-called non-lethal weapons. Drawing on the idea of 'necessity' in international humanitarian law, it begins by highlighting the essential contingentness of a concept of war based on lethality. Adopting constructivist insights to the study of war can allow one to reconceptualize war as a highly socially constructed and regulated activity that defines war as much as it is defined by it. From a theoretical point of view, the only legitimate goal of war, under a properly understood concept of necessity, should be 'incapacitation' rather than the 'destruction' of enemy forces. The article explores what it is that has made 'destruction' necessary in war historically and what might make a more systematic use of non-lethal weapons even between combatants a possibility. It argues that a mixture of technological, military, and political dilemmas have been obstacles to the ability to think of war as a 'meaningful' social activity if it does not involve at least the possibility of killing combatants, but that all these factors are susceptible to change. Furthermore, it argues that whether use of non-lethal technology should be made compulsory is ultimately a normative question, and that there are strong arguments that both the ethics of war and international humanitarian law are ever more intolerant of death, be it of combatants. Ultimately, wars that rely much more on non-lethal technology would be very different from war as we know it. International humanitarian law would have  a key role in bringing about such a change."
"November 03, 2008","In the United States, ADR generally works as an alternative to the judiciary within the framework of the legal system, operating under what has been described as the shadow of the law. However, this assumption does not hold in most Latin American countries. That is, in Latin America, ADR usually is not a true alternative because it operates without a practical judicial option, without an effective shadow of the law. The promotion of ADR in dispute resolution systems that lack functional and effective courts has only exacerbated problems of access to justice by creating three tiers of justice: private arbitration, for those who can afford an arbiter; the justice system, for those who can afford a lawyer; and mediation centers, for those who can afford neither. The present article addresses the need to enhance the shadow of the law in Latin America, which is necessary to optimize effective dispute resolution systems in the region."
"November 03, 2008","A recent article by the economist Samuel Brittan in The Financial Times was entitled ""Make the world safe from crusaders.""  In his article, Mr. Brittan discussed one of the two books that most influenced him as a student.  That book was Christianity, Diplomacy and War, and its author, Sir Herbert Butterfield, was one of the most eminent British historians of the twentieth century.  Brittan noted that it was deeply regrettable that Butterfield's book ""seems to have passed into oblivion...  For there is no better antidote to the fantasies of the American neo-conservatives or the European liberal imperialists.""  Brittan is exactly right.  Butterfield's work on the subjects of diplomacy and war, and the relationships of both to Christianity, deserves to be recollected, pondered and evaluated."
"November 01, 2008","This study examines ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. The major thesis is that politicization of ethnic distinctions by major political parties has fuelled an ethnic violence and conflict in Sri Lanka. The study employs an interactive approach to understand violence of both parties. Each party's violence against the other increases the sense of distrust between them. Political elites then use ethnic emotions in their quest for power, reinforcing ethnic tensions. This paper also discusses some fundamental historical factors that play a role in understanding Sri Lanka's ethnic violence.  It finally suggests solutions to the protracted ethno-political conflict -- partition or power-sharing."
"November 01, 2008","While generally courts seem to have stopped and in many cases reversed the expansion of product liability, cigarette litigation is one of the few areas where there are signs of expanding tort liability.  Cochran looks at the similarities between cigarettes and alcohol in considering whether alcohol manufacturers may be the next target of product liability lawsuits.  The similarities between cigarettes and alcohol are numerous.  Both are hedonic products, or products whose primary purpose is to provide pleasure.  They are also both dangerous to users and bystanders, and society as a whole.  Currently, many of the costs created by hedonic products are borne by society as a whole.  By courts imposing liability on these products, the risk would be distributed, costs internalized, and corrective justice served.  Cochran shows that there is an emerging right of bystanders to recover from manufacturers when injured by a dangerous hedonic product such as tobacco or alcohol.  He argues that manufacturers and consumers of these products should not benefit from the products at the expense of injured bystanders.  Imposing liability would spread the risk of bystander injury to all users of the product."
"November 01, 2008","This article investigates the reach of the United Nations Charter's legal regime created to govern the use of interstate armed force with a view to examining the permissibility of anticipatory self-defence. It examines the pre-Charter law on the use of force; the drafting and language of the Charter; and the international legal cases that address use of force. The article concludes that international law prohibits anticipatory self-defence and thus leaves no doubt that preemptive force is illegal."
"November 01, 2008","This article is about two different narratives or accounts of torture. Each narrative signifies a certain view about the legality and wisdom of employing torture and coercion in interrogation. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the use of torture and coercion has become a topic of genuine debate, despite a sizable corpus of domestic and international law prohibiting those very practices."
"October 31, 2008","The use (and misuse) of law to counter terrorism has proliferated at the national, regional and international levels since the terrorist attacks on the United States of 11 September 2001. Asia is no exception, although the roots of counter-terrorism laws run much deeper than those which grew out of 9/11. What is relatively new in the region after 9/11 is the increase in the scope and range of specific anti-terrorism laws, including those which generically define terrorism for various purposes. Not surprisingly, in the absence of an international definition of terrorism, some national definitions of terrorism in Asia are very wide indeed. As such, this article will examine a number of key counter-terrorism legal initiatives at the regional level in Asia."
"October 31, 2008","This paper first considers the policy reasons for why the international community should define terrorism, focusing on arguments that terrorism: (a) seriously violates human rights; (b) jeopardizes the State, deliberative politics and the constitutional order which sustains rights; (c) is politically or publicly motivated violence distinguishable from private violence; (d) threatens international peace and security; and (e) requires definition to control the operation of mandatory Security Council measures since 2001, which have empowered States to unilaterally define and criminalize terrorism to suit their own sovereign interests. Secondly, this paper briefly outlines recent proposals for an international definition of terrorism before extrapolating the basic elements of an international definition of terrorism from the policy reasons for definition discussed in the first part of this chapter. Finally, claims that certain conduct should be excluded from any definition of terrorism are considered. A coherent legal definition of terrorism might help to confine the misuse of the term by national governments against their political opponents and in ways which seriously undermine fundamental human rights."
"October 31, 2008","This paper focuses on the growing pressure to automatically exclude suspected terrorists from refugee status since the late 1990s including exclusion based on mere membership of terrorist organizations. As the first part of this paper shows, such pressure has emanated from the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, regional organizations, States and even the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Yet, as the remainder of the paper illustrates, terrorism is not listed as a separate ground of exclusion in the 1951 Refugee Convention, and there is no internationally accepted definition of terrorist offences which could serve as a principled basis of exclusion. In the absence of an international definition of terrorism, operative legal reference to terrorism in exclusion decisions endangers refugees and violates international refugee law. This chapter argues foremost that exclusion must be based on an individual assessment of whether a person meets the specific criteria for exclusion in Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Further, the existing exclusion grounds - though misapplied by some States in practice - are adequate and appropriate for addressing the serious challenges posed by modern terrorism."
"October 31, 2008","Controversy has erupted in many jurisdictions about the inclusion of a motive element in the criminal law definition of terrorism, in particular whether reference to a political, religious or ideological purpose or cause unjustifiably interferes in freedom of expression and freedom of religion, or invites racial or religious discrimination. This article argues that a compelling reason for including a motive element in an international or domestic definition of terrorist offences is that it helps to differentiate terrorism from other kinds of serious violence which may also generate fear (such as common assault, armed robbery, rape, or murder), while also according with commonplace public understanding of what constitutes terrorism. As such, the criminal law should recognise this distinction in defining terrorism, so as to more accurately express what is considered by the international and national communities to be distinctively wrongful about terrorism. Inevitably, this view reflects judgments of policy, politics and ethics, which may not be shared by all; but it is the critical impulse underlying arguments for including motive in definitions of terrorism."
"October 31, 2008","This article introduces the ""pseudo-reality"" method of constructing and conducting conflict resolution training workshops.  This method focuses on creating a backdrop against which participants engage in negotiation and mediation skill-building, using real-life events and facts - but only to the extent that these events and facts promote the learning process.  By creating pseudo-reality, trainers can overcome learning-hampering effects resulting from participants' strong preconceptions or bias on a topic, while at the same time preserving the advantages of working within a familiar, realistic environment.  This method is meant to be used when the main goal of a workshop is skill-building rather than imparting substantive knowledge of a conflict.  The method is demonstrated by describing its use at a workshop conducted recently in Cyprus, in which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict served as a backdrop for conflict resolution skill-building.  Finally, the article provides a model designed to help conflict resolution trainers create pseudo-reality in their own workshop frameworks."
"October 30, 2008","There has been considerable ambivalence in the response of the international community and different national governments towards the problem of how to respond to individual terrorist acts and sustained campaigns of terrorist violence. Responses vacillate between a desire to punish and deter terrorists through the strict application of the criminal law, and counter impulses to temper or even suspend the application of the law to mitigate the potential harm from exceptional threats of extreme violence. This paper first outlines how international law has responded to the question of amnesties for serious international crimes, before extracting and elaborating some basic guidelines for their use. It then specifically examines whether terrorist acts raise similar or different considerations in relation to amnesties than other serious international crimes, before focusing on the impacts of terrorism amnesties on international security and justice issues."
"October 30, 2008","This Paper examines some of the benefits and dangers of Taiwan's deepening economic ties to China."
"October 28, 2008","After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1373, obligating all states to enact new laws that criminalized activities related to terrorism. Although the resolution required states to pass laws in different areas of public policy, it made the adoption of laws against terrorism financing a priority. The aim was to undermine terrorist groups' ability to raise funds and to move these monies around the world. In 2006, a UN report explained that the level of conformity with these requirements was mixed in the Middle East; countries bordering the Mediterranean have been less compliant than those in the Persian Gulf. This paper analyzes the reasons that inform the UAE's and Bahrain's decision to comply with these financial standards. Employing research on transnational networks, it explains that multiple forces have shaped these governments' strategies. For instance, while global pressures have been important determinants, regional mechanisms, as seen with the creation of MENAFATF, have also allowed states to discuss different ways to fulfill global standards, but in line with the region's cultural interests and economic and political traditions. At the local level, Bahrain and the UAE are becoming important global financial hubs and their compliance has been used to attract foreign investments. Moreover, both states have strong ties to the United States and conformity with these rules, which are similar to the ones found in the USA PATRIOT Act, shows their commitment to Washington's global war on terror, but without having to publicly support America's strategies."
"October 28, 2008","This Article analyzes the tension between the grassroots, individual perceptions of rights in Sudan and the international donor community's way of promoting human rights. To do so, I use data gathered from over 150 interviews with key legal actors in Sudan and extensive field research in camps for people displaced by that country's 23-year civil war and the ongoing crisis in Darfur."
"October 28, 2008","This paper examines the Larsen v. the Hawaiian Kingdom Case before an arbitral tribunal established under auspice of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague (Netherlands). The case concerns a dispute between an American national resident of Hawaii as Claimant and the ""Hawaiian Kingdom"" as Respondent. At the heart of the dispute lies the question of the legality of the annexation of Hawaii by the United States in 1898 and the claim of the continuing existence of the Kingdom as an independent State in international law. The Arbitral Tribunal did not tackle any of these issues since it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over the dispute submitted by the Parties."
"October 26, 2008","This paper reports on a qualitative study commissioned by the European Union (EU) and intended to help to improve strategic, pan-European security dialogue and partnership between the private and public sectors. The study draws on interviews with security managers at European level and on a reading of relevant EU policy documents. Most consultees argued for a ""trusted forum"", in which security professionals would trade their knowledge and expertise, rather than ""representing"" specific private firms or state agencies. As the study was being conducted, there was a political tilt in ""ownership"" within the European Commission, the public-private security dossier being relinquished by its Directorate General for Justice Freedom and Security (Third Pillar) and being gained by DG Enterprise and Industry (First Pillar). Scanning the policy context, the paper suggests that security cooperation, hitherto conceptualised as public-private (public sector lead), should be understood as private-public, as security serves economic concerns."
"October 24, 2008","This paper proposes a mathematical model for an optimal hostages rescue problem. When more than one person is taken hostage at a given time, a decision as to whether or not to attempt a rescue has to be made. The objective is to minimize the probability of a given number or more hostages being killed where the given number is determined by the decision maker in charge of resolving the crisis. Several properties of the optimal rescue rule are clarified."
"October 24, 2008","Recent debate on Irish foreign policy has often been framed by the presumed influence of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy and the dependence of the Irish economy on Foreign Direct Investment from the US.  More broadly, small states are generally assumed to have little significant influence on world events. Empirical research on these issues is difficult in the Irish context given the often guarded nature of Irish foreign policy pronouncements. Ireland's term on the UN Security Council in 2001 and 2002 offers an opportunity both to examine Irish foreign policy decision-making at the highest international level and to look at the capacity of a small state to have influence. The results of this study suggest that contrary to common perceptions, Irish diplomats on the Council did regularly disagree with the US on foreign-policy decisions and that the influence of EU membership was very limited-primarily because there was often no common European policy on the most controversial issues. Ireland can, however, be seen to have influenced a number of key decisions made by the Council during its most recent term as an elected member."

"October 21, 2008","As societies and economies increasingly rely on electronic telecommunications, they grow more vulnerable to threats from other computer systems. At the same time, states' military and intelligence organizations are increasingly developing the capability to attack and defend these assets. As with the introduction of earlier weapons systems, would-be users express the belief that the laws restraining warjare no longer apply. This Note seeks to explain the emerging relationship between electronic telecommunications and the laws of war. In particular, this Note seeks to show how the norm requiring the discrimination between military and civilian objectives may be retained in an era of long-distance wagare. Finally, it presents a model protocol to guide warriors and lawyers in planning or judging the legitimacy of information operations."
"October 21, 2008","This article explains why individuals support the work of charities that support jihadist operations, even when they may not agree with these organizations' agenda. Employing a behavioral model, we argue that individual Muslims donate monies to Islamist charities that support jihadist causes as a response to social pressures, in an attempt to avoid social seclusion. We divide this chapter into two parts. The first explains why al Qaeda and other jihadist groups use charities to raise most of their funds. Part two introduces our behavioral model. It explains that when publicly facing a charity's demands for funds a Muslim has three options. The first is exit or the person's decision to cut himself from the community in order to avoid the charity's fundraising efforts. The second option is sincere voice or an individual's public expression of dissatisfaction with the charity's demands or its agenda.  The final option is self-subversion, which takes place when a person donates funds to a charity in order to comply with social pressures. After explaining why self-subversion tends to be the dominant response, we conclude this investigation with the model's policy implications in the ongoing global struggle against terrorism."
"October 21, 2008","The image of China's peaceful rise, which the Chinese government is keen to enforce in the world, stands in contrast to the view of China's ascent as a threat. China's economic and military growth is perceived as a potential threat to the (East) Asian security structure and as a challenge to the preponderance of the United States. Even though the PRC is more active in international and regional organizations - and better integrated in the international community - than ever before, the ambiguity of China's true political intentions is still dominant."
"October 21, 2008","This essay explores the ways that the Four Freedoms were intended to address the dire circumstances of the Second World War. It analyzes the historical context of the 1940s in which the Four Freedoms first emerged, how they formed the basis of the International Bill of Human Rights, and how they evolved over the decades that followed. This essay argues that, restored to their proper place at the center of U.S. policy, the Four Freedoms promise a more principled and more effective grand strategy than the ""Global War on Terrorism."" Part I introduces the argument that the Four Freedoms remain both solid law and wise policy. Part II describes the historical origins of the Four Freedoms. Roosevelt proposed them as a package based on his faith in the merits of American civil rights and his experience facing widespread want and fear. Part III examines the ways in which definitions of the Four Freedoms - particularly the Freedom from fear-drifted during the Cold War Era, plucked apart by those seeking to promote one or another freedom, ignoring FDR's original formulation of the Four Freedoms as a package. Part IV further develops the proposition that the Four Freedoms present a compelling paradigm for peace and security today. The essay concludes by returning to the Anglo-American security partnership which forged the Four Freedoms in 1941 and calls for a recommitment to the vision of a peaceful world articulated by FDR and embraced by Winston Churchill, among others. When the Four Freedoms are treated as a package, they offer not only inspiration but also a well-balanced framework for formulating effective policies, addressing such issues as sustainable development, trade, and inequality, as well as dealing with the threats posed by radical jihad."
"October 20, 2008","Crime, violence, and insecurity are among the most important social topics in contemporary Costa Rica. These three issues play a central role in the media, politics, and everyday life, and the impression has emerged that security has changed for the worse and that society is now threatened permanently. However, crime statistics do not support this perception. The paper thus asks why violence and crime generate such huge fear in society. The thesis is that the Costa Rican national identity - with Costa Rica constructed as a nonviolent nation - impedes a realistic discussion about the phenomena and their causes, and simultaneously provides a platform for sensationalism and the social construction of fear."
"October 20, 2008","This Article provides historical and legal support for the contention that the Sudanese government is guilty of genocide in southern Sudan, the Nuba mountains, and the Darfur region.  Specifically, the government and the militias it sponsors have massacred civilians in these regions on a wide scale, starved and enslaved their inhabitants, committed widespread rape, burned hundreds or thousands of villages, and blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the victims in such a way as to ensure that mass deaths resulted.  For these reasons, this Article disagrees with the 2005 report of the the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, submitted to the U.N. Secretary-General in early 2005 at the request of the U.N. Security Council, which concluded that the element of genocidal intent was missing because the government had not exterminated the entire population of Darfur.  This Article applies the Genocide Convention, in light of the precedents established by national and international tribunals that have construed it over the years, to establish that genocide has occurred in Sudan because the Sudanese military and allied militia have killed and wounded many members of identifiable indigenous African groups by means of repeated and large-scale destructive and discriminatory acts.  Genocidal intent may be inferred under such circumstances, as it was after the genocides in German-occupied Europe, the former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda."
"October 20, 2008","The region of the Middle East is highly conflict-loaded. The absence of one distinct regional power may be considered both cause and consequence of this structural feature. At the same time, there are significant power gaps between states in the Middle East, with Israel among the most powerful actors and accordingly defined as a potential regional power. Due to the specific empirical setting of the Middle East region, an analytical design emphasizing relational and procedural dynamics is required. In attempting to develop such a design, this paper utilizes three well-established schools of thought of international relations: (neo)realism, institutionalism, and constructivism. These three schools of thought are further used for developing hypotheses on both Israeli regional policy and its effects on the Middle East. After illustrating these hypotheses in relation to four periods in the contemporary history of Israel, theoretical lessons to be learned for the analysis of regional powers in other world areas are presented."
"October 20, 2008","Have the attacks of September 11, 2001 revolutionized U.S. foreign policy? This article argues that under President George W. Bush's leadership, the United States' foreign policy has abandoned its position of restraint for an expansionist strategy, influenced by imperial ambitions. Using the American experience in the Caribbean in the late nineteen century and early twentieth century, it examines contemporary U.S. foreign policy through the prism of 1898, suggesting that Bush's foreign policy strategy is similar to President William McKinley's strategy. In this manner, the Middle East, especially after the 2003 Iraq war, has become America's ""new Caribbean""."
"October 20, 2008","This research examines theoretically and empirically the economic origins of ethnolinguistic diversity. The empirical analysis constructs detailed data on the distribution of land quality and elevation across contiguous regions, virtual and real countries, and shows that variation in elevation and land quality has contributed significantly to the emergence and persistence of ethnic fractionalization. The empirical and historical evidence support the theoretical analysis, according to which heterogeneous land endowments generated region specific human capital, limiting population mobility and leading to the formation of localized ethnicities and languages. The research contributes to the understanding of the emergence of ethnicities and their spatial distribution and offers a distinction between the natural, geographically driven, versus the artificial, man-made, components of contemporary ethnic diversity."
"October 20, 2008","A review of the literature on post-Cold War peace operations demonstrates that the international community's record in establishing a self-sustaining peace is mixed. In most cases, international agents have not established legitimate political orders or prevented the recurrence of the fighting. Employing Jorgen Habermas's research, this article differentiates between two theoretical approaches to peace operations: strategic and communicative. Although I use the latter to critique the former, it is important to note that my primary aim is not to promote one theoretical approach. Recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, the goal is to explain how theorists and decision-makers should use insights from both approaches to assess existing peace operations and to create new types of operations that may establish self-sustaining political orders. A secondary objective is to introduce the theoretical underpinnings of a society-building strategy, as an intellectual counterweight to state-building efforts, which have dominated post-settlement peace building operations."
"October 19, 2008","In its recent decision of Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme Court invalidated the collective effort of the President and Congress to limit the ability of ""enemy combatants"" held by the United States to challenge the legality of their detention in Article III courts.  While the majority opinion focused primarily on the scope of the constitutional habeas guarantee, it is impossible to ignore the reality that the issue that lay just below the surface was the legitimacy of subjecting individuals to ""generational"" detention based on an expansively applied definition of the term ""enemy combatant.""  Although the Court had four years earlier held that preventive detention based on such a designation was conceptually justified as a ""fundamental and accepted incident of war"", it had also suggested that should the scope of that definition become disconnected from the customary concept of an enemy battlefield belligerent, this justification might erode.  By providing Guantanamo detainees with the long demanded opportunity to obtain judicial review of the legality of their detention, the Court has set in motion a process that will almost inevitably force the government to defend the scope of the enemy combatant definition it has relied on to justify the preventive detention of individuals who do not fall into the traditional realm of a battlefield belligerent.  In so doing, the Court has set in motion a process that will finally bring to a head the legitimacy of applying detention authority derived from the long established customary law of armed conflict in a context context characterized by the hyperbolic designation of a ""Global War.""  Because the government will almost certainly now be forced to demonstrate how the scope of the enemy combatant definition relied on by the Combatant Status Review Tribunal's in Guantanamo remains consistent with the law of armed conflict itself, the Boumediene opinion is not a catastrophic blow to the government's authority to detain terrorists who participate in hostilities against the United States.  Instead, it has provided the opportunity and impetus for the government to finally reconcile it's assertion of detention authority with the law upon which it purports to apply - the law of armed conflict."
"October 19, 2008","The relationship and operational prospects of the linkage between Migration and Development in Sri Lanka must be placed in the recent historical developments. These are characterized on the one hand by an enduring civil war, which has lasted for more than 20 years and has affected the formation of governments, development policies and international aid priorities, and, on the other, by the Tsunami that hit the country on December 26th 2004, and which has left thousands of families without shelter and destroyed their primary sources of livelihood. The economic and physical insecurity in the areas affected by the conflict and by the natural disasters have served as a push factor for people to migrate, and hundreds of thousands of people have already left to"
"October 19, 2008","Truth commissions, usually described as a softer transitional justice alternative to trials, gained traction in academic circles following the establishment of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Though they are praised for their value in societal reconciliation and widely recognized for their flexibility; little is understood of their causal factors or requirements.  This Article turns to this hole in the research and examines the effects of one potential causal variable, the balance of power between the warring parties.  Through an in-depth examination of four case studies, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, and East Timor, this Article finds that truth commissions are more likely to be implemented following conflicts that have ended without a clear and absolute winner.  The analysis suggests two things: first, scholars should shift from the ends-based analysis of what works best to the means-based analysis of what will be possible; and second, a quest for truth may first require a need for compromise."
"October 16, 2008","Research in the discipline of international relations finds that the democratic great powers are less likely to pursue revisionist policies. This investigation challenges this argument by showing that the United States' decision to oust Saddam Hussein's regime in March 2003 were consistent with a modified version of John Mearsheimer's theory of offensive realism, which finds that great powers' motivation is global hegemony. This investigation is divided into three sections. Section one considers the value of Mearsheimer's theory and reworks it by adding domestic variables to explain why states abandon defensive strategies for offensive ones. The second section shows how pre-9/11 American foreign policy strategy was, for the most part, status quo oriented, while section three shows why and how the Bush administration introduced a revisionist foreign policy strategy after the 9/11 attacks. This investigation concludes by showing how the 2003 Iraq war is the first step in the United States' quest for global hegemony."
"October 16, 2008","This article examines why the U.N. Security Council supported the Anglo-American project to transform Iraq, even though the international law of occupation prohibits this type of project. It is divided into four sections. Section one presents the article's framework of analysis, which is based on Detlev Vagt's (2001) conceptualization of hegemonic international law and Jose Alvarez's (2003) recent application of this concept to recent debates in international law. The second section assesses the impact American hegemony has had on international law in the post-Cold War era, arguing that American neo-liberal values and its idealized vision of intrastate order have influenced international institutions' strategies. The third section studies the UN's postwar mission in Kosovo. It not only shows how this is an example of American hegemonic international law, but it helps explain why the Security Council may have been compelled to support the Anglo-American project to transform Iraq. The last section considers the debate regarding the United Kingdom and the United States' request for a resolution legitimating its occupation of Iraq. It demonstrates that Resolution 1483 met most of the occupying powers' demands, confirming that it was an outcome of American hegemonic international law."
"October 13, 2008","This short Comment describes the most important changes to the Exon-Florio CFIUS framework introduced by the National Security Act of 2007 and evaluates the extent to which the updated legislation strikes a reasonable balance between national security concerns and promoting the inflow of foreign capital in the United States. The Comment provides a brief overview of the history of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS) and discusses the key criticisms that have been levied against the CFIUS review process. The recent amendments to the CFIUS framework are analyzed in light of several emerging realities in the markets for investment and regulation, including the increased visibility of sovereign wealth funds and the greater interplay between the regulatory frameworks of developed countries seeking to attract foreign investment."
"October 08, 2008","At first glance, the question of the legitimacy of rebels in international law may sound a bit awkward if not utterly absurd. Indeed, rebels are classically identified by opposition to the legitimate governments. This means that their illegitimacy is a constitute element of their status of insurgent. In other words, they are deemed rebels because they violently oppose the legitimate government. Moreover, it is not entirely certain the question of legitimacy, as a whole, is an issue to be taken up by international legal scholars. However, there still are a few hypotheses where a test of the legitimacy of the rebels is carried out in practice, the result of which impinges on the application of international law. It is the aim of this paper to grapple with these few exceptional situations where the legitimacy of the rebels is examined. To that end, a distinction is drawn between separatist rebellions, political rebellions and the situation of failed States."
"October 08, 2008","In 1996, Congress, as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, amended the list of noncommercial tort exceptions to sovereign immunity in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (""FSIA"") in response to a federal court's determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Libya and alleged Libyan terrorists in Smith v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, one of many cases resulting from the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.  The ambiguously worded amendment appears to give federal courts both subject matter jurisdiction, which Congress clearly intended, and personal jurisdiction over the seven nations currently listed by the Executive Branch as ""state sponsors of terrorism."" The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the only court to address the amended FSIA, unconstitutionally interpreted it as according the court personal jurisdiction over Libya in the re-filed suit by the survivors, executors, administrators, and personal representatives of those killed over Lockerbie.  This Article demonstrates that giving the court personal jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign simply because the Executive Branch has concluded that it is a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" or because an offshore terrorist act had some ""effect"" in the United States would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment absent the performance of traditional ""minimum contacts"" analysis under both the specific and general personal jurisdiction tests."
"October 07, 2008","This commentary on the security exception provision embedded in the GATS pioneers in that it discusses issues of national security relating to trade in services in a dynamic manner taking into account current threats and contentious issues relating to WTO Members' essential security interests. Case-law is critically discussed to identify judicial interpretations that may be valid under the GATS."
"October 07, 2008","WTO arbitrators rely on economics to establish the permissible retaliation limits authorized by the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) which arguably serves to enforce the overall agreement. We examine how theoretical and quantitative economic analysis has and can be used in this stage of the DSU process. First, we identify, characterize, and categorize the major classes of disputes - e.g., those affecting import protection versus export promotion - and use the Bagwell and Staiger interpretation of the WTO principle of reciprocity to provide a theoretical framework that arbitrators can use to identify the maximum level of retaliatory countermeasures. Second, we allocate each of the ten DSU arbitrations that have taken place thus far into one of these categories and compare the arbitrators' actual approach with the theory. Third, we use this framework to identify three crucial elements to the arbitrators' decision-making process for each case: i) the formula that they decide to adopt for identifying appropriate countermeasures, ii) their political-legal-economic decision on a WTO-consistent counterfactual to use to implement the formula, and iii) the quantitative methods they use to necessarily construct the (unobserved) WTO-consistent counterfactual. We examine not only the arbitrations that have taken place thus far, but our approach also illustrates a template for many additional types of arbitrations likely to take place under the DSU. Finally, in the disputes in which this reciprocity approach has not been used, we identify procedural difficulties that arbitrators confront thus highlighting the constraints that hinder their use of economic analysis in practice."
"October 06, 2008","There have been numerous unsuccessful attempts to define terrorism generically in international treaty law since the 1920s, from early conferences on the unification of criminal law to efforts in the League of Nations, the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly. While these sources do not carry great weight as evidence of customary law, they illustrate the recurring normative and political disputes surrounding definition and elucidate the basic features of an international prohibition and/or crime of terrorism, as perceived by different international actors. The recurrent attempts at definition indicate that the international community attaches considerable normative importance to it. Drafting of a UN Comprehensive Terrorism Convention continues in the Sixth Committee, and the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change advocated definition in treaty law in late 2004. Generic definition of terrorism can capture and stigmatize the political motives which distinguish terrorism from ordinary violent crime, or transnational organized crime for financial benefit. Following an historical pattern, agreement on the scope of any exceptions to a definition of terrorism remains the key obstacle, although much of the argument about exceptions is ideological, not substantive."
"October 06, 2008","In this paper I discuss the use of the state secrets privilege in the context of civil suits brought against the United States government and private contractors working for the federal government by alleged victims of extraordinary rendition. The paper focuses on how best to achieve meaningful oversight of the executive's actions and allow the courts to fulfill their important role of providing individuals the opportunity to have their rights vindicated and protected, while at the same time securing legitimate state secrets.  I hope that this focus on extraordinary rendition cases may also have broader applicability in other areas where the state secrets privilege is frequently asserted."
"October 06, 2008","With growth in the area of arbitration agreements relating to employment, credit cards, loans, and other form agreements, the issue of class-wide arbitration has become an area of significant judicial activity. However, increased judicial activity has not resulted in increased clarity; to the dismay of those parties seeking to pursue or avoid class-wide arbitration, the law on this issue has become unpredictable from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The United States Supreme Court has expressed the importance of the class-action as a valuable device for vindicating plaintiffs' rights. Additionally, the Supreme Court has recognized arbitration as a valuable form of dispute resolution. In contrast, when the class-action and arbitration are found in the form of class-wide arbitration, the Supreme Court has been less than swift in establishing binding precedent for the lower courts to follow. Although the Bazzle decision was concerned primarily with whether silent agreements preclude class-wide arbitration, this casenote will address class-wide arbitration in general, and the manner in which the Supreme Court treated the issue in Bazzle."
"October 06, 2008","United Nations Security Council adopted non-binding Resolution 1624 calling on States to prohibit by law incitement to commit a terrorist act or acts, prevent incitement, and deny safe haven or entry to inciters. The resolution was sponsored by the United Kingdom during the aftermath of the July 2005 terrorist bombings in London which announced new policy guidelines governing deportation, which listed unacceptable behaviours by non-UK citizens in Britain or abroad, which involved expressing views that foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs, and seek to provoke others to terrorist acts."
"October 06, 2008","A two-stage game depiction of counterterrorism is presented, where the emphasis is on the interaction between the preemptive and defensive measures taken by two targeted countries facing a common threat. The preemptor is likely to be the high-cost defender with the greater foreign interests. A prime-target country may also assume the preemptor role. The analysis identifies key factors – cost comparisons, foreign interests, targeting risks, and domestic terrorism losses – that determine counterterrorism allocations. The study shows that the market failures associated with preemptive and defensive countermeasures may be jointly ameliorated by a disadvantaged defender. Nevertheless, the subgame perfect equilibrium will still be suboptimal owing to a preemption choice that does not fully internalize the externalities."
"October 05, 2008","According to the diversionary war theory, problematic domestic circumstances motivate a country's leader to divert popular discontent by launching a militarized international crisis. Yet, empirical support for this argument has proved to be ambiguous at best. Relying on extant ethnic conflict research, we argue that the embattled leader can elicit public support by using armed force against ethnic minorities within his/her country. We call this option domestic diversion and argue that it is not only available to a larger number of leaders, but that it also often presents a less risky course of action than external diversion. Empirical tests of the domestic diversionary hypothesis show a connection between domestic problems facing the leader and the use of force against minorities. This finding provides a potentially new interpretation for the causes of some domestic conflicts, and suggests that the diversionary theory may operate on the domestic level of analysis."
"October 02, 2008","This article analyses ius in bellum questions arising from the 2006 war in Lebanon between Israel and Hizbollah. In particular, it examines Israel's claim to self-defence, Hizbollah's and Lebanon's international responsibility for the attack to which Israel responded."
"October 01, 2008","One of the most crucial components of the 2002 National Security Strategy which will impact virtually all other components is the world-wide implementation of the rule of law. In furtherance of the Strategy, National Security Presidential Directive 44 was issued in late 2005 and states that it is U.S. policy to work with other countries towards effective implementation of the rule of law. The Directive tasks the Secretaries of State and Defense with coordinating rule of law efforts and with integrating them into military contingency plans. Consequently, by direction of the President, the military has a key role to play in implementing the rule of law and Judge Advocates must be prepared to lead these efforts."
"October 01, 2008","If we define revolutionary change as the alteration of fundamental political arrangements in ways inconsistent with accepted understandings of law, we would not expect to find the invocation of law in justification of that change. In fact, however, such justification is not uncommon. This paper examines three cases exposing differing attitudes to legal justification of revolution - the English Revolution of 1688-89, the secession of the Southern states at the beginning of the American Civil War and the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. In each case the paper describes the revolutionaries' use of legal language. It then shows how the use or avoidance of positive law arguments correlated with social attitudes toward law in the relevant time and place."
"October 01, 2008","We study countries choosing armament levels and then whether or not to go to war. We show that if the costs of war are not overly high or low, then all equilibria must involve ""dove,"" ""hawk,"" and ""deterrent"" strategies and the probability of war is positive (but less than one) in any given period. Wars are between countries with differing armament levels and the frequency of wars is tempered by the presence of armament levels that are expressly chosen for their deterrent properties. As the probability of winning a war becomes more reactive to increased armament, the frequency of wars decreases. Finally, as it becomes increasingly possible to negotiate a credible settlement, the probability of peace increases, but the variance of armament levels increases and war becomes increasingly likely when negotiation is not available. This matches observed patterns in the data over time."
"September 29, 2008","This article examines how Peru's anti-terrorism legislation erected as part of its 20 year internal armed conflict against insurgent groups led to systematic violations of human rights. The defects of these laws, particularly those related to the lack of procedural due process rights, resulted in the arrest and detention of thousands of people, the majority of whom were eventually found innocent and released. These laws were eventually ruled unconstitutional by Peru's Constitutional Tribunal. However, before then, numerous people detained under the laws submitted their complaints to international human rights monitoring bodies such as the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the Inter-American Human Rights Commission and Court. Decisions by these institutions provide detailed guidance on legislative defects that per se violate non-derogable human rights, while also recognizing that those detained under these laws have a right to reparations. The author argues these precedents put other nations on notice as they design their own anti-terrorism legislation."
"September 28, 2008","The WTO faces an increasing burden of arbitrating trade disputes between WTO member states. The disputes are economically complex and often lead to rulings that require changes in Members' economic policies. This paper provides a positive and normative analysis of a previously unaddressed question: What roles do economic analysis and economists play in WTO adjudication under the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU)? We identify a number of problems with the current Secretariat provision of technical economic support to panellists and arbitrators as well as the sources of these problems - including the small number of professional economists in the Secretariat, the lack of diversity to their fields of specialization, and the ad hoc manner in which they have been integrated into the DSU adjudication process thus far. We also point the Secretariat to useful lessons on transparency and political independence learned from other institutions - e.g., central banks, competition authorities, and national trade remedy investigating agencies - that affect economic policy in similar politically sensitive environments. Finally, given a new mandate from WTO Members that DSU adjudicators have access to more sophisticated technical economic support and expertise, we make a number of proposals for reform."
"September 24, 2008","Congress’s national-security legislation will often require clear and specific congressional authorization before the executive can undertake certain actions.  The War Powers Resolution, for example, prohibits any law from authorizing military hostilities unless it “specifically authorizes” them.  And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 required its own amendment or repeal of its ""exclusive means"" provision before authorizing warrantless electronic surveillance.  But efforts to legislate clear-statement regimes in national-security law have failed to induce compliance.  The Clinton Administration inferred congressional ""authorization"" for the 1999 Kosovo War from an appropriations statute that failed to specifically authorize the conflict. And the Bush Administration inferred congressional ""authorization"" for the NSA surveillance program from ambiguous language in the post- September 11th Authorization to Use Military Force. In both situations, executive-branch lawyers employed expansive theories of implied repeal and constitutional avoidance to evade the codified clear-statement requirements, and Congress and the courts acquiesced to the President's actions. Recent proposals to strengthen the clear-statement requirements in Congress's national security framework legislation are unlikely to be effective without institutional mechanisms, such as points of order, that can deter future legislators from enacting vague or ambiguous legislation from which the executive might claim implicit congressional"" authorization,"" and that can induce Congress to confront Presidents who act without specific congressional authorization. Simply enacting more narrow or explicit clear-statement requirements, or adding funding restrictions to Congress's framework legislation, fails to counter the aggressive interpretive doctrines that executives of both political parties have used to concoct congressional ""authorization"" from vague or ambiguous statutory language."
"September 22, 2008","In this article, co-authored with James Cockayne, it is argued that the genesis of the Iraq Crisis of 2003 within the Security Council can be traced to earlier patterns of acquiescence by Council members in US and UK unilateral enforcement action in Iraq. By the time this acquiescence ceased, between 1994 and 1996, UK and US enforcement policy was set and would culminate in Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003."
"September 22, 2008","The regularity with which peace deals break down and civil wars resume is well established. This briefing looks at the factors that drive violent conflicts, and the factors that may undermine peace deals, including those brokered and supported by international third parties. For peace to last, agreements must be viable, credible and enforceable, and the commitment of donors must not be in doubt. For these conditions to be in place, conflict resolution must be in donors' interests."
"September 22, 2008","This paper identifies various theories explaining nuclear power acquisition and tests them against Iran. It argues that denuclearisation of countries, and not supporting nuclear armament to promote deterrence (if everyone has one, no one will use one) is the only method to solve the problem."
"September 22, 2008","A century after the birth of a father of peacekeeping, Ralph Bunche, UN peace operations have changed dramatically. The narrowly-defined, lightly-armed, strictly neutral operations of Bunche's day have become complex, multidisciplinary state-building operations. Then, peacekeeping buttressed essentially self-enforcing cease-fires; now, it aims to build the foundations of a self-renewing peace. These changes reflect six deeper shifts: the end of the Cold War; engagement with ""internal"" conflicts; rising regional organizations; North-South politics; the U.S.-UN relationship; and changes in peace operation mandates. These shifts create three future challenges: state building; reconceiving sovereignty; and the need for realism. The December 2004 High Level Panel Report proposes modest steps toward meeting those challenges, but the burden of realizing the proposed framework rests squarely with UN member states."
"September 22, 2008","This articles draws lessons on how the United Nations Security Council ought manage conflict and other threats to international peace and security from its long experience with Iraq. It suggests that the Security Council oscillated between a 'politico-military' and a 'legal-regulatory' approach to Iraq, without always fully appreciating the managerial and accountability complexities that flow from these two very different approaches."
"September 21, 2008","The Federal Arbitration Act mandates strict and uniform enforcement of standardized pre-dispute arbitration provisions.  This may not be proper, however, in light of the importance of context with respect to these provisions.  This Article therefore seeks to remind courts of the importance of exchange context by proposing a ""contracting culture"" continuum for enforcing these arbitration provisions that acknowledges the impacts of these provisions in a particular communal context.  ""Contracting culture"" encompasses economic and non-economic relational factors that impact dispute resolution agreements, but go beyond common conceptions of ""culture"" focused on ethnicity, nationality, or religion.  It also explores beyond the primary domestic versus international factors and spans contracting cultures ranging from ""intra communal"" to ""extra communal"" in order to highlight how parties' relations, understandings, and values may have the greatest impact on the fairness of form arbitration provisions."
"September 21, 2008","Law governing enforcement of ADR agreement not governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) has been uncertain, and often aimless.  This Article therefore calls for clarification of this law, through development of a modern contractual approach for enforcing these non-FAA ADR procedures.  Although courts may look to the FAA as a resource for evaluating and developing an enforcement approach, they also should employ modern contract and remedy tools that are more adaptive than the Act's summary enforcement because it allow courts to consider contextual, relational, and equitable factors when determining application of specific enforcement remedies.  This allows courts to apply these tools to foster contract compliance and cooperative relations, but to protect individuals from coerced participation in ADR that will cause undue financial or emotional hardship, or otherwise defeat the very purposes of ADR."
"September 21, 2008","On February 17, 2008, the Kosovar Parliament voted a resolution calling for the separation of Kosovo from its then mother state, Serbia. Within days, many western countries, including the United States, recognized Kosovo as a new state, despite strong Serbian opposition. Several other countries - Russia, Spain, and China, to name a few - opposed the Kosovar independence. In reality, Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since 1999 and remains dependant on international aid today in order to survive as an independent state. Thus, Kosovo is an independent dependant state, or a fascinating case study under international law. This article will attempt to decipher the ""myth"" of Kosovo, by analyzing in its first part the history of Kosovo and its relationship to Serbia, then the theories of secession, statehood and recognition under international law in its second part, the application of those theories to Kosovo in its third part, and finally, in its fourth part, the different theories that would justify the Kosovar independence and the future outlook of this new independent dependant state."

The article recommends that ethical rules shift to a multiple client representation model. The model would be based upon the Brandeisian ""lawyer for the situation"" and would empower attorneys in non-litigation settings to consider and evaluate the impact of their activities on other constituencies that the representation affects. Attorneys would become better able to encourage their clients to seek distributional fairness and balance in their business and personal legal activities to the possible long term advantage of both client and lawyer."
"September 20, 2008","This paper argues that Iran's ambitious Nuclear Power project can be satisfied by its Normative concern to be recognized as a ""modern"" state rather than as a ""pariah"". The normative justification is an important argument not yet completely realized by world community. Addressing this would help address the Iranian problem much more efficiently. The paper tests this using the Korean example and evidence available in expert articles."
"September 19, 2008","Few think of counterinsurgency as linked to constitutional design. Counterinsurgency is bottom-up; constitutional design is top-down. Counterinsurgency is military; constitutional design is political-legal. Counterinsurgency is temporary, transitional, and tactical, designed to stabilize society; constitutional systems come later and are permanent, constant, and normal. But the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate the fallacy of these perceptions. Counterinsurgency and constitutional design took place simultaneously, they required high-level political agreement and ground-level acceptance, and they involved politics, law, and security. Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate that these two enterprises are not different and disconnected, but rather intricately interconnected and complementary."

Part Two briefly surveys the paradigm-breaking scientific work of Stephan Riess, with its relevance to providing much-needed additional supplies of potable fresh water, particularly in the Middle East.  In Part Three we will address the interface between water resources and water rights in the Middle East, considering two river systems of particular interest: the Euphrates and Tigris river system and the Jordan Valley."
"September 18, 2008","This article aims to discuss the issue of whether the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) endorsed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is an arbitral process according to the principles of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. For this purpose, this article will first establish the true meaning of arbitration, moving on to illustrate how it has been incorporated with the introduction of the Internet and, specifically, the interaction between Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms. Furthermore, this article will demonstrate how ICANN has used arbitration and ADR methods to deal with the conflict between trademarks and domain names; for this purpose, a short history of the UDRP will be mentioned and the Policy will be later compared to conventional arbitration in order to prove that the UDRP is not an arbitral process, at least according to the way arbitration is conceived. Finally, this paper will illustrate that ICANN's Policy has created a whole new process for deciding domain name disputes that has a rather ambiguous nature."
"September 18, 2008","Enabled by modern network technologies, power is ""shifting to the edge"", allowing decentralized networked groups to compete with traditional hierarchical organization forms.  The globalization of communications and computing infrastructure (together with new collaborative software) is allowing hostile non-state groups - including terrorists, criminal organizations, rogue corporations, anti-globalization movements, pernicious hackers, and proxy groups acting on behalf of or ""encouraged"" by other nation states or these other entities - to directly threaten national security and international stability.  Increasingly, existing security arrangements and practices based on rigid geographic borders, exclusive sovereign control of physical territory, and unilateral response to global threats by individual nation states are inadequate to counter these groups effectively."
"September 18, 2008","While overshadowed by rulings concerning the rights of detainees, executive power and judicial review in the war on terror, the Supreme Court recently issued three surprisingly significant decisions on international law."
"September 18, 2008","By re-analyzing latest conflict data (great power battle fatalities from all wars, Goldstein 1988 and COW/PRIO 2005) from 1495 to 2002 and as yet unpublished UNIDO data about the growth of world industrial production 1740-2004 it is shown that the long Kuznets and Kondratiev swings and cycles of capitalist world development that play such an important role in the analysis of global war since 1495 have indeed not ended after the end of Communism, and that instability, and not stability, characterizes the world economy, and that there is an indented 'W' shaped pattern of global conflict since 1495 that did not end with the end of the Cold War. To this effect, we present in this work new conflict data for the involvement of the Great Powers (from 1945 onwards UN Permanent Security Council members   Germany, before 1945 definition Goldstein 1988, based on the works of Levy, see page 235 in Goldstein 1988) in wars (annual battle fatalities) for the entire period 1945-2002, based on standard peace research data (PRIO Oslo, Correlates of War data)."
"September 15, 2008","Rising legalization in the international community has lead to greater use of international tribunals and soft law.  This paper explores the intersection of these instruments.  The decision of an international tribunal interprets binding legal obligations but is not itself legally binding except, in some instances, as between the parties.  The broader, and often more important function of a tribunal's decision - its influence on state behavior beyond the particular case and its impact on perceptions regarding legal obligations - is best characterized as a form of soft law."
"September 15, 2008","New technologies have always posed challenges to established legal norms.  Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) in particular pose legal and ethical challenges to the law, and create never before seen legal problems.  Although the ABA House of Representatives recently approved the Model Act Governing Assisted Reproductive Technology, differences in laws and rules will continue to exist.  The legal issues involved are wide-ranging, including: liability issues arising from the failure of ART technology, parentage issues, disposition of embryos, and many others.  As ART becomes more widely used, it is also used more in an interstate and international context.  Thus, when a dispute arises, it often involves litigants from different states, and therefore creates the potential of conflicting laws."
"September 15, 2008","This work is a chapter for a forthcoming book on The Essentials of International Criminal Law to be published by Aspen Publishers as part of its Essentials series. This chapter discusses the contested concept of terrorism under international law, with a focus on efforts to criminalize the phenomenon. In particular, it discusses the major obstacles to achieving an omnibus definition of the crime with a particular emphasis on the intersection of the prohibitions against terrorism and international humanitarian law. Additional chapters in the text address the history of ICL, the sources of ICL, the major international crimes and defenses, and ICL reasoning and rhetoric. Publication is expected in October 2008."
"September 15, 2008","This work is a chapter for a forthcoming book on The Essentials of International Criminal Law to be published by Aspen Publishers as part of its Essentials series. This chapter discusses one of the major conundrums of international criminal law (ICL): how to distinguish international crimes (war crimes, crimes against humanity, terrorism, and genocide) from their domestic analogs (murder, assault, and mayhem). The chapter discusses the various approaches to ""internationalization"" (focusing on issues of identity, transnationalism, human dignity, global stability, etc.) and concludes that international crimes lack a coherent unifying justification. Additional chapters in the text address the history of ICL, the sources of ICL, the major international crimes and defenses, and ICL reasoning and rhetoric. Publication is expected in October 2008."
"September 15, 2008","International law scholars debate when international law matters to states, how it matters, and whether we can improve compliance. One of the few areas of agreement is that fairly robust levels of compliance can be achieved by tapping into states' concerns with their reputation. The logic is intuitively appealing: a state that violates international law develops a bad reputation, which leads other states to exclude the violator from future cooperative opportunities. Anticipating a loss of future gains, states will often comply with international rules that are not in their immediate interests. The level of compliance that reputation can sustain depends, however, on how the government decision-makers value the possibility of being excluded from future cooperative agreements. This paper examines how governments internalize reputational costs to the ""state"" and how audiences evaluate the predictive value of violating governments' actions. The paper concludes that international law's current approach to reputation is counterproductive, because it treats reputation as an error terms that makes rationalist's claim invariably correct."
"September 14, 2008","This Article examines the Islamic Community case by setting it within its historical and jurisprudential context and discussing the implications of the Human Rights Chamber's decision for the protection of human rights in Bosnia and beyond. Part I describes the structure and functions of the Chamber. Part II considers the applicant, the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the rich Muslim heritage of the city of Banja Luka. Part III explains the proceedings before the Chamber and the body's decision in Islamic Community. Part IV analyzes the difficulties faced by the Chamber and the international community in enforcing the decision. The Article concludes by exploring the implications of Islamic Community and the Chamber's jurisprudence for the protection of human rights in Bosnia and transitional justice efforts elsewhere in the world."
"September 11, 2008","The period that stretches from the end of the Cold War until today has weathered the emergence of a large number of new states. With each addition, the international community has striven to regulate statehood and rein in its most erratic and unpredictable manifestations.  In particular, the international community has tried to affect what kind of political regimes are set up in these new states. To reach that goal, multi-dimensional administrations have been set up by States or International Organizations to (re)build governmental institutions in territories where the governments have floundered completely. This strategy, while costly, has not been unsuccessful. Through international administrations of territories, several states have been rebuilt or restored, all of them endowed with democratic institutions. It is the aim of this Article to analyze the use of international administrations of territories to create or to reconstruct democratic states. After briefly recalling the status of democracy in international law (Section I), the Article explains how modern administrations of territories have proven to be democracy-building machines (Section II). Finally, it offers a critical appraisal of the contemporary resolve of the international community to create democratic states (Section III)."
"September 11, 2008","This is the English language version of an essay (10,000 words) appearing in the Revista de Libros (Madrid), considering the history and future of the United Nations and global governance through the lens of Paul Kennedy's recent work, The Parliament of Man. The essay is highly skeptical of what it describes as platonism about the future of the UN as the seat of global governance. It offers an alternative view of how to consider the work of the UN, in three areas: security, economic development, and values. The essay argues that, particularly with the rise of new great power tensions and multipolarity, the fantastic dream of the UN as the seat of a gradually arising global government, as Kennedy imagines things, should be given up in favor of a UN devoted to a modest set of quotidian tasks and the place for the great powers to engage in multilateral discussion, argument, and negotiation. (This essay will also be posted in Spanish on SSRN in its final published form in the Revista de Libros.)"
"September 11, 2008","Historically, issues of foreign, security and defence policy have been considerable stumbling blocks in the process of constitutionalisation of European integration. Developments in this area have been shaped by competing intergovernmentalist and supranationalist grand designs as well as by diverging preferences among the EU Member States in the area of security and defence. In the Lisbon Reform Treaty, the field of foreign, security and defence policy was attributed high relevance and it was possible to introduce some elements of reform, particularly regarding the institutional structures and flexible forms of integration. However, these innovations were still influenced by traditional divides among the Member States and many questions were left open, as this was the only way to reach an agreement. Furthermore, the consensus principle in this policy field was retained with hardly any changes, and areas which are 'domaines reservees' of the Member States were marked even more explicitly than before. In conclusion, it remains questionable whether the provisions on foreign, security and defence policy in the Lisbon Reform Treaty may turn out to be milestones. Nevertheless, it has become clear that these issues are important touchstones for dealing with differing basic outlooks on European integration as well as with various national sensitivities."
"September 10, 2008","A recurring theme in the literature on common violence is that it stems from the combined impact of divided societies (poverty, ethnic diversity, economic inequality) and weak institutions (non-democratic, authoritarian government). This statistical regularity may hold in the aggregate, but as such it generates some instructive ""outliers"". Jamaica, for example, is not especially poor, has a virtually mono-ethnic population, relatively low levels of economic inequality, and has been steadily democratic since independence, but is yet among the most violent countries in the world. Why is this? How does one explain variations over time and place in the levels of violence? Drawing on extensive field research in Kingston's garrison communities, we argue that Jamaica generally, and Kingston in particular, experiences high levels of common violence because Jamaica is in fact neither ""cohesive"" nor ""democratic"", displaying instead important context-specific sources of social division and institutional weakness. A powerful regional political economy clearly constrains Jamaica's policy options, but given its nascent democratic institutions, external and domestic development actors alike can best assist efforts to lower common violence by recognizing and rewarding what Jamaican civil society organisations are doing already."
"September 10, 2008","This article examines the multiple layers at which international law now functions - the international, national, and sub-national. It identifies both public and private institutions and practices that have emerged to carry out international law's normative objectives. It ends with a call to expand the formal structure of international law to include the realities of a disaggregated state, a non-hierarchical system of governance, and a transnational political space."
"September 09, 2008","Traditional state v. state war is largely a relic. How then does a nation-state protect itself - preemptively - against the unseen enemy? Existing international law - the Caroline Doctrine, UN Charter Article 51, Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 - do not provide sufficiently clear guidelines regarding when a state may take preemptive or anticipatory action against a non-state actor. This article proposes rearticulating international law to allow a state to act earlier provided sufficient intelligence is available.  After examining international law, this article proposes a process-based ""strict-scrutiny"" approach to self-defense. Under this approach, the executive will have to convince a court, based on relevant, reliable, viable, and corroborated intelligence, that preemptive action is appropriate. This process leads to a check on the power o the executive by placing a judicial check on preemptive action, consequently establishing objective legal criteria for operational counterterrorism."
"September 09, 2008","On 2 February 2007 the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General unveiled a comprehensive proposal for a supervised independence of Kosovo with a view of clinching the last chapter of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia. This proposal constitutes a further attempt by the international community of states to bridle the volatile and unpredictable phenomenon of statehood. The state of Kosovo that is envisaged by the Status Settlement is to be endowed with all the features that are nowadays seen as indispensable for the establishment of a modern government apparatus, a tendency that had already been observed in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina or East Timor. The proposed regulation of statehood in this case, however, proves to be of an unprecedented extent. Against that backdrop, the article grapples with the legal questions revolving around the independence of Kosovo, including secession, recognition, succession, international supervision, self-determination, and membership of international organizations."
"September 09, 2008","This report, the synthesis of a forthcoming book to be published at Nova Science Publishers, New York, is based on the quantitative, multivariate analysis of the World Values Survey data from more than 80 countries around the globe on the political and social values of the world's Muslim communities by international comparison."
"September 08, 2008","A renewed effort to secure ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is now being considered in Irish Government circles, in an effort to avoid the serious potential political and economic consequences for Ireland of continued non-ratification. This paper asks which means of securing such ratification of the Lisbon Treaty are legally and politically appropriate. Should ratification be attempted only if popular approval can be secured in a fresh referendum? Or should the Government follow the suggestion that a referendum be dispensed with to whatever extent is legally possible, and replaced by parliamentary approval? Such questions involve both legal and political issues."
"September 06, 2008","The conventional wisdom is that treatment of prisoners during the Crusades, in an age long before the development of the modern laws of war, can only have been horrendous. Historical evidence seems to partly vindicate this account, but is also testimony to how well prisoners were treated on some occasions. This chapter explores the impact that norms about the nature of war and how it should be waged had on the issue. It suggests that despite the religious intensity of the Crusades and the fact that they unfolded along civilizational divides, there were several strands within the Christian and probably even more the Moslem tradition which guaranteed a degree of moderation in warfare, particularly protection for prisoners. The conclusion is that an overarching law of war is not necessarily a pre-condition to restraint in warfare, as long as a number of other circumstances exist such as a strong deontological imperative of self-restraint."
"September 06, 2008","One would expect that a Communist state that espoused centralized control and economic planning would have a powerful ministry regulating every facet of the country's energy affairs.  After all, few issues in 2008 are treated by the Chinese leadership with more urgency than energy security.  However, not only does such a governmental body not exist, repeated attempts to create even a watered-down version have only recently, and painfully, come to fruition."
"September 06, 2008","During the five years since its inception, the Department of Homeland Security promulgated 13 economically significant regulations, costing a total of at least $4 billion annually. This study evaluates the quality of regulatory analysis that DHS has produced for these regulations. Compared to the ideal articulated in Executive Order 12866 and accompanying OMB guidance, most of these analyses are seriously incomplete. DHS, OMB, and Congress can all take steps to remedy this deficiency. The department should hire more economists, involve them early in developing alternatives, manage them in a way that ensures their job is to conduct objective analysis, and learn from both its own and other agencies' best practices in regulatory analysis. OMB should aggressively promote analysis of alternatives when it reviews DHS regulations and amend Executive Order 12866 to clarify that it expects agencies to analyze all reasonable alternatives, even if they would require a change in the law. Congress should give DHS greater discretion to craft regulations and give DHS deadlines that allow adequate time to conduct quality regulatory analysis.  Congress should also hold DHS accountable by specifically articulating and measuring the outcomes the regulations are supposed to accomplish. If Congress declines to give DHS more discretion or time, then it should arrange for an objective analysis of alternatives by the Government Accountability Office or other independent entity."
"September 06, 2008","This article discusses how the Ethiopian state can maintain the level of protection of human rights necessary to protect its standing in the international community while at the same time respecting and incorporating within its formal legal system the multiple customary law systems existing within its borders. The article describes the modern Ethiopian State and the ethnic composition of the Ethiopian people, with particular reference to the Amhara, Gumuz and Somali peoples, and it examines the treatment of homicide within the customary law systems of these three peoples (with focusing on the right to life, the protection of female children against exploitation, and the right of women not to be discriminated against on the basis of their gender). The article examines in detail the interplay between customary law systems, modern notions of human rights, federalism and legal pluralism, and it considers procedural mechanisms useful for reconciling the formal Ethiopian legal system and the informal Ethiopian customary law systems. Finally, the article proposes a plan of action for the Ethiopian government that will respect and preserve the customary law, concluding that the key to success is adoption of a maximally flexible system of legislative federalism."
"September 06, 2008","This Article constructs frameworks for analyzing federalism's undertheorized horizontal dimension.  Discussions of federalism generally focus on the hierarchical (or vertical) allocation of power between the national and state governments while overlooking the horizontal allocation of power among coequal states.  Models of federal-state relations tend to treat the fifty states as a single aggregate unit, obscuring the fact that individual states often cannot concurrently exercise their powers without infringing the other states' autonomy, frustrating the others' legitimate interests, or burdening the others' citizens.  Preserving interstate harmony and protecting citizens from excessive burdens therefore requires limits on how states may wield their shared authority.  Constitutional law currently addresses these limits in a piecemeal fashion through doctrines regulating such diverse subjects as personal jurisdiction, restraints on interstate commerce, choice of law, federal subject-matter jurisdiction, interstate compacts, federal common law, tax apportionment, interjurisdictional preclusion, and discrimination based on state citizenship.  This Article moves beyond the piecemeal approach by identifying facets of horizontal federalism that transcend doctrinal categories.  Considering these common features without the distraction of historically contingent doctrinal labels can help reconfigure jurisprudence that is often unprincipled, unsatisfying, and unstable."
"September 06, 2008","This article uses The Attorney General's Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Domestic Security/Terrorism Investigations (1983) as a springboard for examining the fourth and first amendment implications of government surveillance of domestic political organizations by informers, for exploring the question of whether the surveillance of such groups by informers violates those persons' legitimate expectations of privacy, and for arguing that, since such surveillance not only implicates the fourth amendment but also may have a chilling effect upon the exercise of first amendment rights, the fourth amendment must be read more strictly than usual when domestic political surveillance is in issue."
"September 04, 2008","The Arctic - the undiscovered, expanse, at the top of the world.  In a world that has seen unprecedented change and development, the Arctic is still an undiscovered, underappreciated, and understudied realm.  This region has become an increasingly important area as Russia and Canada, struggle for control over the frozen mass that sits conveniently on top of the world, while also exploring conceptions of national identity.  This paper will discuss what control of the region means in a geopolitical sense and how it plays into Canada's sense of identity, balanced against Russian designs on the region which also concern a sense of national identity.  Historical, military, environmental, and cultural forces are all at play, but this article will delve into an analysis of national identity politics, developing connections between the Arctic and Canada that warrant increased Canadian awareness of the Arctic's geopolitical significance.  The article's hypothesis is that control of the Arctic is an important cultural representation of power, and that Canada's cultural identity is intertwined with the region to such an extent that Canada must exert strong influence in the area in order to promote its sovereignty and to encourage the appreciation of Canadian identity and the development of Canada's expanded presence in the international arena."
"September 03, 2008","One of the most important developments in international political and legal theory over the last two decades has been the assertion that norms affect state behavior.  Scholars have claimed that states are constrained by norms of appropriate behavior and furthermore that norms actually change (reconstitute) states' understandings of their interests thereby leading states to adapt their behavior in accordance with these new understandings. We test the proposition that norms alter state behavior with respect to the expanding international norm against torture from 1985 through 2003. Unfortunately, we find no evidence that the spreading of the international norm against torture, measured by the percentage of countries in the world that have acceded to the UN Convention Against Torture, has lead to any reduction in torture according to a variety of measures."
"September 03, 2008","This article asserts that counter-terror military operations should be regulated by fundamental principles of the law of armed conflict.  It builds on prior articles asserting an emerging category of transnational armed conflict: conflict between states and non-state groups outside the territory of the state. These prior articles have explained why such a category of armed conflict must be recognized and how the nature of the authority invoked by a state in the conduct of such operations reveals the existence of such armed conflicts.  This article focuses on the key law of armed conflict principles that should apply in such situations to regulate the application of combat power and the treatment of non-combatants. It acknowledges that this is only the first step in developing a body of regulatory norms applicable to such armed conflicts, but also points out the correlation between this proposed process and the development of the law applicable to internal armed conflicts."
"September 02, 2008","Political leaders of  emerging economies of India and China, where the state has not yet reached the maturity stage, prefer nuclear power to other alternative energy sources, as it serves the dual purpose of retaining state's hegemony on citizens' basic energy needs and assuring supply of weapon grade ingredients. In contrast with North America and most of Western Europe, where growth of nuclear power have leveled out for many years, the 'greatest growth in nuclear generation' in near future is expected in China, Japan, South Korea and India."
"September 01, 2008","This Article examines the emerging norm of customary international law prohibiting the death penalty to determine whether the norm applies in cases of genocide. Although the analysis is complicated by the fact that international norms are built on the foundation of state practice and cases of genocide are historically rare, the analysis in Part I nonetheless finds strong reasons for excluding genocide from any such emerging norm. In Part II, the Article examines why retentionist states might employ the death penalty in cases of genocide and how such reasons are cognizable under international law. In Part III, the Article explores the dilemma of respecting human rights norms and respecting a state's legitimate policy reasons for retaining the death penalty in extreme circumstances such as genocide. The Article resolves this tension by recognizing that restoring international peace and security is the central goal of international criminal justice.  Specifically, breaches to collective peace and security cannot be repaired if victim groups reject the legitimacy of a criminal process with inadequate penalties for genocide and turn instead to self-help reprisals that frustrate the reconciliatory goals of international law."
"August 31, 2008","This article takes federal courts to task for failing to analyze systematically the question of who - court or arbitrator - should determine whether a prior decision bars subsequent arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act because of res judicata.  When federal courts improperly determine that they rather than arbitrators should so decide, they frustrate legislative policies embodied in the Federal Arbitration Act favoring arbitration and impose on the parties a court resolution process that they did not bargain for.  Such judicial intervention effectively denies parties the freedom to contract as they see fit and the benefits of arbitration to which they are entitled."
"August 31, 2008","1989 was described as ‘annus mirabilis’, and its revolutions hailed as one of the great moments in human history. In subsequent years, the re-emergence of war, genocide and terror led to re-interpretation: Europe became a dark continent, the 20th century its darkest hour. Was 1989 merely a bright moment in a dark age?"
"August 31, 2008","Telecommunications and computing technologies have seen radical change over the last decade. The mainstream adoption of e-mail, mobile telephones and the Web and the growing use of peer-to-peer Voice over IP telephony have significantly altered the way we communicate. Massive increases in computing and data storage capability have given states new tools for eavesdropping on these communications. The legal frameworks controlling such invasions of privacy have struggled to keep up. Using the extensive legislative framework recently developed in the UK as a case study, along with examples from other common law and European jurisdictions, this chapter describes legal measures that can be put in place to prevent the abuse of these powerful new surveillance technologies by governments."
"August 31, 2008","As the Internet has become a mainstream communications mechanism, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have developed new surveillance capabilities and been given new legal powers to monitor its users. These capabilities have been particularly targeted toward terrorism suspects and organisations, which have been observed to use the Internet for communication, propaganda, research, planning, publicity, fundraising and creating a distributed sense of community. Policing has become increasingly pre-emptive, with a range of activities criminalised as ""supporting"" or ""apologising for"" terrorism. The privacy and non-discrimination rights that are core to the European legal framework are being challenged by the increased surveillance and profiling of terrorism suspects. We argue that their disproportionate nature is problematic for democracy and the rule of law, and will lead to practical difficulties for cross-border cooperation between law enforcement agencies."
"August 31, 2008","This article takes international courts and tribunals to task for avoiding all consideration of the underlying merits when determining interim relief and proposes instead a qualified consideration thereof that would weed out those applications that have no merit to them but yet avoids fostering the appearance of prejudgment.  Specifically, this article proposes that in international disputes, an applicant for interim relief should have to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of success (but no more) on the underlying merits, a position that finds support in the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration."
"August 31, 2008","This Article criticizes how both sides in the abortion debate have treated the concepts of ""human life"" and personhood.  Much legal scholarship has focused on whether abortion should be permitted, but little attention has been cast on the role of rhetoric in the debate. The Article argues that appeals to ""human life"" are vague and deceptive, since most conservatives would not consistently treat a fetus as a legal person. Conservatives can commit only to a ""thin"" conception of life (an embryo or fetus is a human organism in the process of developing into a person) even as they trade on the more emotionally compelling ""thick"" notions that the term ""life"" invokes."
"August 29, 2008","This Article critically analyzes the principal legal arguments made to justify the use of force by the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. The author argues that the revisions in the law of state responsibility as well as UN Security Council acceptance support the use of force in Afghanistan, but the use of force in Iraq was neither justified by existing doctrines of self-defense nor authorized or accepted by the UN Security Council."
"August 29, 2008","The Fourth Amendment protects Americans within the borders of the United States, but its applicability outside American territory is less clear.  I maintain that Fourth Amendment protections should cover wiretap evidence seized abroad, not just that gathered domestically.  These protections should apply whenever a prosecutor seeks to admit such evidence in criminal prosecutions in the United States.  Such protections are fundamental whenever the government acts to gather or use evidence, whether that evidence was obtained outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or not."
"August 29, 2008","This reading identifies how the law, regulators and corporate governance codes have introduced and/or have facilitated unethical practices that jeopardize corporate performance of publicly traded firms. The reading argues that the need for corporate governance codes arises because lawmakers, regulators and stock exchanges have been irresponsible in allowing directors to obtain excessive and inappropriate governance powers that can corrupt both themselves and the business to harm stakeholders. Amendments in corporate constitutions for eliminating and/or mitigating unethical practices that would also further the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders are described that in many jurisdictions would not require changes in the law.  The amendments would separate governance powers of directors from those required to manage the business.  The division of power creates checks and balances similar to that found in the US constitution or in the lending covenants used by bankers or in the shareholder agreements of venture capitalist."
"August 28, 2008","This policy overview draws upon two studies, one theoretical and one empirical, to explore lessons from medieval Indian Ocean trade for supporting ethnic tolerance in contemporary settings. The overview begins by sketching a model of inter-ethnic trade and violence in environments where there are  ""local"" and ""non-local"" ethnic groups. The model suggests that three conditions are necessary to support peaceful coexistence between these groups over time: complementarities between groups, a high cost to replicate or expropriate the source of another group's complementarity, and a mechanism to share the gains from inter-group exchange. The article then describes how these conditions were satisfied among Hindus and Muslim traders in medieval Indian ports from the rise of Islam to European ascendance in the 17th century. The paper characterises the institutions that emerged to bolster religious tolerance in these towns during the medieval period and that continued to support religious tolerance two centuries after the decline of Muslim dominance in overseas trade. Finally, the paper draws lessons from the theory and India's institutional legacy to understand why ethnic tolerance fails and how tolerance may be fostered in contemporary settings."
"August 28, 2008","The use of harsh interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects is typically justified on utilitarian grounds.  The present research suggests, however, that those who support such techniques are fuelled by retributive motives.  An experimental study conducted with a broad national sample of U.S. residents found that the desire for harsh interrogation is largely isomorphic with the desire to punish, and that both effects are mediated by the perceived moral status of the target, but not the perceived effectiveness of the interrogation.  Results are discussed with regard to retributive justice and the national policy on interrogation and torture."
"August 27, 2008","Despite rhetoric supporting liberal values and institutions, the governments of developed countries provide continued development and military assistance to the world's worst dictators.  This aid sustains the status quo and imposes significant costs on ordinary citizens. This paper reviews the foreign aid provided to the worst living dictators. We consider arguments for the continued provision of aid as well as reasons why aid fails to improve the situations in countries ruled by these dictators. The main conclusion is that if the goal of developed countries is to foster liberal economic, political and social institutions abroad, they should cease providing aid to the world's worst dictators."
"August 24, 2008","This essay argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Boumediene v. Bush, its latest pronouncement on the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, should be understood as a jurisdiction-stripping case.  Most of the commentators to address the case so far have seen it as a case about the war on terror, or about the reach of habeas corpus.  I argue that this decision takes significant steps toward resolving a debate that has been raging among the giants of constitutional law for more than 50 years:  Can Congress ""strip"" jurisdiction from the federal courts to prevent them from hearing certain important cases?"
"August 23, 2008","To provide a way to understand warfare and debate military conduct, Michael Walzer's Just and Unjust Wars tries to show that civilians and soldiers are not separated by a barrier of violence as we might think, but rather inhabit the same moral world.  While this view enables us to question and criticize our leaders during times of war instead of simply claiming ignorance, its success is gained by obscuring certain fundamental boundaries that exist between combatants and noncombatants.  By comparing Walzer's just war theory with the existential theories of Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger, we can therefore find a more complete picture of what it means to declare war and what it means to engage in combat.  This will allow us to see that what separates the soldier from the civilian is our everyday avoidance of death and anything associated with it.  Through an investigation into the relationship between death and killing we can then ask, from an existential standpoint, whether we can call any war just so long as our evasion of death also results in our evasion of what soldiers must go through to protect us, thus preventing the soldier from being able to truly return home."
"August 22, 2008","This is volume 32, chapter 191, Appleman's on Insurance 2d. This treatise chapter discusses insurance case law arising from acts of terrorism, including those arising from the September 11 attacks and pre-9/11 instances of terrorism. It analyzes the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2005 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. Among other things, it discusses coverage issues, including the problems of overbroad coverage and potential gaps. Lastly, policy considerations surrounding TRIA are discussed including insurance industry strategies, the difficulties of assessing terrorism risks, the effect of TRIA subsidized insurance on the market, and the benefits and problems such subsidized insurance engender."
"August 22, 2008","In the paper, using a political altruism model, we make an attempt to explain why an upstream country might agree to a treaty that recognizes and enforces the water claims of a downstream country.  In a natural extension of the standard economic model, it is possible to explain the above phenomena, by allowing for altruism between countries.  The altruistic concerns of the countries are dependent on the other country's willingness to have a good political relationship.  If both the countries maintain favorable political relations with one another, then the upstream country will care about the impacts of its water diversion on the downstream country's welfare.  The paper also illustrates the case of water sharing of the Ganges River between India and Bangladesh.  The Ganges River, like many other rivers in the world, ignores political boundaries.  In Bangladesh, the final downstream country along with Ganges, freshwater availability depends on the share of water diverted by the upstream country, India.  For decades, India and Bangladesh failed to resolve the water-sharing issues of the Ganges River.  However in 1996, both India and Bangladesh signed a major new agreement on water sharing (Ganges River Treaty) in an effort to resolve the dispute.  Using the political altruism model developed in the paper, we examine why despite needing more water than is available under the treaty, India has adapted to shortages instead of resorting to conflict with Bangladesh."
"August 22, 2008","This articles exposes the methodological errors involved in attempting to operationalize or value-neutralize the concept of 'terrorism.' It defends, instead, an effects-based approach to the taxonomy of 'terrorism' that builds out from a central conceptual connection between the term's negative connotation and a widely shared moral presumption against the killing of innocent non-combatants. Although this approach to the core meaning of 'terrorism' is far from value-neutral, it has a number of virtues to recommend it. First, it has the political virtue of even-handedness in the way it enables competing appraisals of asymmetric conflicts. Second, it is has the ethical virtue of being flexible enough to accommodate nuanced appraisals of various modes and degrees of terrorist violence. And third, it has the empirical virtue of being useful for purposes of rigorous social scientific research."
"August 21, 2008","Under international law, civilians suffering injuries that are incidental, that is unintentional and proportionate, to a lawful attack on a military objective, are left to bear the cost of their losses. In recent years there have been calls for a change in policy, which would entitle victims of military attacks to compensation, even if their losses sustained are incidental and non-fault based. Such a quasi-strict liability rule, while morally laudable, is likely to disrupt the existing balance of powers and interests under the laws of armed conflict and therefore requires close examination. This article begins with an exploration of the conceptual basis for such an obligation, which informs the scope of arguments in support of and opposition to the proposal. It then examines the effect of a strict liability rule on the conduct of parties to a conflict, taking into account that for individual victims, avoidance is always preferable to compensation. This examination is based on an economic analysis. A final question is how to ensure that the liability of the injuring party translates into an effective mechanism for securing compensation. The article concludes that if the moral commitment to victims justifies a strict liability rule, considerations of utility require and can be met with a fine-tuning of the obligation and its implementing mechanisms"

"August 21, 2008","This paper explores the micro-foundations of conflict generation and persistence within the traditional greed and grievance non-cooperative set up between a government and a rebel group. We expand the traditional model in various ways. First, we allow for the reaction curves of both parties in non-cooperative games to be substitutes and not inevitably complementary, so a peaceful strategy from a group may be followed by a belligerent upsurge from the other. Second, we also allow for diasporas' transfers to rebel groups, thus generating a trade-off between the gains associated with peace and war among rebels. Third, we expand external aid in the form of fungible financing of government transfers 'buying' peace by allowing for mechanisms that induce behavioural change towards peace in a cooperative model of principal-agent well-intended (Nordic-like) donors. These extensions provide a better understanding of conflict persistence, the consequences of competing international aid and why sub-optimal sanctions provision ('cheap talk') by the international community are frequent."
"August 20, 2008","Terrorist finance is the culprit behind the success of terror activities. Terrorist activities rely heavily on financial operations to operate successfully similar to fiscally stable states. This study examines the political economy of terrorist financing by looking into the relationship between terrorism and its underlying financial structure. Terrorist finance exists in three forms: as a completely separate structure from terrorist organizations, as a subsidiary structure or as a dependent structure. Independent financing methods usually are front businesses or individual donors who support terrorist organizations with clean money. Subsidiary structures are charities which have a symbiotic existence with terrorists and dependent structures are criminal activities promoted or protected by terrorists. This framework explains the success of several terror organizations in implementing their activities and possible solutions to the problem. The research concludes that terrorist financing and terrorist organizations are not necessarily one and the same and that their close operation is an important factor in their success. Governments need to pay particular attention to this link and its outcomes if counter terror activities are to have some modicum of success."
"August 20, 2008","One of the most damaging and increasing problems in our schools today is student teasing and bullying. The research is clear: Victims and bystanders of bullying will experience emotional scars with long-term effects. This Article discusses the failure of the traditional legal system to prevent bullying and to provide appropriate compensation for its victims. In addition, the Article introduces a new approach to conflict resolution in our schools called the Social Inclusion Approach. Based upon principles of Restorative Justice, the Social Inclusion Approach seeks to change the climate of the school and give the bystanders the power to say, ""Stop."" Finally, this article discusses a model anti-bullying statute that requires schools to adopt and implement research-based, whole-school approaches to end bullying. It is only in a school environment where teasing and bullying are out of place that we can truly get a handle on this subversive and difficult community problem."
"August 19, 2008","The NPT non-proliferation regime is both a multilateral treaty of international law and a dispute system designed to manage conflict over the use of nuclear technology.  The system seeks to balance the competing desires of member-states to have access to peaceful nuclear technology and to provide national security.  In the course of implementation, the system must handle disputes over alleged violations of the NPT and IAEA safeguards agreements.  Negotiations, crucial to the functioning of the NPT dispute system, are undertaken in the shadow of the law and the shadow of violence.  The NPT and any relevant agreement signed with the IAEA serve as a legal endowment, a set of rules that allocate rights and obligations for all parties involved.  This legal framework acknowledges and incorporates various means of coercion, including the use of armed force, in order to enforce those rights and obligations.  Still, the system has no monopoly on coercion and violence, as states can act outside of the system's structure to influence actors within it. This article applies dispute systems design principles to analyze the NPT as a dispute system for nuclear proliferation concerns, and examines three case studies of non-proliferation negotiations - North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan - to see how negotiations were influenced by legal endowments and the shadow of violence."
"August 19, 2008","While the Sri Lankan government's recent military onslaught against the LTTE has been surprisingly successful, history is clear that a meaningful solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka will be found not on the battlefield but in the hearts and minds of the Sri Lankan people. The causes of the conflict are several - an analysis of these sources of intractability involves both a backward looking appreciation of the events, perspectives and trends that fractured a nation as well as a forward looking transformative outlook towards a shared deliberative reality."
"August 18, 2008","This paper, seeks to be a response for two questions; firstly to see if preemptive attacks on nuclear facilities of a non-nuclear weapon nation by another nation is permissible under current international law of use of force? And secondly, can a conventional military attack on a nuclear facility amount a nuclear attack, if it causes risks to human and environmental security and political and territorial integrity of the targeted state in a weight that one can expect from a nuclear attack? If the answer to the latter was positive, what would be the responsibility of international community and the Security Council as the principal organ of the United Nations for maintaining peace and security toward this threat or act of aggression?"
"August 18, 2008","In the course of the 'War on Terrorism' the United States has been permitted to use Shannon Airport, Ireland and Irish airspace for the purposes of refuelling, stop over, and fly over. Suspicion abounds that the United States has exercised these rights in relation to planes involved in 'extraordinary rendition' and, as a result, that Ireland is in breach of its obligation of non-refoulement under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Irish Government claims that it has received comprehensive and unequivocal Diplomatic Assurances from the United States that no persons have been, are being, or will be 'rendered' through Irish airspace and Shannon Airport and that these Assurances are sufficient to fulfill Ireland's Article 3 obligations, should they arise."
"August 17, 2008","Recently, Article 2 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was amended to allow military commanders to assert jurisdiction over any person ""accompanying the armed force"" and ""in a time of a declared war or a contingency operation"" - an expansive grant of jurisdiction which allows military commanders to subject civilians to the military justice system."
"August 15, 2008","This study demonstrates that Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) can be a useful tool to assess the relative efficiencies of water supply systems and to establish benchmarks to measure progress in the management of water resources. Frontier efficiency models measured the efficiency of water use in the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and the Gaza Strip). At the municipality level, sufficient data were available (1999-2002) to estimate efficiency and stability scores. The Gaza strip efficiency scores were considerably lower than those of the West Bank. Water losses were the major source of inefficiency. Palestinian policy makers should focus on rebuilding the infrastructure of the water networks, beginning with the most inefficient municipalities to minimize water losses."

"August 10, 2008","Force now being used in Iraq exceeds the limits imposed by both of the relevant statutes, the 2002 Joint Resolution and the 2001 AUMF.  Politically, both the Executive and Congress prefer the legal status quo to the alternative that the other would prefer."
"August 07, 2008","The United States and Iraq are about to conclude a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) designed to replace UN Security Council resolutions as the legal basis for a continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq.   But it appears the Iraqi Prime Minister and the Iraqi Parliament are divided on the desirability of a SOFA, the former favoring the agreement and the latter opposing it.   Because the United States has pushed very hard to complete an agreement, one possible scenario is that the Iraqi Parliament will refuse to ratify the SOFA.   What would happen if the Iraqi Prime Minister nonetheless signed the agreement, representing that his signature was sufficient to bind the state of Iraq?"
"August 07, 2008","This article proposes a process for the UN Security Council to follow when deciding whether to use military force to address an international crisis. The process would help the Security Council determine, ex ante, whether military action is necessary and justified, and, if so, how it can be applied with the least possible cost in lives and property."
"August 06, 2008","Since the inception of the 'War on Terrorism' the absolute prohibition on refoulement under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights has been the subject of intense criticism by some European states. The United Kingdom, in particular, has argued that the principle of non-refoulement under Article 3 (i.e. that a state may not transfer an individual (regardless of the danger they may pose) to any state where there is a ""real risk"" of subjection to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) is inappropriate when applied to suspected terrorists considered to pose a dangerous threat to the safety and welfare of the community as a whole. In addition, numerous European states have begun to deport individuals suspected of terrorist involvement to states with notorious reputations for ill-treatment on the basis of Diplomatic Assurances."
"August 06, 2008","The Immigration and Nationality Act (""INA"") , as it must, excludes a terrorist from receiving asylum. The substantive criteria, and the adjudicative procedures set forth under the INA for the identification of the undeserving terrorist inevitably exlude those who are neither terrorists nor otherwise undeserving. Such unintended consequences are perhaps unavoidable in any well-conceived statutory scheme. What is disconcerting is, however, the margin of the possible eroor in the application of this statutory scheme. Those who may be excluded by the application of these provisions are often not those who are supposed to be excluded as terrorists. Moreover, the existing scheme provides little help in screening out the real terrorists. The Article demonstrates these flaws and proposes some substantive and procedural modifications."
"August 04, 2008","Peace agreements form a crucial element of strategies to bring security from outside: they involve third-party mediators during the negotiation stage and often peacekeeping troops to guarantee the agreement at an implementation stage. Peace roundtables usually involve top politicians and military leaders, who negotiate, sign, and/or benefit from the agreement. What is usually and conspicuously absent from peace negotiations is broad-based participation by those who should benefit in the first place: citizens. More specifically, the local level of security provision and insecurity production is rarely taken into account. This paper reviews parts of the academic debate on power sharing and war termination, touching on some key findings by the main researchers working on the topic. The ambivalent African experience with Arend Lijphart's four main ingredients of consociational democracy (grand coalition, minority veto, proportional representation, group autonomy) is summarized."
"August 04, 2008","The article evaluates the proposal made by Heymann and Kayyem in their book Protecting Liberty in an Age of Terror to replace the practice of ethnic profiling by nationality-based profiling. It argues that in many circumstances this proposed alternative is not less offensive than ethnic profiling, especially when there is high correlation between ethnicity and nationality, and that at the same time it is does not prove to be an effective alternative in many other circumstances, especially in the context of immigration countries. Ultimately, the article proposes a shift in the focus of the debate on profiling from the controversy around the legitimate criteria for profiling to the context in which profiling is used and the kind of decisions to which it applies. The argument in this regard is that profiling is criticized also because it was used in the context of decisions with long-lasting effects on people's lives - for the purpose of completely denying people an entrance to a country or for detaining them (in the Korematsu example). Therefore, rather than focusing only on the question of the criteria used for profiling, it would be better also to ensure that profiling is used only with regard to enforcement decisions that do not have long-lasting effects on the lives of innocent people."
"August 01, 2008","The European Union considers conflict resolution as a cardinal objective of its foreign policy. It makes use of a number of policy instruments to promote conflict transformation through 'constructive engagement', which cover a range of sectors affecting conditions and incentives at the micro level. The EU has recognised the importance of engaging with civil society in situations of violent conflict, but needs to engage more with local civil society to make its policies more effective. This paper provides a conceptual framework and discussion to analyse which local civil society actors play a role in conflict and conflict transformation, through which activities they impact on conflicts and how, what determines their effectiveness, and finally how EU neighbourhood policies can enhance their constructive impact in peacefully transforming conflicts in its near abroad by engaging with civil society."

"July 25, 2008","This paper compares and contrasts South East Asian and European Union countries' perceptions of the priorities for anti money laundering (AML) and anti terrorist finance (ATF) in relation to three industries: security goods and services; the timber trade; and 'informal' value transfer and banking services. It might be expected that all countries would equally support each of these aspects of AML/ATF policies, without differentiating between the industries generating the proceeds. As this paper will show, however, historical experiences, contemporary political relations and patterns of trade shape countries' approaches, resulting in distinctive enthusiasms and reservations. In a nutshell, the EU points most strongly to products and services originating in Asia as posing AML/CTF risks, and locates primary responsibility for monitoring and control as falling within Asia - a projection of risk and responsibility that is reciprocated by Asian countries. Asian countries perceive a need for tighter control of dangerous products exported by the west, for example, small arms and light weapons, and of related money laundering circuits. Asian and European policy makers increasingly articulate concerns over illegal logging and related laundering, however European importers and their governments see responsibilities for this as falling primarily within Asia. Finally, the EU (like the US) perceives high levels of laundering risk in 'informal' value transfer/banking services, in which Asian-run businesses have a global competitive advantage. For the future, as the international balance of trade shifts, and as Asia increases its influence in international fora including those concerned with AML/CTF, so the region's policy preferences may be expected to carry more weight."
"July 25, 2008","In his September 2003 address to the United Nations general assembly, Secretary General Kofi Annan warned that the UN Charter's legal and institutional framework on the use of military force among states had come to a ""fork in the road."" He asked a ""high-level panel on threats, challenges and change"" to consider practical options for reform. Quite clearly, the secretary-general's initiative was a response to the combination of the United States' rhetoric of preventive war, its assertion that the UN was risking irrelevance in security matters, and the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. It thus seems obvious where the United States stands in the debate that Annan launched on ""whether it is possible to continue on the basis agreed upon, or whether radical changes are needed."" It may seem equally clear that Canada's answer is that the world must maintain the existing multilateral framework. In other words, it may seem that Canada and the United States are now headed down diverging legal and policy roads, with potentially serious implications for their ""special"" relationship. Indeed, it is tempting to see the fact that Canada chose not to support the US-led intervention in Iraq and the American displeasure with that decision as indicative of what is to come."
"July 25, 2008","The European Union faces unprecedented difficulties in its integration of the Western Balkans in terms of the requirements for change by countries in that region wishing to join. In order to meet this challenge, the EU's political conditionality has moved significantly beyond its demands made on the post-Communist entrants of 2004 and 2007. But its effort to bridge the gap between the ability or political will of Balkan countries to adapt to European modernisation and uncertainties about EU commitment created by ""enlargement fatigue"" among Member States is vulnerable to weak consensus on both sides. Accordingly, the dynamic behind further enlargement is not comparable with the historic drive that impelled the enlargement of 2004. At the same time, there are strong geopolitical arguments on grounds of stabilising the Balkans for going ahead with integrating the Western half of this region."
"July 25, 2008","This article provides a framework for negotiating meaning in Islam on questions of war and peace. It begins by presenting some representative and contrasting understandings of Islam, particularly as relates to militant Islam, and then suggests some ways in which negotiations of meaning can take place in this context. It argues that the varied experiences of those who act in the name of Islam and justify their actions according to the life of Mohammed and devotion to Allah require a new, and radical, framework, a framework that prioritises diversity and a decentralised ethic of understanding over homogenisation and hegemonisation and avoids post-colonial constructions of inevitable inferiority and weakness. Such a framework has the advantage of being more methodologically satisfying because it can better account for and deal with the diverse perspectives and complexities in the debate and better appreciate the political implications and undertones inherent in interpretation."
"July 24, 2008","This article examines two fields of geopolitical competition in the Black Sea region, in which an increasing EU involvement is increasingly challenging Russian interests. First, the EU's effort to diversify its energy sources through new transportation routes is meeting competition in the form of Russian-sponsored projects. The EU has realized the partial incompatibility of Russian and EU interests in this regard; however, the lack of cohesion within the EU prevents the formation of common external energy policies. Second, the EU is increasingly recognizing its interest in engaging with conflict resolution in the region. This also runs contrary to Russian strategy, which strives to maintain the status quo in the conflicts rather than working for solutions, in order to maintain Russian leverage over the South Caucasus and Moldova. In this field, the EU has yet to officially recognize its interest conflict with Russia. However, due to the intertwinement of the conflict resolution processes with the EU's deeper policy goals in the Black Sea region, namely the promotion of a stable, secure and democratic European neighborhood, the EU will likely find it increasingly difficult to pursue its key interests in the region, while simultaneously maintaining a passive stance towards Russian policies in the region."
"July 24, 2008","In recent years, the multilateral practice of peacekeeping and peace support operations has been growing as legitimate instrument to interrupt violence, strengthen security, and protect against gross human rights violations. Invented by the United Nations, peace operations have passed through a process of change that has given new features to multilateral security. Since the late 1980s, the number of UN-authorized peace operations has been growing. Also regional organisations have engaged themselves in an unprecedented number of peace support operations. Recently, the European Union has entered into the practice of peacekeeping, and put multilateralism at the centre of its presence in the world political system. This paper reviews political science knowledge on peace operations (especially, the legitimacy and efficacy issues), and examines the hypothesis of the appearance of minilateralism as the consequence of the engagement of regional organisations and actors, like the EU, in peace operations. The hypothesis is tested by comparing the data of the peace missions of three European organisations (EU, OSCE, and NATO) with those of the United Nations. The paper conclusion is that the European states are developing a preference for selective engagement (i.e. minilateralism) in peace operations, and the EU is capable of playing both as multilateral and minilateral security provider."
"July 22, 2008","We examine the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombing among Muslim publics in six predominantly Muslim countries that have experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. We make two contributions. First, we present a conceptual model, which has been lacking in the literature. Second, we consider attitudes towards two different targets of suicide bombings: civilians within the respondent’s country and Western military and political personnel in Iraq. We find that the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombings varies across countries and targets. Our findings therefore draw attention to the difficulties of making generalizations about Muslim countries, and the importance of distinguishing between targets of suicide bombings."
"July 22, 2008","The history of international law is, in large part, about the development of restraints on states' right to resort to force in dealing with external conflicts. Today, states may use force only in self-defense to an armed attack or with Security Council authorization. Even in these cases, states may use force only as a last resort, and then only if doing so will not disproportionately harm civilians, their property, or the natural environment. These rules restricting force are found in treaties (especially the United Nations Charter), customary international law, and the general principles of international law. In other words, the three primary sources of international law yield important rules restricting the use of force. The rules on use of force, like all international law rules, are binding on states for the same reason the law of any jurisdiction binds - because it is accepted as law by the community."
"July 19, 2008","Based on available data, successful excessive-force prosecutions against police officers in New York City typically have been limited to the most publicized cases of deadly force or torture. It is thus unsurprising that the routine, gratuitous use of force that accompanies arrests and street encounters typically goes entirely unpunished and often unrecognized. When excessive-force allegations come to the attention of prosecutors, institutional pressures (some structural, others informal) can work against successful prosecution. When a police officer is indicted on excessive-force charges, typically the officer waives a jury trial and proceeds before a judge as the trier of fact. In urban bench trials, judges have shown themselves to have complicated responses to police witnesses, responses that work to the advantage of police officers charged with crimes. The chapter examines the situation in New York City in the 1990s with respect to prosecution of police officers and considers how institutions that fail to address police violence reproduce all-too-familiar patterns of exclusion within the legal order. The chapter acknowledges the limitations of relying solely on criminal prosecution as a response to police brutality; a remedial system that emphasizes individual instances of past misconduct cannot get at the root of systemic racial and gender/sexuality bias. However, the chapter concludes that the symbolic and deterrent effects of the criminal law are needed to begin to repair the damage to communities whose experience of the legal system has offered no sense of justice or occasion for peace."
"July 18, 2008","The article addresses the issue of whether conduct in international peace operations is attributable to the troop contributing states or to the United Nations, taking the European Court of Human Rights  admissibility decision in the Behrami and Saramati cases as a point of reference. The Court concluded that conduct by UNMIK and KFOR troops in Kosovo is attributable to the United Nations. The article examines the content of the  ultimate authority and control  test that is applied by the Court, and argues that the Court should have taken a different approach. The Court's test is in the author's view difficult to reconcile with the International Law Commission's work on the responsibility of international organizations, with United Nations practice on responsibility for unlawful conduct in peace operations, and with the Court's own jurisprudence concerning attribution of conduct to the state. The author argues further that the Court's arguments are incomplete even if the Court's approach were to be considered correct. The article concludes by expressing concern that the Court's decision, when seen in connection with previous case law, in practice renders the European Convention on Human Rights irrelevant in international peace operations."
"July 18, 2008","The activities of Blackwater and other private contractors in Iraq have focused public attention on the post-Cold War trend towards outsourcing of military services.

"July 17, 2008","We introduce concepts and measures relating to inequality between identity groups. We define and discuss the concepts of Representational Inequality, Sequence Inequality and Group Inequality Comparison. Representational Inequality captures the extent to which an attribute is shared between members of distinct groups. Sequence Inequality captures the extent to which groups are ordered hierarchically. Group Inequality Comparison captures the extent of differences between groups-. The concepts have application in interpreting segregation, clustering and polarization in societies. There exists a mapping from familiar inequality measures to the measures we identify, making them empirically applicable."

"July 14, 2008","This paper enquires into whether economic sanctions are effective in destabilizing authoritarian rulers. We argue that this effect is mediated by the type of authoritarian regime against which sanctions are imposed. Thus, personalist regimes and monarchies, which are more dependent on aid and resource rents to maintain their patronage networks, are more likely to be affected by sanctions. In contrast, single-party and military regimes are able to maintain (and even increase) their tax revenues and to reallocate their expenditures and so increase their levels of cooptation. Data on sanction episodes, authoritarian rulers and regimes covering the period 1946-2000 have allowed us to test our hypotheses. To do so, duration models have been run, and the results confirm that personalist autocrats are more vulnerable to foreign pressure. Concretely, the analysis of the modes of exit reveals that sanctions increase the likelihood of an irregular change of ruler, such as a coup. Sanctions are basically ineffective when targeting single-party or military regimes."
"July 14, 2008","The House of Lords  ruling in Jones v Ministry of Interior Al-Mamlaka Al-Arabiya AS Saudiya (the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and others sets an important precedent in the field of international civil claims for torture. It was also the first to address in detail the ratio of the seminal judgment in Pinochet No. 3, a ruling that has given rise to much speculation as to the relationship between State immunity, jus cogens norms and human rights. This article explores the significance of the Jones case, and, in the light of that ruling, comments more generally upon the wider issue of the extent to which State immunity acts as a barrier to international legal actions for torture brought in domestic courts in both the civil and criminal spheres."

"July 09, 2008","The UN Committee against Torture considers the introduction of a distinct offence of torture in domestic law to be the most effective way of implementing Article 4 of the Convention against Torture. States parties which have introduced or are in the process of introducing a separately defined offence of torture have nonetheless frequently adopted definitions which are not entirely adequate in the light of the Convention. Problematic areas include  mental  torture, torture for the purpose of discrimination, the role of state agents in the practice of torture and exceptions which are different from the  lawful sanctions  exception provided for in the Convention itself. The case of Italy is a good illustration of the kind of obstacles which frequently arise when states are invited to introduce an ad hoc offence of torture. While maintaining that enacting a specific prohibition is not required by the Convention, the Italian Government has apparently accepted the idea that its introduction in Italian law would represent an improvement   without, in fact, doing much to achieve this result. As for the definitions of torture, the debate on the numerous bills providing for a specific offence of torture which have been tabled in the Italian Parliament during the last three parliamentary terms has focused on two main aspects. First, according to the majority of the members of Parliament (MP), in order to comply with the Constitutional principle of determinacy, the offence must be defined with reference to the conduct amounting to torture, i.e. to the type of act by which pain or suffering is inflicted on the victim. Some of the bills which define the act of torture do so in restrictive terms and are clearly not in conformity with Article 1 of the Convention. Second, opinions are divided with respect to the role of public officials (or other persons acting in an official capacity) in committing the crime of torture: while some MPs are in favour of introducing a reato proprio, i.e. a crime that only a public official can commit, others have proposed a common crime of torture. This, however, may be too similar to certain generic offences under Italian law that do not catch the essence of torture or insufficiently take into account its grave nature."
"July 09, 2008","Few juridical tasks are more distasteful than specifying the distinction between torture and  mere  cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Although the distinction itself may seem morally obtuse, it is a line, not between prohibited and permissible conduct, but between categories of prohibited conduct that are subject to distinct implementation regimes. The Torture Convention combines a narrow exposure of individual state officials to prosecutions in foreign courts for the international crime of torture with a broad state responsibility for the decent treatment of all detainees under all circumstances. To ignore or blur the distinction would not necessarily strengthen real accountability; to the contrary, allowing extraterritorial prosecutions for acts short of the torture threshold would unduly jeopardize agents of politically unpopular governments, would furnish a tool for political actors bent on undermining peaceful and respectful international relations, and would, paradoxically, risk producing a perverse downward pressure on the standards for detainee treatment."
"July 09, 2008","The old debate on the (Israeli) ticking bomb cases must be revisited in the light of the increasing threat by terrorist bombers and a recent German kidnapping case. Both cases may be combined as one  model case  to test whether the claim of a truly absolute prohibition of torture can really stand in extreme situations where the use of torture may be the only means to obtain the necessary information to prevent great(er) harm for innocents. Even in these situations the absolute prohibition against torture must not be relaxed ex ante and in abstracto   given the unequivocal situation in international law and the negative policy implications a flexible approach would have. However, this does not necessarily entail the individual investigator's criminal responsibility ex post and in concreto given the conflicting duties   to respect the (terrorist) suspect's human dignity and at the same time (actively) protect potential victims of this suspect's action   he has to face. A just solution to this dilemma can only be found by distinguishing between, on the one hand, the state and the individual level, and on the other hand, between (non-) justification (wrongfulness) of the act of torture and excuse (personal blameworthiness) of the torturer. Thus, the investigator may be excused, but his conduct not justified, since this would convert the torture into something lawful or even socially acceptable and thus undermine the absoluteness of the conduct rule not to torture. This result is developed in the last part of this article taking into account the relevant provisions of the Israeli and German Penal Codes and the ICC Statute (Part 4). Before the Israeli and German cases can be compared (Part 1), some clarifications as to the status and rationale of the international prohibition of torture must be made (Part 2) and a  model case , where preventive torture may be necessary should be considered (Part 3)."
"July 09, 2008","If conduct is consistent with the laws of war, may it nonetheless constitute crimes against humanity during an armed conflict? Crimes against humanity initially emerged during the World Wars, in order to extend the protection of the laws of war to a perpetrator's co-nationals. This new category initially required a nexus with international armed conflict, but is now an autonomous concept based on human rights law that criminalizes large-scale atrocities in both war and peacetime. Crimes against humanity committed in armed conflict continue to be shaped by the laws of war. There is substantial convergence between the normative core of ‘non-derogable’ human rights and the minimum humane treatment standards in the Geneva Law. However, there is considerable divergence with respect to combat operations where the Hague Law applies as lex specialis, displacing certain human rights norms. ICTY jurisprudence demonstrates some of the instinctive tensions inherent in reconciling human rights with armed conflict. A notable instance is the Gotovina case, in which the Trial Chamber held that the laws of war do not apply to ‘deportation’ qua crimes against humanity such that there is no distinction between forcible displacement of civilians in occupied territories as opposed to combat operations. The temptation to dilute the laws of war through reclassification of conduct as crimes against humanity should be resisted because it does not necessarily result in increased protection for civilians in times of armed conflict. Utopian jurisprudence that disregards humanitarian law's realistic code of conduct in the name of progress risks making the law irrelevant to military commanders."
"July 09, 2008","The current controversy surrounding the legality of torture can only be understood through an analysis of the distinction between justified necessity and excused necessity. Although there may be strong prudential reasons for international criminal courts to declare torture unlawful under any circumstance, this would not necessarily prevent a court from recognizing that an excuse may apply. However, the hallmark of the necessity excuse should not be understood, as it is in German law, as an exception that only applies when a defendant breaks the law to save someone close to him. Rather, the basic principle of the excuse ought to be that the impending harm so weighs on the conscience of the defendant that his autonomy is impermissibly infringed by the necessity of the situation. Given that the prospect of massive casualties might compel a police or military official to engage in torture, the relationship between the defendant and the potential victims is irrelevant. All that matters is that the defendant is torn between, on the one hand, a deontological commitment to treat all suspects humanely, and on the other, a consequentialist concern with the deaths of many innocent victims. Commentators have wrongly assumed that these consequentialist concerns are only relevant for justified necessity. But if a court finds that the pull of the latter is so strong that to resist it would require an act of extreme moral courage, the culpability of the defendant is negated and the defence of excused necessity could be applied."
"July 09, 2008","In the wake of the Second Lebanon conflict, the UN Human Rights Council established an independent body of experts to investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) perpetrated by Israeli forces. The Commission's report suffers from one serious and conspicuous flaw   the Commission was not charged with simultaneously considering Hezbollah's violations of the same body of law. In some instances, this one-sided focus was not only politically unbalanced, but substantively inadequate since a full understanding of Hezbollah's command structure, strategic objectives and military operations was essential in determining whether targets destroyed by Israel were legitimate military objectives and whether consequences for civilians were disproportionate to the military advantage gained. Be that as it may, the Commission's final report testified to the excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by Israeli forces and an overall lack of respect for the cardinal principles regulating the conduct of armed conflict. The Commission's findings are particularly disquieting, given the independent nature of the investigation and, ultimately, the compatibility of much of the Commission's legal reasoning with orthodox interpretations of IHL. The legal issues raised by the Inquiry are therefore of ongoing importance, most notably for the Israeli-appointed Winograd Committee."
"July 09, 2008","It has already been noted that the recent legal justifications for torture provided by Bush Administration officials contravene human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law as expressed in treaties and customary rules. However, the author provides a legal and policy analysis informed by military law to demonstrate that the use of torture or ill-treatment of detainees also contravenes the stated policy of the US military and is inconsistent with the basic principles of lawful warfare. More importantly, torture and the ill-treatment of prisoners are both ineffective as an interrogation tool and also hamper military effectiveness by destroying discipline. These reasons, in addition to the obvious moral considerations, demonstrate why modern armies have consistently adhered to customary and treaty rules prohibiting torture and the ill-treatment of prisoners. The author concludes that the basic principles of warfare demand that this prohibition constitutes a bright-line rule that applies to all prisoners regardless of legal status."
"July 09, 2008","Today's definition of torture is radically different from torture as understood in medieval times. The jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunals has furthered our understanding of  modern torture  as it confronts unique contemporary challenges: non-state and even private actors committing seemingly random acts of violence, often unconnected to their old venues: criminal proceedings, corporal punishment and forced confessions. In the first part the author systematizes the various elements of torture (from the actus reus, to the requisite mens rea, to cumulative convictions and sentencing) under international criminal law. In part two the author reviews two developments in the definition of torture. While the article's analysis supports the expansion of the list of prohibited purposes (because torture is a crime which grossly violates the autonomy of human beings), the author criticizes the deletion of the official sanction requirement, because in his view, international criminal justice deals not with torture as a discrete crime, but rather with torture as a war crime and crime against humanity."
"July 09, 2008","The author discusses a decision handed down in 2007 by an Italian military court concerning the firing by Italian troops on an Iraqi ambulance in 2004, at Nassiriyah, resulting in the killing of four civilians. The court held that the action was covered by the defence of putative  special military necessity  and consequently acquitted the two defendants. The author argues that the accurate basis on which to exclude criminal culpability, both under Italian law and international criminal law, could be the excuse of putative self-defence. He also raises the issue of whether in that case the servicemen behaved negligently in acting in the belief that the ambulance was likely to be a car-bomb. The author then discusses the question of compensation to civilians for violations of international humanitarian law, regardless of whether such violations entail the criminal liability of the perpetrators."
"July 09, 2008","How can deontologists reconcile the stringency of the moral prohibition on torture with the recognition that it may sometimes be the only means to prevent catastrophe? This article proposes a conception of deontology that allows for the resolution of this dilemma. Casting deontology in terms of the distinction between categorical and conditional obligations, we articulate a theoretical distinction between principles and exceptions. Torture can never be permitted or authorized by a rule or principle. Whenever it is justifiably performed it is performed under urgent and exceptional circumstances. On this basis the practical necessity of torture may be acknowledged, while the categorical nature of the prohibition on torture is maintained. This explains how torture might be categorically prohibited by international law, yet at the same time be subject to a defence of necessity or duress under international criminal law."
"July 09, 2008","I revisit Anne E. Sartori's article, 'The Might of the Pen: A Reputational Theory of Communication In International Disputes' (International Organization, Winter 2002) and reanalyze her game-theoretic model of pre-crisis diplomatic communication.  I show that there exists another equilibrium to the game, which fully reveals types.  The new equilibrium offers modifications to her thesis on diplomatic communication.  Namely, diplomatic communication is more effective than the original article suggests in eliminating the relevant uncertainty that would otherwise cause the risk-return trade-off.  Consequently, diplomatic communication when it is effective helps reduce the risk of war in subsequent crises.  Moreover, effective diplomacy is generally attainable for any punishment duration including temporary and indefinite punishment schemes.  These results refine the logic of pre-crisis diplomatic communication and hence redefine the significance of diplomacy as an effective statecraft instrument to attain foreign policy goals."
"July 09, 2008","Torture is prohibited by a certain number of international instruments   a demonstration of the willingness of the international community to outlaw torture in all its manifestations. Yet this set of legal rules seems to have generated confusion as regards the definition of torture. One controversial aspect concerns the requirement that for torture proper to be committed, it must be carried out by state officials or with their involvement. The author argues that the notion of torture depends upon the particular context in which it is used. In the field of international criminal law, the notion of torture as a crime per se, i.e. as a crime which is punishable as such, even if perpetrated sporadically and regardless of whether it is perpetrated in time of peace or war, requires the involvement of a state official. This is so because it is necessary not to  trivialize  the interference of the international community into the realm of criminal law by imposing the criminalization of every single instance of wicked conduct of an entirely private nature. By contrast, the requirement of state official is not needed anymore for torture as a war crime or a crime against humanity. In both cases the quid pluris that turns the infliction of severe pain and suffering into a crime of international concern is the contextual element, i.e. the particular context of violence surrounding the criminal act, coupled with the need to protect the mental and physical integrity of human beings when they are systematically disregarded by deviant behaviours, or when a situation of armed conflict put them at great risk. On the other hand, the notion of torture is wider in non-criminal law contexts. Under human rights treaties, a state can be held responsible for every single instance of torture, including pain and suffering inflicted by a private individual against another private individual under his custody. The reason is that under such treaties states are obliged not only not to violate themselves the protected rights, but also to act as their ultimate defenders when the full enjoyment of those rights is jeopardized by private individuals. The legal definition of torture is a sort of chameleon that   while always embracing the notion that the infliction of acute pain and suffering upon a person under the control of another is required   by necessity changes the colour of its skin as far as additional elements are concerned, depending on the context in which it is situated."
"July 09, 2008","On 17 December 2007 the Military Commission convened to try Salim Ahmed Hamdan ruled that, as part of Hamdan's challenge to its jurisdiction, Article 5 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW) required the Commission to entertain Hamdan's claims of entitlement to prisoner of war status. The Commission rejected those claims and found Hamdan to be an unlawful combatant subject to its jurisdiction two days later. The author concludes that the Commission's decision to grant an Article 5 status determination was consistent with international humanitarian law. He further argues, however, that the Commission's decisions to conduct the status determination and to consider all-claimed prisoner of war categories under the GPW were inconsistent with the Military Commission Act, specifically its definition of lawful and unlawful combatants and, hence, inconsistent with the US national law governing the Commission."

"July 08, 2008","In the judgment concerning the Genocide Convention, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) holds that different tests could be applied in order to determine (i) the degree of a state's involvement in an armed conflict on another state's territory that is required for the conflict to be characterized as international and (ii) the degree of a state's involvement that is required for that state to be held responsible for a specific act that occurred in the course of the conflict. This article discusses this holding. In particular, it analyses whether by excluding attribution to the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the acts of genocide committed by the Bosnian Serb Army (VRS), the ICJ has precluded the possibility of considering the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina as an international armed conflict."
"July 08, 2008","On the face of it the 1948 Convention on Genocide appears to be a treaty that on the one hand obliges contracting states to criminalize and punish genocide in their domestic legal systems and, on the other, arranges for interstate judicial cooperation for the repression of genocide. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in the Bosnia v. Serbia judgment, has instead held that the Convention, in addition to providing for the criminal liability of individuals, also imposes on contracting states as international subjects a set of obligations (to refrain from engaging in genocide, to prevent and punish the crime, and also to refrain for all those categories of conduct enumerated in Article III: conspiracy, incitement, attempt, complicity). This approach raises two questions: (i) is it warranted so to broaden states' responsibility? (ii) when applying such Article III categories to state responsibility, should an international court such as the ICJ that pronounces on interstate disputes rely upon criminal law categories to establish whether a state incurs responsibility for conspiracy, complicity, and so on? Or should it instead forge autonomous legal categories better suited to state responsibility? The author sets forth doubts about whether it is appropriate to transpose criminal law categories to the corpus of international law of state responsibility. In particular, his misgivings relate to the category of  state complicity in genocide  as set out by the Court: once the Court decided to transplant this criminal law category to state responsibility, arguably it should have relied upon the rigorous concept of complicity, as derived by international criminal courts from case law and the relevant practice of states, rather than apply a notion that finds no basis in international criminal law, in comparative criminal law or in state practice."
"July 08, 2008","I study matrical methodology for the impact assessment of the policy programmes on social welfare in particular their procedures for aggregation and synthesis of detailed and contradicting experts' assessments of specific impacts into policy relevant conclusions. This is illustrated by the territorial impact assessment (TIA) of Slovene Energy Programme (SEP, 2004) on the components of spatial cohesion (SC; identity, quality, efficiency; as proposed by ESPON, 2005). The result is intriguing: SEP's impact on SC' components is weak to very weak in spite of the fact that its impact on spatial subsystems (socio-cultural, physical, economic) are moderate to strong. Reasons and implications of this dichotomy are studied here from the theoretical, methodological and practical aspect of consideration."
"July 08, 2008","This judgment is one of the most important contributions in recent years by a national court to the development of the laws governing armed conflicts between states and non-state actors taking place outside of the territory of the state involved. However, some contentious issues should not be passed over in silence. The Israeli Court applied the laws of international armed conflict to any case of armed conflict that crosses borders of the state even if the conflict does not involve belligerent occupation, without, however, providing any authority or explanation for this expansion of the class of international armed conflict. Furthermore, the Court rejected the Government's argument that a third category of  unlawful combatants  exists under international law, but its analysis on the issue does not enable the reader to fully understand the substantive considerations leading to the Court's conclusion. Although the Court's reference to academic literature is welcome, it cannot replace an assessment of the sources and rules of international law. Finally, the Court set out various requirements restricting the Israeli government's attacks on terrorists taking direct part in hostilities. These requirements, however, go beyond what is commonly considered to be mandated under the laws of international armed conflict: it is difficult to find support for them in state practice or in less recent academic literature interpreting that body of law."
"July 07, 2008","The geographical strategies of transnational corporations have received extensive attention from economic geographers. A particularly important line of study has focused upon the diverse national institutions that create geographically heterogeneous cultures of work. Yet, none of these studies place questions about how global firms act as  cultural entrepreneurs  at the centre of their analysis. This article, therefore, uses the case of transnational law firms to extend theoretical debates about the geographies of learning and best practice through new micro-scale consideration of the way managers in TNCs act as cultural entrepreneurs, driving change in institutionalized cultures of work through strategies that alter the cognitive frames of workers. Drawing primarily on data from interviews, the article reveals how the strategies used by influential partners in transnational law firms to drive changes in cultures of work do not lead to forms of global strong convergence in practice, but converging divergences as cultures change in subtle, often unpredicted ways. It is argued that economic geographers need to pay more attention to the mechanisms of such changes in culture, and the processes of change in national business systems more widely, so as not only to contribute to debates about corporate culture but also the varieties of capitalism."
"July 07, 2008","The new architecture for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons proposed here is a mandatory regime under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, building upon the current consensual regime, but remedying its deficiencies. This article examines the operation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in relation to current nuclear policy dynamics, explaining why the treaty regime has become increasingly inadequate to meet the proliferation challenge, and even counter-productive. The recent confrontations over nuclear policy with Iran, Saddam Hussein's Iraq and North Korea are drawn upon as illustrations and support for the new architecture's foundation - a Security Council Resolution declaring nuclear weapons proliferation, whether generated by states or non-state actors, a threat to the peace. The new architecture, while integrating key elements of the present non-proliferation framework, would be prescriptive, not merely reactive and ad hoc, the difference arising from its basis in a statement of principle under Chapter VII of the Charter. The article explains how this would engage a design similar to post 9/11 anti-terrorism innovation in the Security Council to achieve a more promising dimension of deterrence, political legitimacy and effectiveness in negotiation of non-proliferation. The new architecture includes the so-called  targeted sanctions , a new tool already proven meritorious for anti-terrorism and counter-proliferation efforts. In conclusion, the article evaluates evidence demonstrating that the necessary political will is available to achieve the proposed new architecture and frames the essential policy choice."
"July 07, 2008","This article focuses on the question of whether Ireland can be relegated to the slow lane of a two-speed Europe if it maintains its opposition to the Lisbon Treaty reforms. It notes the legal impossibility of expulsion of Ireland from the EU but posits the possibility of (a) the use of the enhanced cooperation procedure (supplemented by other measures); (b) cooperation outside the framework of the EU in either a maximalist or minimalist manner; and (c) Ireland's voluntarily leaving the EU as possible methods for other European states to proceed with integration leaving Ireland behind. The conclusion is reached that if Ireland is not left behind, this will be a political decision of the other member states taken because they lack the political will (or domestic political support) to proceed without Ireland. It will not be an option the other member states find themselves legally forced to accept."
"July 07, 2008","Democracies have two basic choices for managing ethnic, national, and religious diversity. They may seek to construct a single all-embracing public identity through  integration  or try to accommodate dual or multiple public identities through  consociation.  These are the two dominant, broad-based prescriptions that are offered for addressing the conflict in Iraq. In this article, we argue that Iraq's new Constitution, ratified in 2005, reflects a  liberal  form of consociation that accommodates Iraq's democratically mobilized communities. We examine in detail the Constitution's provisions for both self-government and for shared government, and argue that these provisions represent a reasonable way forward for all of Iraq's citizens and peoples. The Constitution is defended against integrationist criticisms."
"July 07, 2008","This article puts forward an argument for a particular approach to the interpretation of the definition of non-international armed conflict in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Focusing on the meaning of Article 8(2)(f), it is contended that this provision possesses a threshold of an application equivalent to that of Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. In supporting this position, the first half of the article analyses the travaux preparatoires of the Rome Statute. Here relevant clauses relating to non-international armed conflict are analysed in order to highlight the threshold of application intended by their drafters. Following on from the travaux preparatoires of the Rome Statute, the second half of the article puts forward an interpretation of the threshold contained in Article 8(2)(f) as one applicable to all situations of non-international armed conflict subject to the court's jurisdiction. Drawing, among other things, on the conventional usage of the term  armed conflict not of an international character  and the customary status of non-international armed conflict provisions in the Rome Statute, an argument is advanced for an understanding of the threshold contained in Article 8(2)(f) as the one identical to that of common Article 3."
"July 07, 2008","This article examines the issue of authorisation to use of lethal force under a UN Security Council Chapter VII  all necessary means  resolution. Because UN-mandated or endorsed forces are regularly confronted by complex operational environments of mixed - often ambiguous - legal nature, it is essential that both the international and domestic legal implications and consequences of the use of lethal force are considered when planning and executing such operations. This is important for a number of reasons - not least among them being the legal protections and certainties that individual UN force members are entitled to expect are correctly reflected in their Rules of Engagement (RoE). Through an examination of the scope of SC Chapter VII powers generally - with particular emphasis on the human rights and IHL dimensions of the use of lethal force - the analysis arrives at the conclusion that there are two  use of force paradigms  governing UN Chapter VII  all necessary means  mandates. The first is the  law enforcement  paradigm, which essentially countenances the use of lethal force within the limitations of self-defence. The second is the  armed conflict  paradigm, where use of lethal force is permitted in wider circumstances. From this point, the article examines which paradigm is at play in a number of specific SC Chapter VII  all necessary means  mandates, noting that the default position appears to be the law enforcement paradigm. The analysis then concludes by arguing that, for individual UN force members, the consequences and implications of this characterisation are ultimately a domestic legal issue, using one particular domestic legal jurisdiction - Australia - as an example."
"July 07, 2008","The UN Charter envisaged a centralised system of collective security in which the UN Security Council would have readily available forces of its own for the purpose of taking military enforcement action under its own authority and control. These forces were never created and the Security Council has had to rely heavily upon authorising willing coalitions of states to take action on its behalf. Although such an approach to military enforcement action is legally permissible, it gives rise to a series of consequences of a legal, military and political nature that call into question the extent to which it provides the Council with an effective means of exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. This article considers these consequences of the  coalition of the willing  approach to military enforcement action, and seeks to show that its utility will vary from one situation to another. Although difficulties can arise from operations being subjected to insufficient levels of ultimate legal oversight by the Security Council, or through military operational problems, the limitations of the  coalition of the willing  as an effective tool of the Council are likely to lie primarily in the political sphere."
"July 04, 2008","This article undertakes a critical reading of the arguments used at the bench and the bar in the 2004 ICJ Wall advisory opinion. The Wall case included an unprecedented number of State and non-State participants and it is therefore a valuable site in which to explore the parameters and limits of legal speech. What argumentative strategies were employed at the Peace Palace? How did different participants present the relationship between law and politics? In particular, because the example of Palestine can be seen as a challenge to the post-colonial order, how did Third World States employ the language of international law in support of Palestinian self-determination? It is shown that although international legal speech is highly restrictive, many Third World States are willing to challenge its boundaries through a deep-set faith in the dividends of legal argumentation."

"July 04, 2008","Spread of market economy and promotion of democracy are twin components of globalization. Both are generally positive phenomena that are taken by many to be something as obvious as God, motherhood and apple-pie. However, there is too much naivety and hypocrisy, especially in the process of promotion of democracy. In the case of societies that lack elementary preconditions for the introduction of democracy, the remedy may be worse than the illness. The end of the Cold War did not end the attempts to use concepts, such as democracy and human rights, as ideological tools to undermine other States. Attempts to change domestic social and political systems, especially those of great powers or their allies and neighbours, may lead to a new era of great power confrontation that would be especially dangerous because of common threats such as terrorism, spread of weapons of mass destruction, environmental crisis and so on."
"July 02, 2008","Many predicted that the strength of the Communist Party in Russia would wane as the elderly pensioners who disproportionately supported the party died off. Contrary to this prediction, the findings of our analysis indicate that voters who reached retirement age during the past decade were even more supportive of the communists than the cohort of pensioners who preceded them. We believe this occurred because it was workers approaching retirement, not pensioners per se, who were disproportionately injured by the transition to a more market-oriented economy. Like pensioners they lost savings, but in many cases they also lost their jobs. They also had little opportunity to learn the new skills that the Russian economy increasingly calls for. There is as yet no indication that the communists have begun to die out"
"July 02, 2008","The 'War on Terror' has prompted a great deal of discussion about the use of torture as a means of extracting information from those suspected of having perpetrated past acts of violence or planning future ones. Despite the years that have passed since the attacks of September 11, 2001, for both citizens and government officials there is still a strong tension between the competing emotions of anger, revenge, and desperation; it seems increasingly difficult to adhere to international norms governing a nation's moral and legal obligations to protect its citizens from grave danger while continuing to support individual freedoms. Among the more difficult questions to emerge from those that were far-fetched (if not unthinkable) just a few decades ago is how to handle the so-called ticking-bomb scenario. As terror organizations grow in size and complexity, uncovering terrorist plans by interrogating a group member has become critical, and the need to gather intelligence in order to save lives increasingly urgent."
"July 01, 2008","There has been a renewed emphasis in political science in the role of institutions in shaping political outcomes. This emphasis has led many scholars to the tougher question of how institutions, so prized for their durability and predictability, do in fact undergo fundamental transformations."
"July 01, 2008","In important conflicts such as wars and labor-management disputes, people typically rely on the judgment of experts to predict the decisions that will be made. We compared the accuracy of 106 forecasts by experts and 169 forecasts by novices about eight real conflicts. The forecasts of experts who used their unaided judgment were little better than those of novices. Moreover, neither group's forecasts were much more accurate than simply guessing. The forecasts of experienced experts were no more accurate than the forecasts of those with less experience. The experts were nevertheless confident in the accuracy of their forecasts. Speculating that consideration of the relative frequency of decisions across similar conflicts might improve accuracy, we obtained 89 sets of frequencies from novices instructed to assume there were 100 similar situations. Forecasts based on the frequencies were no more accurate than 96 forecasts from novices asked to pick the single most likely decision. We conclude that expert judgment should not be used for predicting decisions that people will make in conflicts. When decision makers ask experts for their opinions, they are likely to overlook other, more useful, approaches."
"June 30, 2008","According to the standard wisdom in international relations, authoritarian states hold an advantage over democratic states because they can act more quickly and decisively. Yet over the last several centuries, every extended rivalry between an authoritarian state and a liberal one has been won by the liberal state: the Dutch revolt against Spain (late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries); the 125-year rivalry between England and France (1689-1815); the Anglo-French-American rivalry with Germany (late nineteenth through mid-twentieth century); and the American/Allied rivalry with the Soviet Union after World War II."
"June 30, 2008","This paper examines the use of the rule of law at the international level as a tool - and its application to those who wield it - with a particular emphasis on UN operations in Asia, notably Timor-Leste (East Timor) and Afghanistan. Section one examines the ways in which the rule of law has been used to stabilize conflict zones, focusing on the activities of the UN Security Council from the mid-1990s onwards and in particular on Timor-Leste. Section two considers the extent to which the rule of law has constrained the decisions and actions of the Council, focusing on accountability issues and the apparent compromise of these principles in Afghanistan. A concluding section will consider what light (if any) these operations shed on larger questions raised by the book, such as whether there are discernibly 'Western' or 'Asian' approaches to the role law plays in times of crisis. Of particular interest is the extent to which the United Nations can be said to reflect Western values, as is frequently alleged. A tentative conclusion is that there may be some rhetorical merit to this claim: Western states do largely set the agenda for the human rights framework that is commonly used to judge state actions. Nevertheless, the United Nations and the international system wield executive authority so infrequently and inconstantly that broad conclusions are not yet possible. More interesting, for the purposes of this book, is the manner in which internationally-administered 'emergency' powers demonstrate the willingness of even established democracies to invoke the rule of law instrumentally, as a tool to provide stability - and thus implicitly to compromise rule of law principles in the name of security."
"June 30, 2008","Why do terrorists terrorize? Many explanations have been posited to answer this question. A common view, particularly in the popular press, is that terrorism and terrorists are irrational. A recent New York Times editorial attributed the violence experienced in Northern Ireland to 'hard-bitten loyalties and single minded devotion' which 'attracts psychopathic people' (New York Times, August 18, 1998: A23). Livingston (1978: 224-239) concurs that terrorists suffer from irrationalities and potentially even psychiatric illnesses. While such a view would make a rational account of terrorist activity seemingly impossible, in this paper, we argue that such an account is both possible and useful. Even in the event that terrorists suffer from such 'irrationalities,' a number of scholars have commented on the goal-directedness of those undertaking such terrorist campaigns. And insofar as the pursuit of such goals is relevant, the kernel of a rational choice understanding of terrorism is possible."
"June 26, 2008","The European Union considers conflict resolution as a cardinal objective of its foreign policy. It makes use of a number of policy instruments to promote conflict transformation through 'constructive engagement', which cover a range of sectors affecting conditions and incentives at the micro level. The EU has recognised the importance of engaging with civil society in situations of violent conflict, but needs to engage more with local civil society to make its policies more effective. This briefing aims to aid the understanding of the role of civil society organisations in situations of violent conflict, and the potential role of EU policies in enhancing CSOs' conflict transformation efforts."

Others, who opposed the militants have also appeared in the political battlements. Comparing the leadership strategies, tactics and styles employed by these leaders to conventional leadership thoughts gives us patterns to learn and emulate. In a course covering 300 slides, this presentation goes through the gamut of militancy, terrorism, counter-terrorism, communication, leadership and lessons we can learn from the past to meet today's global challenges."
"June 25, 2008","In September 1992 French voters in a national referendum approved the Maastrict Treaty, which instituted several provisions for closer European integration including creation of the Eurozone. This paper analyzes political and economic forces that affected French voters, and the links between the progress of European integration and changes in redistributive spending. Conventional wisdom ascribes the persistence of the Common Agricultural Program subsidies to the political power of farmers, although direct evidence of this has been sparse. The statistical analysis here finds that support for European integration is weaker, other things equal, in areas where farmers were most affected by the MacSharry reforms, which reduced some support  prices and began the process of ""decoupling"" agricultural subsidies from production. Results also show previous support for European integration and pro-European politicians are correlated with tronger support for ratification, as are higher incomes and higher proportions of non-natives. The results are consistent with the view that European integration provides voters and taxpayers with a way to limit the influence of interest groups by shifting decisionmaking from a national to a supranational arena."
"June 25, 2008","In the midst of a major U.S. military effort in Iraq and the Middle East, economists should be able to assess the relationship between U.S. troops and growth. The necessity of military force in providing security for nation-building is a common assumption among policymakers and international affairs experts, but there has never been an econometric analysis of the impact of troops on growth.  We use a newly constructed disaggregated dataset on the deployment of U.S. troops over the years 1950-2000, and discover a positive relationship with host country economic growth, robust to multiple control variables."
"June 24, 2008","The author argues that the trials of Iraq's previous government before the Iraqi Special Tribunal ('IST') should be read as a particular kind of political trial: a successor trial of a prior regime, in which the political contestation revolves around the legitimation of the new order, and the delegitimation of the old. He contends that although the prevailing discourse of 'international justice' tends to deny or repress the constitutive politics of successor trials, these political tensions invariably re-emerge. The author considers evidence from a field study of Iraqi attitudes towards transitional justice, and reviews the historical and political circumstances that have shaped the creation of the IST. He concludes that the IST is afflicted by many of the same kinds of difficulties that have plagued the US invasion and occupation: international hostility, dubious legality, Iraqi ambivalence and the taint of power politics."
"June 23, 2008","This paper presents a theoretical model of interaction between a government and ordinary people over the issue of public support for war. I assume that interests of the government are not perfectly aligned with those of citizens, but public support is important for the success of war. The government can send, through mass media, signals to ordinary people, in order to secure public support for military actions. I find that higher costs of influencing media make the war less likely and, conditional on its happening, less costly. There is also a positive effect of uncertainty about the costs of war on public support, but it matters only if media are easy to influence for the government. Empirical evidence from Russian data on public opinion about Chechen conflict is consistent with theoretical predictions."
"June 23, 2008","The new architecture for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons proposed here is a mandatory regime under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, building upon the current consensual regime, but remedying its deficiencies. This article examines the operation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in relation to current nuclear policy dynamics, explaining why the treaty regime has become increasingly inadequate to meet the proliferation challenge, and even counter-productive. The recent confrontations over nuclear policy with Iran, Saddam Hussein's Iraq and North Korea are drawn upon as illustrations and support for the new architecture's foundation - a Security Council Resolution declaring nuclear weapons proliferation, whether generated by states or non-state actors, a threat to the peace. The new architecture, while integrating key elements of the present non-proliferation framework, would be prescriptive, not merely reactive and ad hoc, the difference arising from its basis in a statement of principle under Chapter VII of the Charter. The article explains how this would engage a design similar to post 9/11 anti-terrorism innovation in the Security Council to achieve a more promising dimension of deterrence, political legitimacy and effectiveness in negotiation of non-proliferation. The new architecture includes the so-called 'targeted sanctions,' a new tool already proven meritorious for anti-terrorism and counter-proliferation efforts. In conclusion, the article evaluates evidence demonstrating that the necessary political will is available to achieve the proposed new architecture and frames the essential policy choice."
"June 22, 2008","Recent constitutional developments relative to the war on terror raise critical questions concerning civil-military relationships in Anglo-American legal history dating back to the seventeenth century. Even before American independence was declared, leaders of the patriot cause recognized the need to respect property rights and related individual liberties while conducting war against a determined, combat-hardened army operating on American territory. At the same time a long-standing tradition of distrust and outright fear of the coercive power of standing armies led to the creation of a watchdog committee of Congress designed to serve directly at military headquarters and to play a major role in strategic planning, logistics operations, and liaison between the Continental Congress and its army commanders. Forcible seizure of private property was curtailed through military discipline as well as by the institution of formal evaluation procedures in state civil courts. Through the Revolutionary War there was continuing tension between respect for civilian rights and property on one hand, and, on the other hand, there was a pressing necessity for mobilizing services and materiel to meet the emergency needs of American armies."
"June 21, 2008","In the face of terrorism, human rights law's requirement that states ""respect and ensure"" rights necessitates that states take active steps to safeguard their populations from violent attack, but in so doing do not violate rights. Security experts usually emphasize the aspect of ensuring rights while human rights advocates largely focus on respecting rights. The trick, which neither side in the debate has adequately referenced, is that states have to do both at the same time.  In contrast to these largely one-sided approaches, adopting a radical universalist stance, this Article argues that both contemporary human rights and security discourses on terrorism must be broadened and renewed. This renewal must be informed by the understanding that international human rights law protects the individual both from terrorism and the excesses of counter-terrorism, like torture. To develop this thesis, the Article explores the philosophical overlap between both terrorism and torture and their normative prohibitions. By postulating new discourses around the paradigm of terror/torture, it begins the project of creating a new human rights approach to terrorism."
"June 20, 2008","We provide an overview of empirical evidence on the determinants of terrorism, in particular focusing on the origins and targets of transnational terrorism.We also assemble several broad theoretical families that relate terrorism to, e.g., economic, political and institutional and demographic factors. We provide a critical discussion of the existing empirical evidence and refer to a number of areas of future research before describing some modest policy implications."
"June 19, 2008","Drawing on research in Northern Ireland into the process of release under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, this article explores the identification and classification of risk in relation to prisoners released early under the Sentences (NI) Act. The main argument is that conflict, post-conflict and transitional conditions expose more starkly the political underpinnings of risk-management strategy and the article demonstrates the particular variant of Politicized Risk Assessment (PRA) recently used in the release of prisoners in Northern Ireland."
"June 18, 2008","Data on rainfall patterns only weakly corroborate the claim that climate change explains the Darfur conflict that began in 2003 and has claimed more than 200,000 lives and displaced more than two million persons. Rainfall in Darfur did not decline significantly in the years prior to the eruption of major conflict in 2003; rainfall exhibited a flat trend in the thirty-years preceding the conflict (1972-2002). The rainfall evidence suggests instead a break around 1971.   Rainfall is basically stationary over the pre- and post-1971 sub-periods. The break is larger for the more northerly rainfall stations, and is less noticeable for En Nahud. Rainfall in Darfur did indeed decline, but the decline happened over 30 years before the conflict erupted. Preliminary analysis suggests little merit to the proposition that a structural break several decades earlier is a reasonable predictor of the outbreak of large-scale civil conflict in Africa."
"June 18, 2008","This is a game-theoretic analysis of the link between regime type and international conflict. The democratic electorate can credibly punish the leader for bad conflict outcomes, whereas the autocratic selectorate cannot. For the fear of being thrown out of office, democratic leaders are (i) more selective about the wars they initiate and (ii) on average win more of the wars they start. Foreign policy behaviour is found to display strategic complementarities. The likelihood of interstate war, therefore, is lowest in the democratic dyad (pair), highest in the autocratic dyad with the mixed dyad in between. The results are consistent with empirical findings."
"June 18, 2008","This paper examines the failure of the U.N.'s policy of deterrence in Iraq between 1991 and the U.S. invasion in 2003. Specifically, how the basic tenets of U.N. Resolution 687- consisting of sanctions and weapons inspections - failed to accomplish their objectives and arguably contributed to the U.S. invasion."
"June 16, 2008","This report provides and analyzes the first comprehensive time series data on U.S. troop deployments by year and country, from 1950 to 2005, including the full dataset. On average, 23 percent of all U.S. servicemen were stationed on foreign soil during 1950-2005. Roughly 386,000 troops were stationed overseas in 2005 compared to an average of 535,540 during 1950-2000. Deployments have ranged from a high of 1,082,777 troops in 1968 to a low of 206,002 in 1999. There were 118.82 million U.S. military billets during 1950-2000 (with ""billet"" defined as one serviceman for one year). Of that total, 27.3 million billets were overseas assignments. Since 1950, 54 countries have hosted at least 1,000 American troops."
"June 16, 2008","Liberal theorists have long held that the value of trade lost due to military conflict will lead states to avoid such conflict with their trading partners. Previous research has found support for this line of argument, but has focused on state behavior rather than the attitudes of those actually engaged in trade. At the individual level, however, it is not obvious that trade actually influences attitudes on security issues in the way liberals argue. Economic interests are rarely considered in research on assessments of political-military threats. Moreover, because trade creates domestic losers as well as winners, it might actually increase threat perception among those whom it negatively affects. This paper tests these arguments in the case of American trade with China using data from both a survey of the general public and roll-call voting in the House of Representatives. As liberals expect, we find evidence that trade indeed influences American attitudes toward China. However, there are substantial differences among individual survey respondents based on whether their income can be expected to rise or fall as the trading relationship grows. The winners have more positive attitudes toward China and express less support for aggressive foreign policies toward the country than do the losers. Aggregate differences along these same dimensions among their constituents also influence roll-call voting in the House of Representatives."
"June 13, 2008","As many as 300,000 children serve as soldiers in conflicts in 33 countries. In many cases, these children are forced into service. This article recommends strategies the international community, including state actors, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations, can implement to reduce the number of child soldiers participating in armed conflicts and reintegrate former child soldiers into their societies."
"June 12, 2008","International recognition of Kosovo's independence and newfound statehood may have come at a high price. During the past eight years of talks and negotiations on Kosovo's final status, a great deal of consideration was given to regional, continental, and international concerns. Unfortunately, not nearly as much deliberation went into providing for a functional, stable, and democratic Kosovar constitution and state. As Kosovo now asserts itself as the newest member of the international community, the consequence of the internationally led process, which resulted in the development and acceptance of the Ahtisaari plan, may well be paralysis and destabilization of Kosovo's new constitution and state."
"June 12, 2008","On October 17, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the United States Military Commissions Act of 2006, responding to the Supreme Court's holding in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. Courts will soon consider whether the MCA violates parts of the Constitution, including the First Amendment. The purpose of this article is to examine whether the MCA's material support provisions, allowing the government to try persons suspected of having provided material support to terrorists in military commissions, violate First Amendment free speech rights. This article argues that the government might avoid First Amendment challenges to the MCA by making clear distinctions between support for lawful activities not related to terrorist acts and support for unlawful, terrorist activities in the material support definitions. By narrowing the definitions of material support, the government would allow for the prosecution of dangerous forms of support for terrorists while not violating citizens' and residents' First Amendment rights of association and speech in pursuit of humanitarian activities."
"June 10, 2008","Why do some civil wars terminate soon, with victory of one party over the other? What determines if the winner is the incumbent or the rebel group? Why do other conflicts last longer? We propose a simple model in which the power of each armed group depends on the number of combatants it is able to recruit. This is in turn a function of the relative ""distance"" between group leaderships and potential recruits. We emphasize the moral hazard problem of recruitment: fighting is costly and risky so combatants have the incentive to defect from their task. They can also desert altogether and join the enemy. This incentive is stronger the farther away the fighter is from the principal, since monitoring becomes increasingly costly. Bigger armies have more power but less monitoring capacity to prevent defection and desertion. This general framework allows a variety of interpretations of what type of proximity matters for building strong cohesive armies ranging from ethnic distance to geographic dispersion. Different assumptions about the distribution of potential fighters along the relevant dimension of conflict lead to different equilibria. We characterize these, discuss the implied outcome in terms of who wins the war, and illustrate with historical and contemporaneous case studies."
"June 10, 2008","Following closely the practice of peacekeeping, the literature on the subject has come in one small wave and then two larger ones. The first wave, during the Cold War, includes classic works focusing mainly on peacekeeping in wars between states. The second wave, at first inspired by the boom in peacekeeping shortly after the end of the Cold War, soon reflected disillusionment and focuses largely on failure and dysfunction, despite significant cases of success. The third and most recent wave also reflects a resurgence in peacekeeping but is newly concerned with systematic and methodologically rigorous analysis (both quantitative and qualitative) of basic empirical questions about the effects of peacekeeping and the sources of peacekeeping outcomes. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated peacekeeping's effectiveness in maintaining peace, but related questions persist concerning the use of force, transitional administrations, which organizations most effectively keep peace, perspectives of the ""peacekept,"" and effects on democratization."
"June 10, 2008","Little attention has been paid to the social processes of civil war - the transformation of social actors, structures, norms, and practices - that sometimes leave enduring legacies for the postwar period. In this article, I explore the changes wrought by six social processes: political mobilization, military socialization, polarization of social identities, militarization of local authority, transformation of gender roles, and fragmentation of the local political economy. Some of these social processes occur in peacetime, but war may radically change their pace, direction, or consequences, with perhaps irreversible effects. I trace the wide variation in these processes during the wars in four countries: Peru, El Salvador, Sri Lanka, and Sierra Leone. I analyze the effects of these processes as transformations in social networks. These processes reconfigure social networks in a variety of ways, creating new networks, dissolving some, and changing the structure of others."
"June 08, 2008","This article is the second in which Dean Wing explores the notion of secularism in different societies. The first was Critical Race Feminism Lifts the Veil?: Muslim Women, France and the Headscarf Ban, 39 U.C. Davis Law Review 745 (2006) (with Monica Nigh Smith). The article abstracted here examines the past, present, and future of secularism in the Republic of Turkey. The co-author Ozan Varol is a Turkish national, who was able to access Turkish sources.  Part II  provides an overview of the principle of secularism generally, and in Turkey specifically, and describes how Turkish secularism differs from the Western notion of secularism. Part III discusses the role of religion in the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor to the modern day Turkey, in order to provide a background for the legal developments that occurred after the Empire's collapse. Part IV outlines the reforms that Turkish founding president Atatýrk and his supporters implemented following the downfall of the Ottoman Empire and demonstrates how a fundamentalist empire became a strictly secular government in less than twenty years. Part V provides a thorough examination of the various provisions of the Turkish Constitution that relate to secularism. Part VI demonstrates the application of the principle of secularism in Turkey by discussing the legal history of the ban against the wearing of the Islamic headscarf in Turkish educational institutions. This Part also analyzes the November 10, 2005 decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Leyla Sahin v. Turkey, which upheld the Turkish government's ban and did not find it violated the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, Part VII speculates on the future of secularism in Turkey and discusses whether it is possible to implement any fundamental changes in the regime."
"June 06, 2008","This paper is a first step toward a more fundamental theory of political economy outcomes. We start from the fundamentals of the economy, given by preferences and technology; further, we specify all available technologies for the control of resources - such as armed forces or bribing. We model the interaction of agents in this economy as a game and examine all its equilibria. Equilibrium allocations must be such that individuals maximize their utility and that no group of individuals has the incentive to modify those allocations by (additional) usage of the technologies for the control of resources. The generality of our approach enables us to answer the question ""Is there something about the nature of a country that makes inefficient equilibria inevitable?"" We illustrate our approach by applying it to the natural resource curse. The model predicts that inefficient outcomes - in the form of either conflict or a deterrence army solution - will always occur as long as the value of natural resources to capture is positive and the opportunity cost of time - which partly determines soldiers' wages - is finite."
"June 06, 2008","There is much evidence to suggest that economic and social factors are major causes of civil unrest. However, governments often resort to the use of police and military to tackle such upheavals, rather than using policies that directly address the causes of discontent. This briefing uses data from India to compare the effectiveness of redistributive transfers and policing in reducing conflict. It finds that transfers have a significant effect on the prevention and reduction of civil unrest, particularly in the medium term. While policing reduces conflict in the short term, the continued use of police has either inconsequential effects, or even leads to increases in rioting. These findings have important lessons for other countries where social cohesion breaks frequently, but large-scale conflict may be avoidable."
"June 06, 2008","The deployment of civilian police in UN peacekeeping operations represents a significant commitment for many police organizations, especially in decentralized political systems such as Canada where municipal and provincial police services are involved. While these missions attract large numbers of highly motivated officers, their selection, deployment and return are fraught with organizational challenges that are underestimated or ignored by the contributing agencies. In this paper, we will examine these challenges as they are experienced and resolved by three large Canadian police organizations, through a number of qualitative interviews conducted with former police peacekeepers and their managers. We argue in this paper that the deployment and reintegration stages of a police peacekeeping mission should be included in the assessment of its success, and that unless contributing police organizations find ways to improve the experience of their returning officers, the sustainability of UN police peacekeeping deployments could become problematic."
"June 05, 2008","In this paper we organize the literature on the economics of terrorism around seven different topics, offering a comprehensive view of the literature with a view to identifying questions that remain unanswered. The chosen topic areas are: The Measurement of Terrorist Activity, The Nature of Terrorists, The Utility Cost of Terrorism, The Impact of Terrorism on Aggregate Output, Terrorism and Specific Sectors of Activity, Terrorism and Economic Policy, and Counter-Terrorism. In a sense, we proceed from measurement issues to studies of the characteristics of terrorists and terrorist organizations, the consequences of terrorism on individual utility and, aggregate output and on specific sectors of activity, as well as the impact of terrorism on fiscal and monetary policies. We conclude with an examination of the economics literature on counter-terrorism measures. For each of the topics above, we present what the literature has achieved, the important questions that remain open and the type of data that would help researchers make progress. In our discussion, we identify the main papers in the literature and the issue(s) where each made a contribution, presenting a brief individual summary for these papers, organized along the topic areas."
"June 05, 2008","This is the first of two articles discussing the status of Palestinian women after the 2006 Hamas electoral victory. The other article is entitled The Future of Palestinian Women's Rights: Lessons from a Half-Century of Tunisian Progress,  64 Wash & Lee L. Rev. 1551 (2007). The unexpected parliamentary electoral victory by the Islamist party Hamas in January 2006 shocked the world. This article speculates about how one aspect of Palestinian society may change in the long term under a Hamas-dominated regime - women's rights. Since Hamas is an Islamic organization, it may incorporate Islamic Shari'a law into the Palestinian legal system more broadly than the previous more secular government led by the Fatah party.  Part I describes selected aspects of the current legal status of Palestinian women in the areas of custom and religious practices. Part II examines the relevant constitutive documents as they relate to gender equality: The Basic Law of Palestine, and the draft constitution. Part III details the role of Hamas in the new Palestinian government and speculates briefly how Hamas' policies will influence Palestinian constitutionalism, including women's rights. The part provides an overview of Islamist movements in general and places Hamas within the wider spectrum of such movements across the Middle East. Then, it examines the history of Hamas as a political organization. Next, it explores Hamas' political position in part by looking at its Electoral Platform drafted for the fall 2005 campaign. Part IV provides some suggestions with respect to changing the Basic Law or the Draft Constitution to enhance women's rights. Due to the ongoing violence in the region, it is unlikely that these proposals will be considered at this time."
"June 04, 2008","I start with the premise that the war on Iraq was undoubtedly about oil. The prize was Iraq's spectacular oil wealth estimated at 330 billion barrels of proven, semi-proven and probable oil reserves. At current oil price of $130/barrel, the value of these reserves is estimated at $42.9 trillion, more than three times the United States' gross domestic product (GDP). Even Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank for seventeen years, says the Iraq war is largely about oil."
"June 02, 2008","This study uses the findings of a correspondence testing in order to assess the potential discrimination at job access level against young people of ethnic origin from the underprivileged suburbs of the Paris area (Ile-de-France). We measure simultaneously the effects of place of residence (privileged or underprivileged city), of nationality (French or Moroccan), and of sound of surname and of forename on the chances of obtaining a job interview when answering a job ad. We base our assessment on a controlled experiment conducted on the profession of accountant. We constructed 16 jobseeker profiles and sent 1097 resumes in reply to 139 job vacancies advertised at the end of 2006. We find evidence of a significant discrimination."
"June 02, 2008","In this article, attention will first be paid briefly to surveillance technology as such. An attempt will be made to sketch out the extent and the limitations of the techniques. A question then addressed is why the use of this technology is growing. Given the increasing interest in surveillance technology, an examination is made of the permissibility of the use of this technology taking certain constitutional and legal rights into account. What is the role of supervisory technology within the context of wider social developments? The article reaches the conclusion that with the increasing significance of surveillance technology and the increasing use of it the importance of ""monitoring the surveillors"" will increase as well."
"May 30, 2008","This article explores the exact nature of a state's due diligence obligation since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.  It addresses aspects of a state's due diligence obligation in reasonably protecting the international rights of states and of non-state actors generally and examines the interplay of this legal obligation with international non-state terror organisations.  The exact nature of the due diligence obligation that has emerged since 11 September demands ongoing and substantial counter-terrorism efforts by states, and this need seems to be recognised by state practice.  This article poses some questions and makes some observations regarding, among other issues, the implications of an international non-state terrorist organisation's attack abroad when the state on whose territory the organisation operates in unable, while acting with due diligence, to control the organisation."
"May 30, 2008","The Cold War was basically a period a neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism pursued on the pretext of threat perception by both the superpowers. The function of the Third World is to provide services for the rich, offering cheap labour, resources, markets, opportunities for investment, as Noam Chomsky said. Whenever a developing or an underdeveloped country of Asia, Africa or Latin America denies it to the West, conflict ensues. The Cold War epoch and the present global scenario only endorse this view."
"May 30, 2008","Short of the actual use of force, economic sanctions are among the U.S. government's most powerful tools in the war on terrorism. They seek to deprive terrorist organizations of the financial wherewithal to support and conduct operations such as the September 11 attacks on Washington and New York. Well before those events, however, the U.S. government had targeted Osama bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda organization with financial sanctions as part of three separate anti-terrorist programs established since the mid-1990s. The obvious question, then, is if these financial controls have been in place since as far back as 1996, why have they, not worked better at preventing terrorism? Moreover, how can we have any confidence that new sanctions will accomplish what the old controls evidently failed to achieve? This paper attempts to identify some of the issues these questions pose, and how those issues might be ameliorated or resolved."
"May 29, 2008","The recent announcement that the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom and two German energy companies intend to construct a new undersea Baltic pipeline that will bypass Poland has raised a fierce political storm in that country. In this paper, we aim to shed further light onto the forces that govern the proposed pipeline's interaction with Poland's energy, economic and geopolitical landscapes, by examining some of the public discourses and state policies that have been associated with the country's reaction to it. One of the our key findings is that the new gas link - recently named Nord Stream - is creating interlocking webs of socio-spatial paradoxes and contradictions that reverberate across the entire Baltic space. Thus, they simultaneously bind together and tear apart the territorial and political fabric of the region."
"May 27, 2008","The city of Amsterdam set up a project to develop and implement an administrative approach to combat organized crime the Van Traa-project. This project is internationally recognized as a successful example of such an approach. Elaborating on an evaluation study this article critically analyses the policy theory and the effects of this project. Many positive results can be observed, but it remains unclear to what extent these results have an impact on organized crime. Although some indications of a plausible impact of the measures taken in the Van Traa-project on organized crime were found, this article also refers to some indications of counterproductive effects."
"May 27, 2008","The author critically examines the challenges of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 to Canadian law, courts, sovereignty, and democracy. He compares these challenges to Canada's acceptance of nuclear arms in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, an event that caused George Grant in his Lament for a Nation to declare Canadian sovereignty and a distinctive Canadian democracy to be dead. The Anti-terrorism Act is examined in comparison to other expansions of the criminal law in response to tragic crimes, as well as against the increased emphasis in Canada and the United States on crime as a political issue. The author differentiates between respecting non-discrimination as a value in the criminal law and accepting victims' rights as a reason for limiting the rights of the accused. He also examines the dangers of relying on the criminal law to prevent terrorism and evaluates alternative administrative measures, including some contemplated in the proposed Public Safety Act."
"May 25, 2008","In the wake of Fiji's coup d'état of 2000, which unleashed an unprecedented level of violence and destruction to the country, the people of Fiji demanded a process of national reconciliation to heal the wounds of the past and build a more peaceful future. Fiji's troubled path to reconciliation has been marked by its failure to address issues of justice that lie at the heart of reconciliation: bringing to account perpetrators of violence; providing just reparation for victims; ensuring fair and equitable social and economic participation; and creating an opportunity for the country's communities to learn from its recent history of violence."
"May 25, 2008","The type of problem confronting human rights today is not Kosovo but Rwanda. Put differently, the problem is not the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention, but the overwhelming prevalence of inhumanitarian non-intervention. Empowering the United Nations, in this context, requires mobilizing the political will of member states as much as it does the creation of new legal rules. In this context, the rhetorical shift adopted by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty - from a right of intervention to the responsibility to protect - may mark the strongest advance in this contested area of international relations. Nevertheless, as recent years have demonstrated, enthusiasm about intervention can be - to say the least - a mixed blessing."
"May 23, 2008","We investigate how nondemocratic regimes use the military and how this can lead to the emergence of military dictatorships. Nondemocratic regimes need the use of force in order to remain in power, but this creates a political moral hazard problem' a strong military may not simply work as an agent of the elite but may turn against them in order to create a regime more in line with their own objectives. The political moral hazard problem increases the cost of using repression in nondemocratic regimes and in particular, necessitates high wages and policy concessions to the military. When these concessions are not sufficient, the military can take action against a nondemocratic regime in order to create its own dictatorship. A more important consequence of the presence of a strong military is that once transition to democracy takes place, the military poses a coup threat against the nascent democratic regime until it is reformed. The anticipation that the military will be reformed in the future acts as an additional motivation for the military to undertake coups against democratic governments. We show that greater inequality makes the use of the military in nondemocratic regimes more likely and also makes it more difficult for democracies to prevent military coups. In addition, greater inequality also makes it more likely that nondemocratic regimes are unable to solve the political moral hazard problem and thus creates another channel for the emergence of military dictatorships. We also show that greater natural resource rents make military coups against democracies more likely, but have ambiguous effects on the political equilibrium in nondemocracies (because with abundant natural resources, repression becomes more valuable to the elite, but also more expensive to maintain because of the more severe political moral hazard problem that natural resources induce). Finally, we discuss how the national defense role of the military interacts with its involvement in domestic politics."

"May 21, 2008","Covert organizations are constantly faced with a tradeoff between secrecy and operational effciency. Lindelauf, Borm and Hamers (2008) developed a theoretical framework to determine optimal homogeneous networks taking the above mentioned considerations explicitly into account. In this paper this framework is put to the test by applying it to the 2002 Jemaah Islamiyah Bali bombing. It is found that most aspects of this covert network can be explained by the theoretical framework. Some interactions however provide a higher risk to the network than others. The theoretical framework on covert networks is extended to accommodate for such heterogeneous interactions. Given a network structure the optimal location of one risky interaction is established. It is shown that the pair of individuals in the organization that should conduct the interaction that presents the highest risk to the organization, is the pair that is the least connected to the remainder of the network. Furthermore, optimal networks given a single risky interaction are approximated and compared. When choosing among a path, star and ring graph it is found that for low order graphs the path graph is best. When increasing the order of graphs under consideration a transition occurs such that the star graph becomes best. It is found that the higher the risk a single interaction presents to the covert network the later this transition from path to star graph occurs."
"May 21, 2008","This paper is a quantitative study looking at the relationship between the influence of women at the state, versus societal, level in reframing foreign policy, specifically in making decisions regarding involvement in conflict and development aid. The role of women in international affairs is a subject increasingly under scrutiny, due to its potential impact on changing the behavior of states. Women have long been thought to be ""more peaceful"" than men; as they become increasingly active participants in politics, is this pacifism being expressed through moderation of foreign policy tactics? A large-N quantitative study measuring how the proportion of women in legislative seats, literacy and labor participation in relation to a state's involvement in violent conflict as well as government budgeting for military and development aid finds there is an increasingly strong relationship between women's participation and policy outcomes."
"May 19, 2008","Mahmood Mamdani (1996, 1999) has attracted much attention with his historicising model of the trajectory of African politics. The most fertile innovation in Mamdani's work is to speak of the typical African state as 'bifurcated'. He generalises South Africa's apartheid system to the whole of Africa. On one side is a 'civilised' urban settler society that grew out of a history of direct rule and now practises a form of democracy. On the other side is a rural 'native' society that has been thoroughly ethnicised by a history of authoritarian indirect rule."
"May 19, 2008","We now know enough about the major episodes of ethnic violence around the end of the New Order to bring some intellectual rigour to the task of understanding them. Earlier essentialist (primordialist) views on the ethnic driving force have in the international literature given way to more constructivist (instrumentalist) views. But an important dividing line remains between those who see a fundamental rationality in episodes of ethnic violence (politics by other means) and those who do not. The former include structuralists, who highlight the material interests of whole groups, and rational choice theorists, who emphasise the deliberate choices of individuals, often elites. The latter group are mainly psychologists (including social psychology and collective behaviourism)."
"May 19, 2008","The post-conflict state - a state in the process of transition from violent conflict towards peace - is a particularly suitable legal guinea-pig to assess the challenges posed to traditional international law. In many respects, the post-conflict state offers an extrapolated microcosm of more general trends in international law: receding sovereignty, proliferation of actors and institutions, and increased emphasis on the rule of law and human rights as core ethical values of the system of international law."
"May 16, 2008","Cities have always experienced a degree of violence that radically differs from that of rural areas. While cities become more populated and social problems become more complex, the population faces increasing levels of violence. For example, in the last five years, there were over 20,000 gang-related murders in Guatemala. In Brazil alone, more than 100 people are killed by guns every day. This paper examines the legal regimes that regulate these new urban realities. It argues that international humanitarian law might not be the appropriate regime to provide protection as it tends to legitimize violence. However, can domestic law enforcement regimes and human rights adequately prevent the suffering of innocent victims and the recruitment of children into organized gangs? The paper suggests that the Inter-American System of Human Rights might provide some answers."
"May 15, 2008","The article examines the legal status of peace agreements, and whether and when they are framed as treaties, international agreements, domestic constitutions or legislation, or political pacts.  The article explore the relationship between a peace agreement's legalization and compliance with the peace agreement.  Conventional understandings of how legalization affects compliance are argued not to apply.  The article makes a case for understanding peace agreements as exhibiting a distinct 'law of the peacemaker' or lex pacificatoria, which operates as a transnational form of law similar to the lex mercatoria."
"May 12, 2008","The study of popular contention in rural China has become a veritable growth industry.  Some stock-taking is in order.  What do we know about the aims, means, and impact of collective action in the Chinese countryside? How widespread is it? Who is targeted? What forms does rural popular action take?  Who leads it and how organized it?  Why is it occurring?  What, more broadly, can the study of rural discontent and its consequence scontribut to the understanding of state-society relations in China?"
"May 09, 2008","In this qualitative study, through interviews with 31 Taoists and proponents of Aikido, the researcher uncovers the relevance and applications of Lao Tzu's Tao De Ching in business negotiations. This paper's intention is to look at Tao De Ching, understand its key tenets, and interestingly relate how the esoteric Tao De Ching can still be relevant and practical. Indeed, this 2,500 years-old Chinese wisdom can and should be aptly applied in modern negotiations."
"May 06, 2008","This research note provides a general introduction to REsCape: an agent-based computational framework for studying the relationship between natural resources, ethnicity, and civil war. By permitting the user to specify: (i) different resource profiles ranging from a purely agrarian economy to one based on the artisanal or industrial extraction of alluvial or kimberlite diamonds; (ii) different patterns of ethnic domination, ethnic polarization, and varying degrees of ethnic salience; as well as (iii) specific modes of play for key agents, the framework can be used to assess the effects of key variables whether taken in isolation or in various combinations on the onset and duration of civil war. Our objective is to make REsCape available as an open source toolkit in the future, one that can be used, modified, and refined by students and scholars of civil war."

"May 05, 2008","In his book, ""War by Other Means"", John Yoo, a former high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush, attempts to advance legal justifications for many of the Administration's most controversial programs in the war on terror, including coercive interrogations, the National Security Agency's wiretapping programs, military commissions, and The USA PATRIOT Act. Yoo, perhaps best known as the author of several of the so-called ""torture memos"" that the Administration used as the legal underpinning for its harsh questioning of detainees, argues that the president's constitutional role as commander in chief in a time of war allows almost any imaginable exercise of power by the executive that might be linked, however tenuously, to national security. In this essay, I assert that Yoo cannot be correct. His expansive reading of the wartime power of the executive makes the other branches of government, and even the Constitution itself, into an afterthought for any purpose the president may unilaterally ordain. While our system of government clearly gives the president considerable power to wage war and tend to foreign affairs, Yoo's vision takes us beyond protecting and defending the Constitution, to destroying it."
"May 05, 2008","This report presents the four main themes that emerged from a seminar organized by the International Peace Academy (now the International Peace Institute) and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy in Geneva on 29/30 November 2007. First, it addresses the question of the conceptual relationship between organised crime and peace operations, outlining a framework for functional analysis focusing on the complex environments in which international interventions take place and the functions that organised crime and peace operations play in those environments. Second, it looks at the causal relationship between peace operations and organised crime. Third, it turns to the strategic conclusions flowing from this analysis, investigating a number of trade-offs involved when peace operations confront organised crime. Last, it presents some of the most salient operational considerations and lessons learnt from the Seminar and the discussion papers prepared for it."
"May 05, 2008","In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court carried forward the international legal debate over the nature and regulation of armed conflicts between state and non-state actors that go beyond the territory of the state.  According to the prevailing interpretation of the Hamdan decision held by both scholars and the current Administration, the Court identified such conflicts as armed conflicts not of an international character, which are governed by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  One of the implications of this interpretation is that al Qaeda detainees are entitled only to the minimal protections enshrined in Common Article 3.  This Article challenges this interpretation by arguing that the Court deliberately avoided determining both the nature of the conflict in which the petitioner was captured and the nature of the applicable legal regime.  While the Court indeed applied Common Article 3 to this conflict, it regarded Common Article 3 as a minimum rather than necessarily as an exhaustive legal regime.  The boundaries that the Court marked for future debate are therefore much wider than understood by many thus far.  The Article ends with a call to the Administration to revisit its interpretation of the decision and consider whether al Qaeda detainees are legally entitled to further protections beyond those afforded in Common Article 3."

"April 30, 2008","Although property rights are the cornerstone of capitalist economics, throughout history existing claims have been frequently overturned and redefined by revolution. A fundamental question for economists is what makes revolutions more likely to occur. A large literature has found contradictory evidence for the effect of income and income inequality on revolt, possibly owing to omitted variable bias.  The primary innovation of the paper is to tackle this problem by introducting a new panel data set derived from surveys of revolutionary support across one-quarter of a million randomly sampled individuals. This allows one to control for unobserved fixed effects. The regressions are based on a choice-theoretic model of revolt. After controlling for personal characteristics, country and year fixed effects, more people are found to favour revolt when inequality is high and their net incomes are low. A policy that decreases inequality equivalent to a shift from the US to Luxemburg is predicted to decrease support for revolt by 7.7 percentage points. A decrease of net income of $US 3,510 (in 1985 constant dollars) increases revolutionary support by the same amount. The results indicate that 'going for growth', or implementing policies that reduce inequality, can buy nations out of revolt."
"April 30, 2008","West Kalimantan (West Borneo) has a history of violent communal conflict.  It also has extensive forests that have been looted for decades. The argument will be that these two are linked, but not by the grievances of the forest dwellers. Except in its first few days, the two main episodes of 1997 and 1999 were not driven mainly by grievances among marginal groups. Rather, explanations based on the 'resource curse' carry more weight. These focus attention on the contested nature of the state, rather than on rebellious activities of marginal groups. When state institutions were thrown into disarray by the sudden resignation of President Suharto in 1998, Dayak militants already close to state power rewrote the rules of local politics by demonstratively 'cleansing' certain areas of an unpopular immigrant minority. This theatrical maneouvre impressed political rivals sufficiently to allow Dayaks to gain control over several timber-rich districts, which had a thriving black economy. Malays later imitated these techniques to stem the tide."
"April 30, 2008","During World War I, Sigmund Freud and his followers held a special symposium in Budapest entitled ""Psycho-Analysis and the War Neuroses."" Their contributions centered on the importance of trying to understand what can cause a soldier to become traumatized in war by investigating the individual factors of each case as opposed to merely the situational factors. Thus by redefining such ambiguous illnesses as shell shock and war strain into the Freudian framework of the traumatic neuroses, they were able to do what the neurologists could not - explain the meaning behind the soldiers' symptoms and treat them with successful results. However, as the programmatic strategy of the symposium led the contributors to focus almost exclusively on the soldier's fear of death as opposed to the anxiety over killing, this paper will explore the few places where killing is discussed in order to attempt to find a place for it within this framework. This investigation will then allow us to better understand the role that factors such as military training, discipline, and patriotism play in mediating the trauma of killing so that we can use such research to find ways to reduce the suffering of soldiers."
"April 30, 2008","While scholars in the United States increasingly focus on the empirical dimension of legal scholarship, there have been challenges in using empiricism to explore international legal issues.  Rather than relying on logic or instinct alone, empirical methodologies can provide scholars with tools to gain new facts, see existing ideas through a different lens, and engage in a more nuanced analysis of international law phenomena. There appears to be a natural synergy between empiricism and international investment treaty dispute resolution. With calls for trade time outs by U.S. presidential candidates, there is interest in how investment treaties function, whether they achieve their goals, and at what cost. Given the implications for public policy, international relations, and allocation of domestic financial resources, empirical assessment of international investment law is not misplaced. This Essay considers the efficacy of using empirical methodologies to gain insights about the resolution of investment treaty disputes and international investment law. Part I considers the historical tensions between international law and empiricism and moves towards reintegration. Part II explores what form empiricism might take and argues for a broad understanding of empiricism. Part III analyzes how to develop an empirical approach in light of the costs and benefits and proposes five steps to facilitate the creation of an empirical research agenda for international investment treaty dispute resolution. While recognizing that empiricism is not a panacea, the Essay suggests that the benefits of making empiricism part of the methodological landscape of investment treaty dispute resolution scholarship are worth the costs. Empiricism offers a chance to obtain accurate information about investment disputes, correct misperceptions about existing dispute resolution processes, permits considered analysis of legal issues affecting the public, and facilitates informed decisions about the negotiation and revision of investment treaties."
"April 30, 2008","The conflictual aspects of ethnic relations will concern us most in this chapter. Until 1998, Indonesia was not among the nations that sprang to mind in studies of ethnic conflict. But when the authoritarian New Order regime collapsed in May 1998, ethnic conflict became the biggest unpleasant surprise for Indonesians aspiring to democracy."
"April 30, 2008","This discussion paper, presented in response to an address to the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights (University College Cork) by Dean John D. Hutson, aims to highlight the role that law and lawyers play in bolstering the U.S. Administration's desired legal interpretations, which in turn legitimate their desired actions even in clear contravention of international law (including jus cogens). The very short discussion document considers this in relation to three categories of lawyering - government lawyering, academic lawyering, and court-based practice."
"April 30, 2008","Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan provide contrasting case studies that demonstrate, each in their own way, the need to 'disaggregate' our view of the Indonesian state. In Central Kalimantan, the centre stood by while local elites plunged the province into a frenzy of ethnic cleansing. In wealthy East Kalimantan, local elites largely resisted the temptations of ethnic mobilisation and enjoyed the benefits of regional autonomy."
"April 30, 2008","A fundamental issue for economists is what determines civil conflict. One unsettled question is the relative importance of political freedoms versus economic development. This paper takes a new approach to provide an answer by using micro-data based on surveys of revolutionary preferences of 130,000 people living in 61 nations between 1980 and 1997. Controlling for personal characteristics, country and year fixed effects, more freedom and economic growth both reduce revolutionary support. Losing one level of freedom, equivalent to a shift from the US to Turkey, increases support for revolt by 4 percentage points. To reduce support by the same amount requires adding 14 percentage points on to the GDP growth rate. Being Muslim in a free country has no effect on the probability of supporting revolt compared to a non-religious person. However, being Muslim in a country that is not free increases it by 13 percentage points. Being Christian in a free country decreases the chance of supporting revolt by 4 percentage points, compared to a non-religious person, and in a not-free country by 1 percentage point."
"April 29, 2008","The withdrawal (disengagement) from the Gaza strip, including the dismantling of Jewish settlements and evacuation of Jewish settlers, was the main Israeli Government's policy during the years 2004-2005. The Israeli Government voted in favor of the Disengagement, and the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament) ratified the plan by a majority vote. Despite the massive public pressure wielded by the settlers and their supporters, the Disengagement Plan was not submitted for a national referendum, primarily because the referendum is not an accepted procedure in the Israeli representative democracy. Supported by their religious leadership, the settlers and their supporters launched a campaign challenging the evacuation's legitimacy. Attempting to prevent its implementation, they resorted to numerous protest measures, including marches and demonstrations. The purpose of this article is to examine the most important decisions relating to the Disengagement Plan. As it will be shown, the High Court undertook a substantive examination of all the petitions relating to the disengagement. It exercised close and ongoing supervision of the process; it confirmed and legitimized all of the decisions, and was a full and active partner to the Disengagement Plan, defending both its legality and its constitutionality at all stages. Conceivably, another court in another place would have perhaps declined to intervene or even give judicial consideration to this kind of State-political decision, which was also the source of a deep political-public controversy. Not so the Israeli Court, which became a full and senior partner to the entire plan."
"April 29, 2008","Terrorism defies democracy. It poses enormous challenges to a democratic state. Not all means available to fight terrorism are necessarily legal or justifiable and decisions taken might be inconsistent with democratic values. Combating terrorism demands the sensitive assessment of issues and striking a balance between the claims of national security on the one hand and the principles of human rights on the other. In October 2000 the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which many hoped was coming to an end, entered a new phase. Suicide bombings in Israel and curfews on the West Bank became routine. The new Intifada1 and Israeli military operations in Palestinian cities posed serious questions regarding the balance between the defense of human rights and the security needs of the state at a time of war. Is the collective punishment of an entire city legitimate? Is it permissible to destroy the homes of suicide bombers? What legal instruments, if any, should the Court use to review the actions of the security forces? Should the legal powers of the Israeli Defense Forces  and of other bodies dealing with terrorism be increased? What should the scope of judicial intervention be when dealing with measures used against terrorism?"

"April 25, 2008","The International Law Commission (ILC) recently transmitted the Draft Articles on the law of transboundary aquifers (Draft Articles), through the Secretary-General to Governments for comment.  This article looks at the tension between the goal of obtaining an international freshwater treaty and the ILC's work to draft a new legal regime for transboundary aquifers.  The author does not question the vital importance of transboundary aquifers or that they are in need of legal principles for optimal utilization, protection from pollution and sustainability. The issue this paper raises is whether a second international legal instrument for freshwater will further these goals.  In particular, the author examines two issues: 1) the problems associated with bifurcated water laws where groundwater and surface water are governed by different legal regimes cautioning that the problems experienced in these regimes should be avoided for international watercourses and 2) the inclusion of a draft article on sovereignty over transboundary aquifers."
"April 24, 2008","Do legal institutions that limit governmental power promote order in democracies? The worldwide rule of law project is predicated on knowing the answer to this question; however, there is no systematic empirical test of the relationship between legal institutions that constrain arbitrary state power and democratic order. Indeed, the mainstream literature on democratic survival simply ignores the influence of effective legal institutions, focusing instead on sociocultural and macro-economic factors that render individuals vulnerable to government predation on financial assets and violations of physical integrity. Following North, Summerhill and Weingast (2000) we suggest that ensuring the democratic order requires the resolution of a variety of commitment problems over rights, and one way of doing so is through the construction of (or at least the emergence of) legal institutions that constrain state power. Indeed, such institutions should be most useful when states are most at risk to breakdown as a result of unfortunate macro-economic or sociocultural conditions.  We find that effective legal institutions are positively associated with democratic survival and negatively associated with violent political events, two central measures of democratic order. We also find that the effect of effective legal institutions on survival is strongest in socioculturally diverse states."
"April 24, 2008","The main aim of Jeff McMahan's manuscript on the morality of war is to answer the question: why and accordingly when is it justified or permissible to kill people in war? However, McMahan argues that the same principles apply to individual actions and to war. McMahan rejects all doctrines of collective responsibility and liability. His claim is that every individual is liable for what he has done and not for the actions of others - even if both are part of the same collective. Accordingly, McMahan challenges the common view that it is much easier to justify killing in war compared to killing in other contexts. Therefore, the scope of his project exceeds the context of war and extends to interpersonal conflicts between individuals that do not qualify as war. Many of McMahan's main claims are appealing. Particularly, appealing is his rejection of the collectivist account of war. Indeed, it seems that the simple story according to which people are responsible solely for their actions - rather than (also) to the actions of others - should be held on until a different, more complex, account of collective responsibility is put forward and its plausibility is explained. Therefore, the article focuses on the general principles advocated by McMahan with regard to the resolution of all interpersonal conflicts: Whether these conflicts are small scale or large scale (that is, whether few or a many people are involved in the conflict), and within the latter category of conflicts involving many people, whether these conflicts qualify as war (according to some standard) or not."
"April 23, 2008","Since the devastating terrorist events of September 11, 2001 and the bombing of the Sari Nightclub in Bali, measures have been taken to minimise the terrorist threat in each Australian jurisdiction. The commonwealth has responded to this threat by amending the federal offence of treason and increasing the power of intelligence authorities to apprehend, investigate and detain persons suspected of terrorism. The states have responded by mirroring certain commonwealth provisions in addition to increasing the stop and search powers of the police. Apart from entering into a collaborative agreement to minimise the terrorist threat, each jurisdiction has encouraged individuals to complement government initiatives by acting prudentially to report any suspicious behaviour leading to a potential terrorist incident. This article explores the legislative response to terrorism following September 11, 2001, arguing that the very nature and threat which terrorism imposes on the stability of Nation States goes to their failings as institutions of consolidated government and control. Focusing on the Foucauldian critique of the State, this article assesses the nature of the terrorist threat, explaining how this threat undermines the traditional defence mechanisms of the Nation State and how, as a response to this failing, the State is left with little choice but to impede, suppress or otherwise utilise the liberty of the individual."
"April 22, 2008","The main purpose of this article is to explore the role that informal organisations play in the legitimisation of regime change and the failure of key modern theories of globalisation and international relations (I.R.) to fully accredit the centrality of civic groups as agents of change. Following this, we use constructivist methodology in explaining gradual shifts in ideological mindsets and the socio-political aspirations. Briefly reviewing current events, this paper appraises the significance of unauthorised dissident movements, and their involvement in the proliferation of prominent trends, such as democratisation and terrorism."
"April 22, 2008","Scriven (1994) states that some existing procedures for the summative ex-ante evaluation of the effects of strategic development programs are erroneous. This paper studies the problem using a standard matrix approach (Leopold, 1971; Ekins and Medhurst, 2003) to the evaluation of the development programme for the Slovene region of Pomurje (RDPP) as a case study. It is assumed that summation of diverse policy impacts is a complex task, since it is possible to make conflicting assessments due to: (i) incommensurable scopes of operation (I-scopes: economic, social, human, ecological) and concurrently (ii) incommensurable scales with which they are assessed (I-scales: micro, meso, macro). Three matrix assessment approaches are compared that apply different summative techniques in synthesising detailed expert assessments of individual policy measure's impacts. The first, Leopold matrix is detailed and conceived on the micro-scale and does not permit summation of individual impacts into aggregate impact to avoid mixing incomensurabilities. Ekins and Medhurst (2003) proposed vertically and horizontally reduced matrix where columns are condensed on the four main I-scopes only; then they allowed for vertical aggregation of all policy impacts represented in rows of their matrix on each particular I-scope. However, this macro-summation approach is unappropriate, as the effects of individual policy measures on each I-scope are not homogenous (Rotmans, 2006), and therefore can only be aggregated by source and area of impact, i.e. partially. Their summative procedure has been thus demoted into a square Leontief matrix (1970) of I-scopes that presents the RDPP in the meso-perspective. This introduces I-scales to the evaluation. From a meso-matrix view I-scopes are evident at the micro-scale as conditionally substitutive, incommensurable at the meso-scale, while complementary at the macro-scale. The proposed summative procedure retains three types of development conflict intact for study: exclusion at the macro-scale, legitimate conflicts at the meso-scale, and transaction conflicts at the micro-scale. The paper concludes that an appropriate summative evaluation of strategic policy intervention is a condition for correctly diagnosing the nature of development conflicts, which is a condition not only for politically relevant but equally for independent and neutral strategic policy evaluation."
"April 21, 2008","In Central America, legislation aiming to reduce violence and crime has become an important topic in the security debate. Focusing on Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, this paper analyzes laws and other legal texts regarding the trade in and consumption of drugs on the one hand, and gender-related violence on the other. It shows how the content and the wording of legal texts contribute to the social construction of stereotyped offenders, such as youth gang members, drug users, or foreign nationals. The legal texts in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua reflect both the hegemonic and the counter-discursive influences on each country's legal discourse."
"April 18, 2008","This Article examines the use of alternative sanctions in international law using the exemplar of the abuses at Abu Ghraib. It argues that social sanctions like shaming have a powerful role to play in enforcing international law norms. When properly deployed, shaming activity by the international community can serve to influence the offending state to take corrective action and fill the enforcement gap in international law. This is the lesson from Abu Ghraib. There is evidence that the abuses so vividly depicted in the now infamous photographs were not an aberration, but had occurred for a considerable time despite complaints. It took a shaming campaign for expressions of regret and corrective action to ensue. The campaign forced U.S. citizens to come to terms with the fact that their government was acting in violation of internalized international norms (againsttorture). The coincidence of international law norms with internalized domestic norms facilitated expeditious corrective action."
"April 18, 2008","This paper focuses on the main factors that contribute to the dangers of violent internal conflict erupting, or re-igniting after a peace has been concluded. The conflict literature has identified greed and grievance as the principle causes of conflict. But for either of them to take the form of large-scale violence there must be other factors at work, specifically a weakening of the 'social contract'. Such a viable social contract can be sufficient to restrain opportunistic behaviour such as theft of resource rents and violent expression of grievance. The social contract, therefore, refers to the mechanisms and institutions of peaceful conflict resolution. Three main risk factors are considered in this briefing: The breakdown of redistributive mechanisms, democratic transitions and lack of economic progress."
"April 18, 2008","This paper is written as an effort to escape the dialogue of the deaf between those who believe that international law can do no wrong in the war on terrorism and those who argue its utter irrelevance. It argues that international law can be seen as a tool for governance of the suspended space between war and peace, characteristic of the so-called war on terror. Through the case of the terrorist blacklist administrated by the UN's 1267 Committee, it shows how administrative law, and not the law of war, is the paradigm of the international legal order within antiterrorist policy. International law, then, is not to be read as a matter of rights, but as a legal form, which features independent agency. It is in the legal form and its design, and not in the current obsession with compliance, where the possibilities of resistance in this new time exist."
"April 18, 2008","Between 1966 and 1979, four serving generals directed the affairs of the Nigerian nation. This paper looks at the things (laws) that purport to make the management or performance of the executive functions of the Nigerian government by the armed forces legal or illegal. First, the paper looks at the law prior to the first military incursion into the political arena with a view to determining if there was anything that made it illegal for the military to take over the executive powers of the government of Nigeria."
"April 17, 2008","Establishing the rule of law is increasingly seen as the panacea for all the problems that afflict many non-western countries, particularly in post-conflict settings. Development experts prescribe it as the surest short cut to market-led growth; human rights groups advocate the rule of law as the best defense against human rights abuses; and in the area of peace and security, the rule of law is seen as the surest guarantee against the (re)-emergence of conflicts and the basis for rebuilding post-conflict societies. Therefore, in a very direct sense, the rule of law has come to be seen as the common element that development experts, security analysts and human rights activists agree upon and as the mechanism that links these disparate areas. In this article, I argue that this new-found fascination with the rule of law is misplaced. Underlying this 'linkage' idea is, I would suggest, a desire to escape from politics, by imagining the rule of law as technical, legal and apolitical.  In other words, there is a tendency to think that failures of development, threats to security and human rights violations could all be avoided or managed by a resort to law. I argue that there is in fact a need to retain politics at the center of the discussions of development, human rights and security. In addition, I also argue that the invocation of rule of law hides many contradictions between the different policy agendas themselves (such as between development and human rights or between security and human rights) that cannot be fully 'resolved' by invoking the 'rule of law' as a mantra. It is far more important to inquire into the real consequences of these agendas on ordinary people. Focusing attention on the rule of law as a broad if not lofty concept diverts attention from the coherence, effectiveness or legitimacy of specific policies that are pursued to ensure security, promote development or protect human rights. The rule of law agenda threatens to obfuscate the real tradeoffs that need to be made in order to achieve these worthy goals."
"April 17, 2008","In December 2003, the Government of Uganda referred the situation in conflict-torn northern Uganda to the nascent International Criminal Court.  It was the first referral by a State Party under Article 14 of the Rome Statute of ICC and led to the indictment of five leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).  Four years later, Uganda found itself in the midst of promising peace negotiations with the LRA.  A major obstacle to a final agreement was the refusal of the indicted leaders to face ICC justice.  Seeking to peacefully resolve the conflict, the Government signed a preliminary agreement in which it would assume the prosecution of the indictees.  Under the principle of complementarity embedded in Article 17 of the Rome Statute, the ICC cannot prosecute where a jurisdictional state has undertaken investigation or prosecution, unless the State's action is in an attempt to shield the accused from justice.  However, with the case against the LRA leaders already deemed admissible, an admissibility challenge would be necessary to withdraw the ICC indictments.  This paper examines the various and complex issues regarding both the nature of challenging admissibility generally and particular issues that arise from such challenges in the context of State self-referrals.  The article proposes three different visions of complementarity as a means of understanding the boundaries within which the Court may situate a decision, and applies them to the hypothetical situation of an admissibility challenge to the LRA indictments.  The options of both the indictees and Uganda are explored and the prospects for a successful challenge are examined.  The paper concludes by suggesting a critical role for the Court in both resolving conflict and shaping the contours of acceptable domestic efforts to bring those responsible for grave crimes to justice."
"April 15, 2008","This Recent Development focuses on the legal standards that would govern the treatment and interrogation tactics applicable to detainees held by the United States abroad after the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). The article first discusses the legal implications of the DTA as to U.S. law on the use of torture or CID treatment, which primarily concerns Sections 1002 and 1003 of the DTA. Then, it explores certain shortfalls in the scope of these sections on this issue, as the sections do not fully address all of the potential ways in which detainee abuse and torture might continue. Finally, a brief summary of the other sections of the DTA is presented."
"April 15, 2008","On October 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). Congress passed the MCA to authorize the trial by military commissions of detained terrorism suspects after the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld invalidated the military commissions previously established pursuant to a 2001 military order from President Bush. The MCA adds chapter 47A to title 10 of the U.S. Code to give statutory authorization for the military commissions. This Recent Development explores some of the more controversial aspects of the MCA, especially those sections that respond to the Court's Hamdan decision.  The note is divided into four sections: jurisdiction, procedure, judicial review, and the Geneva Conventions."
"April 15, 2008","This timely article describes the powers of the United Nations Security Council as they have developed in the field of non-proliferation, and proposes a normative framework based on the model of reciprocal confidence-building that would bridge the dissonance between legality and legitimacy in the Security Council's practice. Recent proliferation crises, concerning Iran, North Korea, and non-state proliferation networks, have led the Council draw upon various sources and resources' express and implied powers under the UN Charter, powers granted by specific treaties, international consensus' to expand its powers."
"April 14, 2008","Using interviews, leadership speeches, and archival materials, this article reviews how autonomous villagers' committees appeared in Guangxi in the early 1980s and how they were transformed into a replacement for production brigades.  It also examines the preferences of various actors involved in implementing village elections, including the Party Organization Department, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and its local staff, local authorities, and ordinary villagers.  The article concludes that elections were designed to rejuvenate grassroots leadership by cleaning out incompetent, corrupt, and high-handed cadres, all for the purpose of consolidating one-Party rule.  But it also highlights a potential alliance between frustrated villagers and reformist elites that may yet produce a village leadership in which every cadre is held accountable in free and fair elections."
"April 14, 2008","Based on in-depth interviews, survey data, and archival sources, this paper analyzes the origins of nostalgia for Maoist mass campaigns directed against corruption and other malfeasance engaged in by local officials. It argues that campaign nostalgia is an indicator of frustration and unmet expectations. Its origins trace to an unwillingness on the part of the Party leadership to rely on mass mobilization to check cadre corruption. Although nostalgic villagers undoubtedly underestimate the downside of mass movements while conjuring up an idyllic era of official probity, it is understandable that these individuals long for a romanticized version of the rectifications of old and dismiss ineffective clean government drives, legal remedies and bureaucratic supervision as feeble replacements for centrally sponsored, direct struggle against wrongdoers.  Still, campaign nostalgia may wane as institutional anti-corruption measures take hold and popular confidence in rule by law builds up. Continuing economic growth and village elections, at least in some locations, may also help reduce the popular yearning for mass mobilization."
"April 14, 2008","How do Chinese local officials define their tasks and distinguish between policies that must be executed and those they can safely ignore?  Drawing on ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up"" approaches to implementation, we examine how much discretion rural leaders enjoy and how this discretion affects policy delivery.  Archival sources and interviews show that selective implementation is an outgrowth of the institutions that govern cadre management.  One-level-down management, the end of mass campaigns, and cadre responsibility systems have led local officials to urge villagers to pay their taxes, accept cremation, and practice birth control, but to ignore less measurable policies that forbid excessive extraction and coercive behavior.  Efforts to address misimplementation are also discussed, including ""rightful resistance"" by aggrieved villagers."
"April 14, 2008","Two prominent theories of legal decision making provide seemingly contradictory explanations for judicial outcomes. In political science, the Attitudinal Model suggests that judicial outcomes are driven by judges' sincere policy preferences - judges bring their ideological inclinations to the decision making process and their case outcome choices largely reflect these policy preferences. In contrast, in the law and economics literature, Priest and Klein's well-known Selection Hypothesis posits that court outcomes are largely driven by the litigants' strategic choices in the selection of cases for formal dispute or adjudication - forward thinking litigants settle cases where potential judicial outcomes are readily discernable (e.g. judicial attitudes are known), hence nullifying the impact of judicial ideological preferences on case outcomes. We believe that the strategic case sorting process proposed in the law and economics literature does, in fact, affect the influence of judge ideology or attitudes on judicial outcomes. However, these two perspectives can be effectively wed to provide an integrated model of judicial decision making that accounts for the influences of both the strategic behavior of litigants and the attitudinal preferences of judges. We test this integrated model of decision making on case outcomes in the U.S. Supreme Court and employ an interactive specification to assess the influence of judicial ideology on Supreme Court outcomes while simultaneously accounting for litigants' (and justices) strategic case sorting behavior."
"April 14, 2008","Interviews and archival research on the dynamics of cadre-mass contention show that lodging complaints is a common (and potentially effective) way for Chinese villagers to defy grassroots leaders.  Even without meaningful democratization, structural changes in mass-elite relations enable villagers to resist arbitrary, predatory, and highhanded official behavior.  Village cadres, who previously had enormous discretion, are increasingly frequently challenged by villagers who live outside communes and travel widely to market, who hear about defiance elsewhere, and who use the cadre responsibility system, village charters, the Organic Law of Villagers' Committees, and the Administrative Litigation Law to defend and advance their interests."
"April 13, 2008","Given the widespread focus on socioeconomic factors, it comes as no surprise that religion is neglected in most theoretical explanations of African civil conflicts. While scholarly interest is increasing in light of the civil wars in Sudan, Nigeria, and northern Uganda, no systematic empirical analysis has been undertaken to date. Hence, this paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the role of religions in sub-Saharan civil conflicts. Quantitative and qualitative analysis based on a newly compiled database including 28 violent conflicts show that religion plays a role more frequently than is usually assumed and that the effects of religions are principally ambiguous. Religious actors and institutions have escalating effects in many cases, yet more often they become active for peace. Religious identities and ideas seem to have a particular impact on conflict. Even though religion seems secondary when compared to classical ""risk factors,"" the findings demonstrate that religious factors have to be taken seriously when analyzing civil conflicts in Africa."
"April 13, 2008","Using interviews with peasants and cadres in North China, compliant villagers (shunmin), recalcitrants (dingzihu), and policy-based resisters (diaomin) are distinguished by reference to their resistance routines (or lack of resistance).  Compared to both violent acts and ""everyday forms of resistance,"" policy-based resistance is typically less risky and more effective, because its practitioners employ beneficial central policies to defy local leaders who they believe have ignored or violated these policies.  Acting under the sufferance of authorities at higher levels and within the rubric of prevailing political values and norms, policy-based resisters occupy an intermediate position between subjects and citizens.  Moreover, their active pursuit of policy-based (sometimes proactive) claims may indicate the growth of rights consciousness in the Chinese countryside."
"April 11, 2008","Following its transition to democracy from an authoritarian military rule marked by gross violations of human rights, Nigeria established the Human Rights Violations Investigations Commission (HRVIC) in 1999. This paper critically examines the contributions of the HRVIC, popularly known as the Oputa Panel, to the field of transitional justice and the rule of law. It sets out the process of establishing the Commission, its mandate and how this mandate was interpreted during the course of the Commission's work. The challenges faced by the Oputa Panel, particularly those that relate to its legal status and relationship with the judiciary, are analyzed in an attempt to draw useful guidelines from these challenges for other truth commissions. Recourse by powerful individuals to the judicial process in a bid to shield themselves from the HRVIC merits particular review as it raises questions regarding the transformation of the judiciary and the rule of law in the wake of an authoritarian regime."
"April 09, 2008","In well-functioning domestic legal systems, courts provide a mechanism through which commitments and obligations are enforced.  A party that fails to honor its obligations can be hauled before a court and sanctioned through seizure of person or property.  The international arena also has courts or, to expand the category somewhat, tribunals.  These institutions, however, lack the enforcement powers of domestic courts.  How, then, do they work, and how might they work better or worse?  The first objective of this Article is to establish that the role of the tribunal is to promote compliance with some underlying substantive legal rule.  This simple yet often overlooked point provides a metric by which to measure the effectiveness of tribunals.  But a tribunal does not operate in isolation.  The use of a tribunal is one way to resolve a dispute, but reliance on diplomacy and other traditional tools of international relations is another.  Furthermore, even if a case is filed with a tribunal, there may be settlement prior to a ruling and, even if there is a ruling the losing party may refuse to comply.  To properly understand international tribunals, then, requires consideration of the entire range of possible outcomes to a dispute, including those that do not involve formal litigation.  The second goal of the Article is develop a rational choice model of dispute resolution and tribunals that takes this reality into account.  The third goal is to explore, based on the above model, various features of international tribunals and identify those that increase effectiveness and those that reduce it.  Finally, the article applies the analysis to help us understand two prominent tribunals, the World Trade Organization's Appellate Body and the United Nations Human Rights Committee."
"April 05, 2008","Recurrent episodes of civil unrest significantly reduce the potential for economic growth and poverty reduction. Yet the economics literature offers little understanding of what triggers civil unrest in society and how to prevent it. This paper provides a theoretical analysis in a dynamic setting of the merits of redistributive transfers in preventing the onset of (and reducing) civil unrest and compare it with policies of more direct intervention such as the use of police. We present empirical evidence for a panel of Indian states, where conflict, transfers and policing are treated as endogenous variables. Our empirical results show, in the mediumterm, redistributive transfers are both a more successful and cost-effective means to reduce civil unrest. Policing is at best a short-term strategy. In the longer term, it may trigger further social discontent."
"April 04, 2008","In the 1990s no-fly zones were introduced as a new way to utilize airpower in the context of Peace Support Operations (PSOs). During that time, they were put to use over Iraq and over Bosnia. However, it is unclear to what extent the no-fly zones were successful in those two instances. This article examines the capabilities of no-fly zones and analyzes the Iraq and Bosnia cases of enforcement. It concludes that no-fly zones can be very effective if properly implemented and offers guidance for policy-makers on how to achieve maximum efficacy."
"April 04, 2008","Mosque-state separation and religious freedom appear to have stalled in the Middle East.  Recent public opinion surveys, however, indicate that in a number of key Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq and Algeria, a majority of people favor mosque-state separation.  The question, then, is how to help this majority advance its interests vis-a-vis vocal extremists.  This article presents an example of a different group of advocates for separation of religion and politics - the Founding Fathers of the United States of America.  It argues that their approach serves as a valuable template and shows how the arguments they used to persuade their deeply religious fellow citizens to favor separation of religion and politics can be applied in the Middle East today."
"April 02, 2008","Burkina Faso's rich civic institutions are rooted in the history of the precolonial Mossi kingdoms, the traditions of stateless societies in the southwest, the Islamic brotherhoods that structure the lives of Muslims, the hundred-year presence of the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant missionary societies, and popular struggles for representation during the colonial and postindependence periods. This heritage is a constant feature of contemporary political discourse, with critics accusing the current regime of betraying the country's political traditions. The regime's defenders emphasize its continuity with the past and its efforts to restore civic life after the excesses of the revolutionary period of the 1980s."
"March 31, 2008","There is growing recognition that significant threats to collective security emerge not only from competition among great powers, but also from the disorder, violence, and oppression wrought by governments (or occurring in the absence of effective governance) across the developing world. Scholars have responded by proposing new models of intervention - including neo-trusteeship and shared sovereignty - that respond to these failures of governance. But these calls for intervention rest on two underlying assumptions that have escaped serious consideration: the idea the countries cannot recover from conflict on their own and the argument that intervention is the best strategy for state-building. In this article, I define and describe a process of autonomous recovery in which states achieve a lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and post-war political and economic development in the absence of international intervention. I offer a series of theoretical reasons to take it seriously and use case studies of recovery in Uganda, Eritrea, and Somalia to demonstrate how it works in practice. I conclude by identifying three tradeoffs - for the country on the receiving end of intervention - that policymakers confront when weighing whether and how to respond to internal conflict."
"March 31, 2008","The launch of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) soon after September 11, 2001 has been predicted to fundamentally alter U.S. foreign aid programs. In particular, there is a common expectation that development assistance will be used to support strategic allies in the GWOT, perhaps at the expense of anti-poverty programs. In this paper we assess changes in country allocation by USAID over 1998-2001 versus 2002-05. In addition to standard aid allocation variables, we add several proxies for the GWOT, including the presence of foreign terrorist groups, sharing a border with a state sponsor of terrorism, troop contribution in Iraq, and relative share of Muslim population. We find that any major changes in aid allocation related to the GWOT appear to be affecting only a handful of critical countries, namely, Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, and the Palestinian Territories. The extra resources to these countries also seem to be coming from overall increases in the bilateral aid envelope, combined with declines in aid to Israel, Egypt, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We do not find that any of our GWOT proxies (or their interactions) are significantly correlated with changes in country allocation of aid flows to the rest of the world, including to sub-Saharan African countries. Concerns that there is a large and systematic diversion of U.S. foreign aid from fighting poverty to fighting the GWOT do not so far appear to have been realized."
"March 27, 2008","This Article contextualizes the Senate debates leading to the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA)  within broader American cultural narratives about the law and lawyers' roles in society.  This linguistic and cultural analysis describes elements of the DTA and the broader legal regime created in the aftermath of 9/11 that have subverted once-sacrosanct ideals, including the rule of law and basic procedural fairness, as merely the latest and most extreme of similar measures adopted over the last two decades to combat the spread of rights and access to justice.  The ""enemy combatant"" is shown to be one in a line of dominant cultural images or metaphors, including the ""conniving claimant"" and ""predator lawyers,"" all of which are products of what Marc Galanter long ago identified as the ""jaundiced view of the law"":  a perspective on law and lawyers that portrays them as undermining, rather than upholding and protecting, the core values of our society, and in the process, weakening our resolve and national strength.  The article concludes by proposing that the emergence of the ""enemy combatant"" as a new ""governmentality,"" or new political construct by which political power is organized and asserted, threatens not only those most immediately in danger, such as non-citizens and aliens, but also those previously thought to be safe from such an emaciation of rights and legal protections."
"March 26, 2008","Using novel quantitative historical data on 2,483 British privateering cruises, we show that state-licensed commerce raiding by merchants was not only a popular and potentially flourishing business, but also effective in harming enemy trade during the long eighteenth century (1688-1815). Why, then, did privateering merchants gradually turn away from the enterprise, despite their success? We provide systematic evidence that the expansion of overseas trade and ensuing decline in the revenues of commerce raiding facilitated the decline of British privateering and the transition to a full public provision of sea power by the Royal Navy by the end of the Napoleonic War."
"March 26, 2008","Among the reasons that states comply with international law in the absence of coercive enforcement mechanisms is a concern for their reputation for compliance with international legal rules.  Such a reputation is valuable because it allows states to make credible commitments to one another in an effort to overcome problems of cooperation.  To date neither the international relations nor the international law literature has developed a theory of reputation that explains in detail how states acquire a reputation for compliance, how they lose it, and how it affects behavior.  This paper seeks to provide such a theory.  It examines how states' reputation for compliance can be gained or lost and how reputational concerns interact with other payoffs.  It considers strategic decisions states must make to manage reputation over time as well as the connection between better information and more effective reputational sanctions.  Finally, the paper discusses the question of whether states have a single reputation for compliance with international law or, instead, several such reputations corresponding to different issue areas.  The way in which this compartmentalization of reputation influences the ability of states to solve international problems is explained."
"March 26, 2008","This paper analyzes the role of the unanimity rule - known as liberum veto - in medieval Poland. We argue that the primary effect of the liberum veto was that it secured religious freedom and established domestic peace in an otherwise deeply divided and fractionalised country. What is more, this institution succeeded in doing so during an era which was characterized by violent religious conflicts and rise of absolutist monarchies throughout the European continent. Even after 1652, when the liberum veto seemed to have practically paralyzed the decision-making of Polish-Lithuanian parliament, there were still reasons-related to religious issues - why its use could have been preferable to less inclusive voting rules. It can be argued, however, that the use of unanimity was not warranted in questions related to defense, especially in situations of national emergency, although it is questionable to which extent the sole presence of the liberum veto was susceptible to bring about the demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Republic."
"March 25, 2008","We consider a differential game of a conflict between two factions who both have a desire to exact revenge. We show that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, the desire for revenge need not lead to escalation of conflicts. Surprisingly, in the open-loop equilibrium, the weaker faction exerts a higher effort when the stronger faction's military capability increases. This result is not possible in the absence of a desire for revenge. The closed-loop equilibrium is characterized by a self-deterrence effect: Anticipating the future retaliation of the opponent, a faction has an incentive to exert lower effort today. This strengthens the tendency to a stable steady state and paradoxically may decrease the factions' effort below the levels exerted in the case without revenge. We discuss some applications of our results and also offer an explanation of a puzzling empirical result obtained by Jaeger and Paserman (2007) in their study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We also discuss the implications of revenge-dependent preferences for welfare economics and their strategic value as commitment devices."
"March 24, 2008","D.C. v. Heller, currently pending before the Supreme Court, is already being hailed as the most important Second Amendment case in history.  It is my contention, however, that Heller's resolution of the existing circuit split will almost certainly have little practical effect nationwide on gun policy.  The reason is simple:  The persistent and always tense debate over gun rights has thinly veiled underlying racial and socio-political struggles that are as old as the Union itself. In this article, I argue that the greatest legacy of Heller will lie not in its interpretation of the constitutional right to bear arms, but rather its potential to generate a reformed conversation about gun policy and its racial implications."
"March 20, 2008","The paper consider whether there is a need to react to cyber-terrorism and if so, to what extent? The first step in the argument is to overlay a principled framework on any legal initiative. This task also requires a critical scrutiny of the definitions of cyber-terrorism. Moving from definitions to typologies, the variants of cyber-terrorism are examined and include both the ancillary and offensive. Categories include: Information Warfare; Communications; Personnel and Logistical Support; Intelligence Gathering; Propaganda. There is then consideration of the legal responses under the following headings: Hostile Cyber-Attack; Support Cyber-Activities. The foregoing survey suggests that there are few legal gaps and that the difficulties of prosecution are often evidential rather than substantive. Consideration is also given to infrastructure and institutional responses. There is finally the encouragement of engagement which should take place in cyberspace, since it has become one of the front lines in the fight against terrorism."
"March 13, 2008","Do ideas drawn from the social movement literature travel well once we leave the democratic West? Research on protest in contemporary China shows that familiar concepts can be applied to China, and can also modify or question ideas that do not square with the realities of an authoritarian, non-western state. To this point, the biggest payoffs of studying popular contention in China have been: new ways of thinking about political opportunities, mobilizing structures, and framing. There remain three important gaps, however, in the study of Chinese collective action, all of which are places where future research can contribute to the understandings of contentious politics: 1) activism and the upwardly mobilie, 2) international influences, and 3) repression."
"March 10, 2008","Are insurgents affected by new information about the United States' sensitivity to costs? Using data on attacks and variation in access to international news across Iraqi provinces, we identify an ""emboldenment"" effect by comparing the rate of insurgent attacks in areas with higher and lower access to information about U.S news after public statements critical of the war. We find that in periods after a spike in war-critical statements, insurgent attacks increases by 7-10 percent, but that this effect dissipates within a month. Additionally, we find that insurgents shift attacks from Iraqi civilian to U.S. military targets following new information about the United States' sensitivity to costs, resulting in more U.S. fatalities but fewer deaths overall. These results suggest that there is a small but measurable cost to open public debate in the form of higher attacks in the short-term, and that Iraqi insurgent organizations - even those motivated by religious or ideological goals - are strategic actors that respond rationally to the expected probability of US withdrawal. However, the implied costs of open, public debate must be weighed against the potential gains. We conclude that to the extent insurgent groups respond rationally to the incentives set by the policies of pro-government forces, effective counterinsurgency should prioritize manipulating costs and inducements, rather than focus simply on search and destroy missions."
"March 09, 2008","Rural protest leaders in China play a number of roles.  Among others, they lead the charge, shape collective claims, recruit activists and mobilize the public, devise and orchestrate acts of contention, and organize cross-community efforts.  Protest leaders emerge in two main ways.  Long-time public figures initiate popular action on their own or in response to requests from other villagers; ordinary villagers evolve into protest leaders when efforts to seek redress for a personal grievance fail.  Rural officials sometimes attempt to co-opt or buy off protest leaders, but more often turn to repression.  Although cracking down may inhibit further contention, at other times it firms up the determination of protest leaders and makes them more prone to adopt confrontational tactics, partly by enhancing their popular support, partly by increasing the costs of withdrawal."
"March 07, 2008","As nations struggling to heal wounds of civil war and atrocity turn toward the model of reconciliation, Reconciliation in Divided Societies takes a systematic look at the political dimensions of this international phenomenon. . . . The book shows us how this transformation happens so that we can all gain a better understanding of how, and why, reconciliation really works. It is an almost indispensable tool for those who want to engage in reconciliation from the foreword by Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu."
"March 05, 2008","What is the political legacy of violent conflict? This paper presents evidence for a link between war, violence and increased individual political participation and leadership among former combatants and victims of violence, and uses this link to understand the deeper determinants of individual political behavior. The setting is northern Uganda, where rebel recruitment methods generated quasi-experimental variation in who became a rebel conscript and who did not. Original survey data shows that the exogenous element of conscription (by abduction) leads to significantly greater political participation later in life. The principal determinant of this increased political participation, moreover, appears to be war violence experienced. Meanwhile, abduction and violence do not appear to affect multiple non-political types of community participation. I show that these patterns are not easily explained by models of participation based on simple rational preferences, social preferences, mobilization by elites, or information availability. Only 'expressive' theories of participation appear consistent with the patterns observed, whereby exposure to violence augments the value a person places on the act of political expression itself. The implications for general theories of political participation are discussed."
"March 04, 2008","China has seen a surge of working class protests in recent years. Many of these protests have involved retirees. Pensioners are found to be particularly prone to take to the streets because their grievances are intense and are widely-perceived to be legitimate, they are ""biographically available,"" and they often feel nostalgic for aspects of the Maoist past. Their actions also display elements of moral economic resistance. This article draws on the available literature as well as interviews with 30 workers, retirees, laid-off workers, managers, and local  officials in five cities."
"March 04, 2008","The end of the world as we know it."
"March 04, 2008","This article examines the dynamics of administrative litigation in rural China. It shows how local officials often attempt to preempt, derail or undermine administrative lawsuits by blocking access to official documents and regulations, pressuring courts to reject cases, failing to appear in court or perjuring themselves, discrediting attorneys, and intimidating litigants.  It also discusses, however, how villagers fight back by drawing in sympathetic elites (such as people's congress deputies and the media) and mobilizing collective appeals and staging public protests. The paper concludes that administrative litigation provides a useful window on Chinese state-society relations and on the interplay of legal and political mobilization.  It also suggests that should more villagers incorporate administrative litigation into their repertoire of contention, a reform designed to extend the life of an authoritarian regime may play a part in nudging China a step closer to rule of law."
"March 04, 2008","Do superpower interventions to install and prop up political leaders in other countries subsequently result in more or less democracy, and does this effect vary depending on whether the intervening superpower is democratic or authoritarian? While democracy may be expected to decline contemporaneously with superpower interference, the effect on democracy after a few years is far from obvious. The absence of reliable information on covert interventions has hitherto served as an obstacle to seriously addressing these questions. The recent declassification of Cold War CIA and KGB documents now makes it possible to systematically address these questions in the Cold War context. We thus develop a new panel dataset of superpower interventions during the Cold War. We find that superpower interventions are followed by significant declines in democracy, and that the substantive effects are large. Perhaps surprisingly, once endogeneity is addressed, US and Soviet interventions have equally detrimental effects on the subsequent level of democracy; both decrease democracy by about 33%. Our findings thus suggest that one should not expect significant differences in the adverse institutional consequences of superpower interventions based on whether the intervening superpower is a democracy or a dictatorship."
"March 03, 2008","This paper analyses the humanitarian crisis in Nepal during the period of armed conflicts from the perspectives of International Humanitarian Law. Nepal, a Himalayan Kingdom until recently, was facing armed conflicts from communist rebels. The war prolonged for almost 12 years killing more than 13000 people. Too many human rights violations and ignorance of humanitarian law principles in the course of conflicts had become the rule of the day."
"March 03, 2008","With no discernible comedic intent, a number of lawyers and law professors have reprised roles from Stanley Kubrick's famous film, Dr. Strangelove, or:  How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.  Insisting that the war on terror is too important to be left to anyone other than the President, scorning opponents of torture as sissies afraid to muss their hair, and rapidly collecting promotions and personal citations, these lawyers are teaching America to stop worrying and love the waterboard - and the wiretap, and the ethnic profiling, and the indefinite detention, and all the other strategies of our new war that might be funny if they weren't so deadly serious.  This essay reviews Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, Terror in the Balance:  Security, Liberty, and the Courts (Oxford University Press, 2007)."
"February 29, 2008","The scale and intensity of the appropriation of Iraqi oil revenue makes the 2003 invasion one of the most audacious and spectacular crimes of theft in modern history. The institutionalisation of corporate corruption that followed the invasion can only be understood within the context of the coalition forces' contempt for universal principles of international law enshrined in the Hague and Geneva treaties. Neo-liberal shock therapy imposed on Iraq by the Anglo-American government of occupation provided momentum to an economic order which privileged the primacy and autonomy of market actors over laws intended to enshrine universal protections for civilian populations in war and conflict. As the US government-appointed auditor has subsequently established, an unknown proportion of Iraqi oil revenue has disappeared into the pockets of contractors and fixers in the form of bribery, over-charging, embezzlement, product substitution, bid rigging and false claims. At least $12 billion of the revenue appropriated by the coalition regime has not been adequately accounted for. This neo-liberal strategy of economic colonization was facilitated by major violations of the international laws of conflict and by unilaterally granting immunity from prosecution to US personnel. The suspension of the normal rule of law by the occupying powers, in turn, encouraged Coalition Provisional Authority tolerance of, and participation in, the theft of public funds in Iraq. State-corporate criminality in the case of occupied Iraq must therefore be understood as part of a wider strategy of political and economic domination."
"February 29, 2008","Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. However, the occupation is still continuing. The United Kingdom, a party to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), actively took part in this war and still controls certain parts of Iraq. Allegations that British forces had violated international humanitarian law were raised during and after the war. This article discusses whether the ECHR provides a mechanism to examine those allegations. It is considered that this discussion should be carried out under the light of a recent admissibility decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECrtHR), given in the Bankovic case, in which the ECrtHR found that the NATO attacks against Yugoslavia fall out of the extraterritorial reach of the ECHR. The first argument of the article is that the way in which the ECrtHR interprets the term `jurisdiction` in the Bankovic case is flawed. It is contended that the ECrtHR should reexamine its observations on jurisdiction, if an application concerning the conduct of British forces in the Iraqi war was brought before the court. Secondly, the article maintains that as the situation in Iraq is different from the one in Kosovo, the ECHR should apply to the region under the control of the UK. Indeed, while the Bankovic case only concerned aerial bombardment of Serbia, the ECrtHR might face various complaints emanating from the use of ground forces and belligerent occupation in Iraq."
"February 29, 2008","The cases on Chechnya recently decided by the European Court of Human Rights force us to re-evaluate the relationship between human rights law and humanitarian law. Since the International Court of Justice held that humanitarian law is lex specialis to human rights law in 1996 - if not since the Tehran Conference of 1968 - it has been widely accepted that `human rights in armed conflict` refers to humanitarian law. The ECtHR has directly applied human rights law to the conduct of hostilities in internal armed conflicts. The rules it has applied may prove controversial, but humanitarian law`s limited substantive scope and poor record of achieving compliance in internal armed conflicts suggest the importance of this new approach."
"February 29, 2008","Many of the world`s refugees have fled their homeland due to armed conflict. Added to this is the number of persons internally displaced in conflict zones. Even lawful tactics of armed conflict can force people to leave their home, their family and possessions. Unlawful tactics of ethnic cleansing intentionally exacerbate population displacement. Whether internally or externally displaced, many of the effects are the same - loss of family, possessions and home. However, while the effects are similar, the legal position of the two is very different. Forced to flee their homeland, refugees are vulnerable, so much so that they have been made the subject of international protection regimes. Internally displaced persons, on the other hand, remain within the state and the governmental protections that that brings. Whilst the two may only be physically separated across a state border by a few metres, the legal positions are an ocean apart."
"February 29, 2008","Although many international instruments provide for or make reference to a duty of states to afford remedies for gross violations of human rights or international crimes, normally, such instruments refrain from granting individuals a right to compensation, but rather enjoin the competent domestic bodies (the legislature as well as the judiciary) to ensure such right. This is because international lawmakers are well aware of the difficulties that would be raised by individual reparation claims based on international law. Reparation and, in particular, compensation must always be synchronized with the societal context of the relevant occurrences. This is all the more necessary since, contrary to what the UN Commission of Inquiry on Darfur has stated, there is no customary international rule governing individual reparation claims. On the other hand, to date, no general international forum for the assertion of such claims has come into being. Consequently, even proceedings involving `international` claims would have to be instituted before national tribunals, whereas in classical interstate relationships, domestic tribunals are never vested with jurisdiction - except in instances where the litigant parties so decide by mutual agreement."

"February 29, 2008","While the 1951 Convention is no longer limited geographically and its definition of a refugee is not linked to any particular crisis or place, the source of persecution and the role of the state with respect thereto has proved problematic. Domestic violence claims have suffered particularly because of these shortcomings, as these cases have been uneasy fits within doctrine. Though the Convention definition ordinarily envisions the state as persecutor, domestic violence follows a different course. Almost inevitably, its victims are persecuted by their husbands. As `non-state actors`, they have frequently and wrongly eluded the Convention norms, revealing a tragic protection gap in the Convention. An asylum seeker must prove that she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Despite the seriousness of the claim, if the reason for the threat does not lie in one of those five sources, a proper asylum claim has not been made. Worse, however, the source of the persecution, a non-state actor, often blocks Convention protection. This paper will analyze these stumbling blocks to asylum seekers. It will posit the notion that legitimate asylum seekers have been marginalized by their home countries, rendered virtual non-citizens. Whether through complicity, neglect or sheer indifference or incompetence, these home countries are `failed states`, failures in not having provided full rights of citizenship throughout their populations. In conjunction with that, it will examine the standards for determining when the non-state actor is a persecutor within the Convention sense. Finally, it will set out factors to be used to test the failed state for litigation purposes."
"February 29, 2008","This paper explores the range of strategies employed by states to obfuscate their responsibility in state crime through 'othering' both perpetrators and victims. It draws upon a range of frameworks of international humanitarian law, human rights, transitional justice as well as criminological theory to explore the historical and contemporary techniques of obfuscation. The first part of the article focuses upon the ways in which state agency is either exercised covertly or by proxy. Strategies include 'resort to perfidy', the expanded use of 'specialist' forces, collusion with indigenous paramilitaries and the use of private-sector mercenaries and military firms to outsource state deviance. The second part of the article then examines the 'othering' of the enemies of the state. These strategies include holding detainees outside national territories, using third-party nations to carry out torture or redefining the status of individuals to designate them as juridical 'others', with few national or international legal protections. The authors conclude that the notion of state crime should move beyond a monolithic conceptualization of the state and that a more subtle grasp of the different modalities of proxy agency and othering encourages us to look beyond retributive-centred international and national criminal law as but one of the mechanisms for attributing responsibility for state deviance"
"February 29, 2008","When the US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was disbanded in 2003 many of its components were absorbed into the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS). One of these new entities, called US Citizenship and Immigration (USCIS), now has the formidable task of processing and keeping track of all the applicants for entry into the United States. Its goal is to serve the immigrant community effectively, efficiently, and fairly, while avoiding the problems and deserved criticisms of its predecessor organization. USCIS is expected to achieve this goal under the administrative authority of DHS that has goals that may not be compatible. The primary mission of DHS is to fight terrorism, and providing good service to clients may be incidental. In this reorganization many members of the immigrant community fear they are viewed as potential terrorists. That it also has responsibility for refugee applicants raises the issue of the blurring of immigration and asylum - the former is about control whereas the latter should be focused on protection. The possible effects of these organizational changes on immigrants, refugees, and the nation are reviewed in this paper."
"February 29, 2008","The author argues that the Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, in excluding any genocidal intent in the Government authorities of the Sudan, while leaving open the possibility for individual state officials or members of militias to entertain such intent, did not duly take into account the various views on genocidal intent put forward in legal literature. In the author`s opinion, genocide - typically, that is, for all practical purposes - requires a collective activity of a group, state or entity - activity in which individual perpetrators participate. As for the genocidal intent of individual perpetrators - in this typical scenario, according to the author - one should distinguish between (i) the view, upheld by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), as well as the Commission of Inquiry, that such intent is the aim physically to destroy a protected group, and (ii) the more correct view that such intent consists of the individual`s (a) knowledge of a genocidal campaign and (b) at least dolus eventualis as regards the at least partial destruction of a protected group. This legal construction of genocidal intent does not, however, lead to conclusions substantially different from those reached by the Commission of Inquiry with regard to the mental attitude of the Sudanese Government and militias: as they did not act pursuant to a collective goal to destroy a protected group, no genocidal intent could materialize. However, contrary to the Commission`s conclusions, it follows from this proposition that no genocidal intent could be found either if, in some instances, single individuals were held to have acted with the desire to see the protected group destroyed. For, in this event, the two requirements for individual genocidal intent would be lacking, namely knowledge of a genocidal campaign (on the premise that no such campaign was carried out), and a fortiori dolus eventualis."
"February 29, 2008","States entering into international agreements have at their disposal several tools to enhance the strength and credibility of their commitments, including the ability to make the agreement a formal treaty rather than soft law, provide for mandatory dispute resolution procedures, and establish monitoring mechanisms. Each of these strategies - referred to as `design elements` - increases the costs associated with the violation of an agreement and, therefore, the probability of compliance. Yet even a passing familiarity with international agreements makes it clear that states routinely fail to include these design elements in their agreements. This article explains why rational states sometimes prefer to draft their agreements in such a way as to make them less credible and, therefore, more easily violated. In contrast to domestic law, where contractual violations are sanctioned through zero-sum payments from the breaching party to the breached-against party, sanctions for violations of international agreements are not zero-sum. To the extent that sanctions exist, they almost always represent a net loss to the parties. For example, a reputational loss felt by the violating party yields little or no offsetting benefit to its counter-party. When entering into an agreement, then, the parties take into account the possibility of a violation and recognize that if it takes place, the net loss to the parties will be larger if credibility-enhancing measures are in place. In other words, the design elements offer a benefit in the form of greater compliance, but do so by increasing the cost to the parties in the event of a violation. When deciding which design elements to include, the parties must then balance the benefits of increased compliance against the costs triggered in the event of a violation."
"February 29, 2008","Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. immigration and refugee policy has developed based on narrow and evolving theories of `national security`. Immigration reform legislation, federal regulations, and administrative policy changes have been justified in terms of the nation`s safety. On 1 March 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was folded into the massive new U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), formally making immigration a homeland defense concern."
"February 28, 2008","The end of war does not necessarily signal a return to peace. The organization of a ceasefire or peace agreement, or even the implementation of processes such as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) or weapons reduction, does not necessarily guarantee improvements in the safety of either civilians or former combatants. In fact, many so-called 'post-conflict' environments yield even more direct and indirect threats to civilians than the 'armed conflicts' that preceded them. The 'post-conflict' designation actually disguises a vast array of threats facing many societies emerging from war, as recent experience in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti and the Great Lakes of Africa so painfully illustrates. The hubris that once accompanied the signing of peace accords and the shift to 'post-conflict' reconstruction has now been replaced by a weary pessimism. However, there are grounds for cautious optimism. Where DDR and weapons reduction are adequately prepared and implemented, societies are less likely to remain dangerous places."

"February 28, 2008","How is one to understand contentious acts that open channels of participation while also making use of existing channels? Rightful resistance is a partly institutionalized form of popular action that employs laws, policies, and other established values to defy power holders who have failed to live up to some ideal or who have not implemented a popular measure. Analysis of opposition to cadre misconduct in rural China, supported by evidence from the United States, Norway, and South Africa, suggests that resistance can share a common dynamic despite its occurrence in strikingly dissimilar settings. Aggrieved individuals and groups turn to established principles to anchor their defiance; use legitimating myths and normative language to frame their claims; rely on existing statutes and government commitments when leveling their charges; and locate and mobilize advocates within officialdom. In differing contexts, a combination of rights talk, legal tactics, and open confrontation may induce power holders to surrender advantages in accord with principles that usually favor them. The cases examined further suggest that rightful resistance springs from rights consciousness and increases it and, finally, that it may be more consequential than most ""everyday resistance"" while remaining less risky than wholly uninstitutionalized defiance."
"February 26, 2008","In studies of popular politics a split exists.  Some scholars focus on rather tame forms of participation while others become interested mainly when political action spills out onto the streets.  This article considers acts located near the boundary between official, prescribed politics and politics by other means.  It explores popular pressure that is arguably legal, permissible in some eyes but not in others.  The episodes of boundary-spanning contention examined center on implementing elections in rural China.  What is to be gained by investigating this form of contention?  First, it promises a better understanding of causal processes insofar as it draws attention to state and movement trajectories.  Second, it can help close the gap between analysts who study the dynamics of contention and those who are concerned with the consequences of contention.  Third, it promises to bring the relationship between states and contentious politics into clearer focus.  Finally, studying boundary-spanning acts can help locate a regime across a number of dimensions: what is institutionalized and what is not, what is participation and what is resistance, who is a challenger and who is a polity member, what citizenship entails and who enjoys it."
"February 26, 2008","Protest outcomes in rural China are typically an outgrowth of interaction between activists, sympathetic elites, targets and the wider public.  Popular agitation first alerts concerned officials to poor policy implementation and may prompt them to take corrective steps.  As a result of participating in contention certain activists feel empowered and become more likely to take part in future challenges, while others feel disillusioned and lapse into passivity.  In the course of observing collective action, some onlookers are sensitized to protester's concerns and public opinion is affected.  Without popular action, better implementation, biographical change, and effects on the public would not emerge, but nor would they without involvement from above.  Studying the impact of protest in rural China thus sheds light on two issues that have long troubled students of contentious politics: 1) how to get a grip on indirect, mediated consequences, and 2) how to think about causality when change is a result both of popular action and openings provided by sympathetic elites."
"February 26, 2008","Post-September 11 legal events have demonstrated that ideological agendas distort the deliberation required for sound advice about national security.  Legal issue entrepreneurs who market a theory without context exalt short-term interests and encourage executive unilateralism.  These perils have emerged in a number of recent developments, including the torture memos drafted by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) and the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes."
"February 22, 2008","Using French and Raven's (1959) bases of social power, leadership is defined in terms of a dependency between leader and follower.  The authors show how referrent and expert power are critical to the ascientific construct of leadership in predicting the extent to which trust can be created within organizational relationships.  Using popular press reports of religious bias within military organizations, the authors illustrate how using one's religious values as a proxy for organizational values not only create a divisive organizational climate, but are counter to the mandates set forth by the US Constitution.  The authors introduce the Oath of Equal Character as a potential remedy to the pervasive religiousity noted in government organizations across the US Armed Forces and advocate how the appropriate creation and judicious use of referrent power is chiefly responsible for the emergence of trusting relationships in military organizations."
"February 22, 2008","Thomas Schelling was recognized by the Nobel Prize committee as a pioneer in the development of noncooperative game theory and its application to problems of politics and international relations. One of his principal concerns was how a country could engage in successful deterrence. If the assumptions of rationality and common knowledge are taken seriously, however, nuclear adversaries are almost certain to engage in devastating conflict. The history of the last half century falsifies this prediction, and Schelling's Nobel lecture took as its subject the event that didn't occur. Where does this leave us? Schelling's advancement of formal theory has been limited, and his attempted application to nuclear strategy incoherent, requiring appeals to agent rationality and irrationality. Given the conflicting predispositions that govern human action, and the wedge sometimes created between theoretical predictions and behavior, we will be better served, normatively and predictively, by adopting a more empirically oriented behavioral approach."
"February 21, 2008","In order to be able to devise successful strategies for destabilizing terrorist organizations it is vital to recognize and understand their structural properties. This paper deals with the optimal communication structure of terrorist organizations when considering the tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency. We use elements from game theory and graph theory to determine the 'optimal' communication structure a covert network should adopt. Every covert organization faces the constant dilemma of staying secret and ensuring the necessary coordination between its members. For several different secrecy and information scenarios this dilemma is modeled as a game theoretic bargaining problem over the set of connected graphs of given order. Assuming uniform exposure probability of individuals in the network we show that the Nash bargaining solution corresponds to either a network with a central individual (the star graph) or an all-to-all network (the complete graph) depending on the link detection probability, which is the probability that communication between individuals will be detected. If the probability that an individual is exposed as member of the network depends on the information hierarchy determined by the structure of the graph, the Nash bargaining solution corresponds to cellular-like networks."
"February 14, 2008","Over the past two decades, Western political leaders have scripted a more ethical foreign policy, wherein far greater weight is given to protecting the rights and freedoms of extra-territorial citizens. Using the example of arms exports to developing countries, the present paper exposes the organized hypocrisy underlying countries’ self-declared ethical turn. We show that the major Western arms supplying states – France, Germany, the UK and the US – have generally not exercised export controls so as to discriminate against human rights abusing or autocratic countries during the post-Cold War period. Rather, we uncover ongoing territorial egoism, in that arms have been exported to countries which serve supplying states’ domestic economic and security interests."
"February 11, 2008","Interdependence is ubiquitous, and often central, across political economy. In comparative political economy, for example, globalization and rising capital mobility imply tax competition that suggests the fiscal policies of one country must depend crucially upon those of other countries with which it competes for capital. In international political economy, to give another example, security concerns and the global structure of military alliances are likely to make trade flows interdependent across country dyads. We explain how any situation that involves externalities from one unit's actions on others' implies interdependence and show how to model such interdependent processes empirically. We discuss how to estimate properly specified interdependence models with spatial lags by maximum likelihood and how to interpret and present the resulting estimated spatio-temporal effects, response paths, and long-run steady-states, with their associated standard errors. We illustrate with replications of two noteworthy earlier studies from comparative and international political economy."
"February 11, 2008","Basic thermodynamic calculations lead to the reliable result that the primary energy consumption (PEC) is the main origin of the observed temperature increase of the earth climate. The CO2 greenhouse gas influence plays comparably no decisive role. Based on the second law of thermodynamics the entropy changes since 1750 were calculated up to 2100 considering the exponential increase of the world primary energy consumption PEC and the exponential growth of the world population, taking into account the so called greenhouse factor Beta for the radiation equilibrium earth atmosphere/outer space and the energetic efficiency Zeta. The calculations result in an exceptional increase of world temperature. A revision of the world temperature and sea level prognoses etc. published so far by the IPCC is absolutely necessary. It is pointed out that this temperature increase is entirely independent of the fuel type, i.e. fossil oder renewable. Based on the thermodynamic results and the relaxation time of the CO2 it is almost impossible to reduce the earth surface temperature with the so far planned mitigation measures for reducing CO2 within the time given for man. The only possible measures to save live on earth will be a radical cut down of the consumption of primary energy of the world, both fossil energy as well as renewable energy. A method to limit the use of primary energy could be the introduction of an entropy tax on the basis of a world wide philosophy of an Entropy Identity."
"February 06, 2008","Politics can influence arms trade through several channels, and history indicates that it actually does: throughout the XXth century arms have not only been tradable goods, but also foreign policy instruments. This paper focuses on countries supplying major conventional weapons (MCW), and investigates whether the political orientation of the government in power makes any difference to arms export policy. In particular, I concentrate on democratic exporters to check how the government's political orientation, right-wing or left-wing, has an impact on the quantity of arms supplied to third countries. For this purpose, a bilateral trade equation is estimated for the years 1975-2004 by applying a panel TOBIT framework. Results suggest that the exporter's chief executive being right-wing has a positive and significant impact on MCW exports. This may reflect a general right-wing tendency to lower trade barriers, with its consequences on the deregularization of heavy industry exports, or a higher economic support towards the armament sector as a relevant part of national industry."
"February 04, 2008","Why do some countries' economies recover from civil conflicts more quickly than others? We contend that the key to economic recovery is a credible commitment to the peace. In turn, the ability of political actors to eschew further violence credibly depends on the nature of the political institutional transition a country must make. We test these arguments with duration analysis of an original dataset of economic recovery from civil conflict. Among key results, we find that post-conflict democratization retards recovery, reinforcing a growing pessimism among political scientists regarding the challenges new democracies face after civil conflicts."
"January 29, 2008","Though it is well known that Frantz Fanon was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre, and that Sartre was a supporter of Fanon, little attention has been paid to the conflict that existed between their respective views on the violence they lived through and wrote about. In ""Paris under the Occupation"", Sartre tries to explain to the reader what it felt like to live under the rule of an enemy whose omnipresence forced the aggression and hostility of the French back against themselves, leaving them both defeated and ashamed. Yet in ""The Wretched of The Earth"", to prove to the world that the suffering of the Algerians was so great as to not only create their murderous rage but to justify its use, Fanon makes an example of the occupation to show that it was nothing compared to colonialism. By exploring this tension between these accounts, this paper will study Sartre's existential analyses of occupation and Fanon's psychiatric diagnoses of colonization so that we can see where these accounts actually intersect. This will allow us to better understand what violence can do to anyone forced to live under its rule."
"January 29, 2008","Transnational security threats challenge the state-centric premises on which the UN system operates. Since many transnational security challenges emerge out of social behaviors traditionally hidden behind state walls and beyond the control of the UN, states are often reluctant to address them in multilateral frameworks. The cross-cutting nature of transnational security threats defies the institutional silo structure within the UN system. The UN nevertheless has some comparative advantages in addressing these challenges, due to its convening power, its ability to generate legitimacy through universal participation, and the technical expertise and capacity located in its secretariat, agencies, and field operations. The paper closes with a series of recommendations for effective response."
"January 26, 2008","There is a long history of laws responding to terrorism which have been utilised in the United Kingdom. This paper outlines the important strands of development, including in former colonies of the British Empire, in Ireland, and in mainland Britain itself. It offers an outline of the contemporary legislation - the Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and the Terrorism Act 2006. These comprise a formidably detailed and complex code of measures, principally concentrating upon special police powers, offences and criminal processes, the proscription of organisations and the restriction of financial flows to terrorists. The paper then considers thematically some of the main controversies surrounding the laws. The discussion is organised around the following binaries: a rational code not panic legislation; a criminal justice model not a war model; the language of rights not the language of balance; international cooperation not unilateralism; appropriate structures not empty acronyms. The conclusions warn against undue optimism about the impact of the special laws and undue reliance upon the laws to an extent which damages the very values which the laws seek to protect."
"January 26, 2008","The anticipatory risk of mass terrorism casualties or even the nightmare of the use of weapons of mass destruction conduces towards interventions which are preemptive or preventative. The threat of terrorism to life and liberty cannot be addressed simply by ex post facto rectification for the sake of justice.  An inevitable consequence of this risk dynamic will be an intelligence-led approach, that is, governmental net-casting for information and for potential assailants on a wide and prescient scale.  Several measures in U.K. law could be considered as test cases of counter-terrorism control measures. Probably the most appropriate are the eponymous control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. The system imposed by the Act encompasses both operative dynamics: the imperative to respond to anticipatory risk and the need to extend action to the ""neighbor"" terrorist. Foremost in the inquiry will be the following questions: what circumstances gave rise to the policy of control orders; what are the main elements of the policy and how is it implemented; is it possible to maintain constitutionalism when dealing with a non-criminal justice mechanism of this kind; and, what lessons can be derived for future policy?"
"January 26, 2008","The definition of 'terrorism' has long been controversial in legal discourse, so much so that the Government has instituted a review by Lord Carlile. Attempts to date have often resulted in vague formulations which bring charges of uncertainty and excessive police and prosecutorial discretion. In United Kingdom law, examples include police powers to arrest and stop and search, as well as offences concerning the glorification of terrorism. This paper explores how the definition has been developed in United Kingdom law, set against a background of comparable jurisdictions and international law. It advocates the 'scheduled offence in context' approach as a way of ensuring certainty and proportionality, as well as better complying with international law expectations and the overwhelming requirement for law to aid a return to normality rather than to impede it."
"January 21, 2008","In order to shed light on the process of radicalization (the adoption of violence for political ends), we constructed an agent-based computational simulation of a community in which radicalization occurs. In this simulated society we varied parameters such as community size, population homogeneity/diversity, and migration; examining how they affect the formation of self-starter radical cells. We have also looked at social venues, which we call ""magnets"", and modeled how they create new ties between agents. In agreement with case studies, we found that such venues radicalize even when they attract radicals and non-radicals alike. Additionally, we found that diversity reduces radicalization but population size has little effect. By understanding how radical cells form, the model facilitates better prediction of terrorist-cell formation and suggests possible counter-radicalization policies."
"January 17, 2008","Central to recent debates about international cooperation has been the contention that if states seek relative gains, cooperation becomes more difficult. To help revive and redirect the debate, we provide a general treatment of the relative-gains argument in the simplest possible formal terms. The analysis enables us to make two arguments which challenge starkly pessimistic conclusions and define when and how relative-gains concerns affect outcomes. First, if states bargain over the terms of agreement, all positional concerns will be reflected in the bargained outcome and cooperation should remain possible. In the Nash-bargaining model, mutual concern for positionality makes the outcome more symmetric while differential concerns result in agreements biased so as to appease the more positionally concerned state. Second, employing basic game theory, we show that 2x2 games will transform into deadlock as concern for positionality increases only where three necessary conditions on the payoff structure of the original game are satisfied. Hence, while the relative-gains problem can affect cooperation in international relations, it does so only under specific conditions and in specific ways which can be identified theoretically and researched empirically."
"January 17, 2008","In this paper, we discuss the substantive range of spatial interdependence in political and related social sciences. We offer a generic theoretical model demonstrating that interdependence arises whenever utilities of one actor depend on the choices of other actors - i.e., inter alia, in all strategic settings. We discuss Galton's problem of distinguishing empirically spatial correlation from spatial interdependence, and then we introduce, demonstrate, and discuss the specification and estimation of spatial and spatio-temporal models, the spatial probit model of binary-outcomes, spatial-model testing, and the presentation of estimated spatial and spatio-temporal effects with certainty estimates."
"January 17, 2008","Some of the most important phenomena in international conflict are coded s ""rare events data,"" binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer events, such as wars, coups, etc., than ""nonevents"". Unfortunately, rare events data are difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, and most importantly, the data collection strategies used in international conflict are grossly inefficient. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of non-events (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99% of their (non-fixed) data collection costs, or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. Second, logistic regression, and other commonly used statistical procedures, can underestimate the probability of rare events. We introduce some corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. We also provide easy-to-use methods and software that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously."
"January 17, 2008","We address a well-known but infrequently discussed problem in the quantitative study of international conflict: Despite immense data collections, prestigious journals, and sophisticated analyses, empirical findings in the literature on international conflict are often unsatisfying. Many statistical results change from article to article and specification to specification. Accurate forecasts are nonexistant. In this article we offer a conjecture about one source of this problem: The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but they are large, stable, and replicable wherever the ex ante probability of conflict is large. This simple idea has an unexpectedly rich array of observable implications, all consistent with the literature. We directly test our conjecture by formulating a statistical model that includes critical features. Our approach, a version of a ""neural network"" model, uncovers some interesting structural features of international conflict, and as one evaluative measure, forecasts substantially better than any previous effort. Moreover, this improvement comes at little cost, and it is easy to evaluate whether the model is a statistical improvement over the simpler models commonly used."
"January 16, 2008","Continuous violent conflict is a central cause of economic stagnation in many of the world’s poorest countries. Given that attempts to achieve peace in these countries often remain elusive, it is important to identify mechanisms which reveal the sustainability of peace over time. We argue that long-term financial asset values reflect the sustainability of peace prospects because the expectation of continued peace will result in higher long term asset prices. Equity index prices from Sri Lanka are used to test this theory. Also considered are the accuracy of equity prices versus other predictors of sustainable peace, including exchange rates and survey responses. The main conclusion is that long-term financial asset prices indicate the likelihood of conflict or peace and can inform"
"January 16, 2008","Reconstruction involves military occupation with the aim of rebuilding and reforming both formal and informal institutions along liberal democratic lines. We contend that successful reconstructions require mechanisms which make reforms credible over the long-run. In the absence of a signal of sustained credible commitment, institutional reforms will not be trusted by the populace resulting in the failure of the broader reconstruction. The incentive, information and epistemic aspects of the credible commitment problem are analyzed. We also consider potential solutions to the problem of credible commitment. Absent such solutions, attempts to ""export"" institutions via military occupation should be either limited in their scope or curtailed entirely."

"January 11, 2008","The explosion in the 21st century of terrorist activities by Islamic radicals in the United States, Europe and Asia requires reforming the institutions for domestic counterterrorism (CT) and new international relations among individual national CT organizations.  This paper discusses the institutional reforms for CT in the United States, focusing particularly on the changes in the FBI.  These changes are compared with the way that the British CT activities of the MI5 and MI6 have evolved in response to terrorism in Britain. The paper also discusses the reasons why there is strong cooperation among the CT activities of all the major governments and with the United States in particular, even when those governments do not agree about military cooperation or about the use of economic sanctions."
"January 11, 2008","Can rational choice modeling explain why Hamas, Taliban, Hezbollah and other radical religious rebels are so lethal? The literature rejects theological explanations. We propose a club framework, which emphasizes the function of voluntary religious organizations as efficient providers of local public goods in the absence of government provision. The sacrifices religious clubs require are economically efficient (Iannaccone (1992)), making them well suited for solving the extreme principal-agent problems faced by terrorist and insurgent organizations. Thus religious clubs can be potent terrorists. That explanation is supported by data on terrorist lethality in the Middle East. The same approach explains why religious clubs often choose suicide attacks. Using three data sources spanning a half century, and comparing suicide attackers to civil war insurgents, we show that suicide attacks are chosen when targets are ""hard,"" i.e., difficult to destroy. Data from Israel/Palestine confirm that prediction. To explain why radical religious clubs specialize in suicide attacks we model the choice of tactics by rebels attacking hard targets, considering the human costs and tactical benefits of suicide attacks. We ask what a suicide attacker would have to believe to be rational. We then embed that attacker and other operatives in a club model. The model has testable implications for tactic choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebels, which are supported by data on terrorist attacks in the Middle East: Radical religious clubs are more lethal and choose suicide terrorism more often, when they provide benign local public goods. Our results suggest benign tactics to counter terrorism by religious radicals."
"January 10, 2008","In discussing warfare we tend to maintain a theoretical cleavage between the ""home front"" and the ""battle front"" that is supposed to parallel the physical distance that separates them.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the academic literature that surrounds World War I, with each discipline for decades having studied its correspondent aspect of the war.  While this has provided us with incredibly detailed research into the minutiae of battles and the changing attitudes of the masses, it has done little to help us combine these details into a full-scale picture of what was actually experienced by civilians and soldiers alike.  Therefore this paper will instead attempt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding this war by looking at the alarmism that helped lead to the war and the censorship and propaganda campaigns that helped shape it.  Thus it will be shown that only by returning to the concerted efforts of politicians and journalists years before the war can we see how the ""war to end all war"" eventually led to the creation of ""shell shock"" and the loss of a generation."
"January 10, 2008","This review examines the persistence of chronic hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa in the twenty-first century and reviews dominant famine theories, concepts of vulnerability, and household livelihood security and responses to recent food crises in the region. The authors argue that famine occurrences are linked to historical and contemporary socioeconomic processes that have increased over time the vulnerability of African households to hunger and reduced their resilience to environmental and economic shocks, political conflict, and the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. Approaches to famine need to move away from the ""emergency relief"" framework to better address the underlying conditions that make food shortages endemic. Future food security for Africa requires an integrated long-term response to household vulnerability on the part of African governments, civil society, and international partners by incorporating new technologies, local expertise, and active involvement of African communities living with the realities of recurrent famine."
"January 10, 2008","The empirical literature on political Islam is fairly rich and getting better, but theoretical interpretations of these data are still quite primitive. This gap is a product of Orientalist traditions that ""essentialize"" Islamic movements, a resulting lack of appreciation for their global diversity, and the inevitable politicization of the subject matter. This essay seeks not only to identify the most important studies in the field but to show how they suggest a typology, chronology, and problematic that might lead to more fruitful analysis in the future."
"January 10, 2008","This essay explores governmental and scholarly responses to the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Both events caught intelligence analysts, military officers, and elected officials by surprise. This essay describes the differences between the two events, especially in the ways official inquiries have helped shape our understanding of why the surprise occurred. Before both events, data suggesting that attacks were possible or even probable were available within the ""intelligence pipeline."" The essay focuses on how scholars and official investigations reported and explained that finding. It also identifies continuities between the investigations that followed the Japanese and al Qaeda attacks on the United States."
"January 10, 2008","In the 1990s, simultaneous with a wave of democratization that proved only partially successful, Africa was swept by protracted civil conflicts, which had a number of novel attributes. The Great Lakes region-Congo-Kinshasa, Rwanda, and Burundi-was the epicenter. In their dynamics and demographics, the violent combats became interpenetrated, embroiling the three countries in intractable struggles. Their extraordinary complexity, and multiplicity of state and other actors, interrogated a number of distinct literatures. State decay and collapse, a broader phenomenon in Africa, was especially marked in Congo-Kinshasa. In all three countries, the irresistible pressures for democratization-which were part of a broader African pattern-triggered violent struggles over definitions of identity, citizenship, and indigeneity. The legal, moral, and analytical issue of genocide returned to the research agenda with a vengeance with the Rwandan catastrophe in 1994, and mass ethnic killings in Burundi and Congo-Kinshasa. The new dynamics of African civil wars and warlord politics demanded inquiry. Finally, the necessity of international intervention to contain and mediate the violence brought new attention to peacekeeping issues."

"January 06, 2008","Applies the post-Charter law of intervention by invitation to the official request by the Iraqi interim government - which was not fully sovereign at the time - that the United States and its allies maintain their military forces in Iraq."
"January 06, 2008","Examines the gacaca courts, a modified version of a traditional Rwandan justice institution, as a response to that country's genocide, evaluating not only the ability of the gacaca courts to satisfy standard criteria of effective transitional justice, but also whether the goals set out for the gacaca courts help or hinder Rwanda's goal of peaceful transition."
"December 21, 2007","State repression includes harassment, surveillance/spying, bans, arrests, torture, and mass killing by government agents and/or affiliates within their territorial jurisdiction. Over the past 40 years, the systematic study of state repression has grown considerably. The development of this work, however, has been uneven. Though unified in their focus on the problem of order (i.e., trying to ascertain how political authorities wield coercive power amid potential and actual domestic challengers), different scholars tend to emphasize distinct aspects of the topic. Consequently, a great deal of progress has been made in specific areas but others have lagged behind. In this review, I attempt to identify the dominant traditions in the repression literature, the core empirical findings, and some persisting puzzles."
"December 20, 2007","This essay was adapted from remarks at the 2006 Symposium, Gender, War & Peace: Women's Status in the Wake of Conflict, held at Michigan State University in 2006. As many of the contributions to the symposium demonstrate, women and girls experience particularized harms from armed conflict, including, for example, the psychological fall-out and physical damage of sex-related war crimes, the permanent displacement of women and children from their homes, and the destruction of families and livelihoods.  Redressing these harms through post-conflict accountability mechanisms is an important, but incomplete response. Peace processes - the informal and formal mechanisms through which wars are ended and transitions to post-war order are managed and regulated - may have longer term consequences for the welfare of women than the underlying armed conflicts.  Domestic and comparative studies tend to demonstrate that women behave differently from men within dispute resolution processes.  Given these differences, and because war carries particularly devastating effects for women and girls, efforts to end war and prevent the recurrence of armed conflict should systematically consider the role of women and include women as active participants in peace building."
"December 17, 2007","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a hitherto-obscure phenomenon in the criminal law. Law has, for too long, been ""marching with medicine, but in the rear, and limping a little.""  Yet, increasing awareness of the Disorder has prompted counsel to plead it in both civil and criminal proceedings. It is, perhaps, unsurprising that this disease, which was once prevalent as ""shell shock,"" is the modern scourge of Canada's military obligations abroad.  When Canadian Forces (CF) personnel return home, they are often not debriefed, nor provided with adequate mental health services. This neglect sows a ticking time bomb in Canadian homes; when the time is up, the explosion is sometimes violent, and criminal charges are laid. Yet, PTSD is not germane to only soldiers; sexual assault victims, and disaster survivors often suffer from the Disorder. However, because combat veterans often suffer more severe PTSD, and suffer it more prevalently, they will be the focus in this analysis.  This paper will demonstrate that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder can form the basis of a successful Defence of Mental Disorder  (Not Criminally Responsible, or NCR)  in criminal proceedings."
"December 13, 2007","Prior to Saddam Hussein's fall the tensions over the waters of the Tigris-Euphrates River basin reached internationally acknowledged levels, and a lack of cooperation among the riparians, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, confronted the world with a new potential conflict area. This situation threatened the delicate political stability in the Middle East, and further polarization in the region continues today.  In terms of water allocation the basin is one of the most unstable political areas in the region and in this extremely arid environment water plays an important role.  This is a classic case of water quantity problem, which manifests itself in a struggle for use of the available water in the basin.  I then assess the geography and hydrography of the Tigris-Euphrates River Basin.  It then assesses how the damming of the two rivers by each of the three riparians, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, has altered the hydrological balance.  In particular I examine Turkey's GAP dams, which are situated in eastern Anatolia, near the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.  One then reviews the historical conflict in the Basin and also explores past avenues of cooperation, including treaty making.  The article then proposes a framework solution to the deadlock, via the use of international law.  As part of this section I explore the development of equitable principle of water use; the doctrine of equitable utilization and water management principles within the context of Tigris-Euphrates River Basin conflict.  One then assess solutions that have either been considered or are extant to determine whether these may offer a pacific solution to the transboundary allocation of water in the Basin. Some of these solutions include, a proposal offered by The League of Arab States; a model for a unified plan; the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty; the Oslo II Israeli-Palestinian Water Agreement; the Boundary Waters Treaty's JWC framework as a ""management"" body for allocating water and governing future disputes and allocations."
"December 12, 2007","Climate change presents the greatest collective action problem the international community has yet confronted. The unequal distribution of expected costs and benefits from climate change (based on mean damage estimates from probability distribution functions) creates different incentives for different countries, which can be expected to bargain in their own perceived interests. Unresolved collective action problems explain the notorious flaws in the Kyoto Protocol, and continue to impede efforts to replace or improve on Kyoto. Policy recommendations and negotiating strategies that ignore those collective action problems are likely to prove ineffective."
"December 12, 2007","This exploratory article seeks to identify angles for theory-guided research on European responses to terrorism. It argues that, when placed within the historical context of its own trajectory in the area of border politics, and especially experiences related to the Schengen Agreement, its implementation and cross-pillar collaboration, it is possible to identify a distinct European capability. This article describes this capability as diversity awareness. That is, as an actor on the world stage, the European Union is able to draw on transnational and trans-border experiences with law enforcement in beyond-the-state settings, as opposed to e.g. conventional warfare in order to defend the national interest. While sympathetic to the normative power Europe literature, the article's critical constructivist approach notes reservations against the Universalist bias of that literature and proposes an approach that is more conducive to empirical research instead."
"December 12, 2007","The governance of the European Union has been changed through its responses to international terrorism. The analysis of those changes is grounded in an examination of the different perceptions of the phenomenon in academic and political debate. This introductory article traces the most relevant changes across competences, policies and governing modes and highlights dynamics applicable to other areas of EU activity: cross-pillarization, the growth of horizontal governing networks, co-operation outside the treaty framework and the impact of third countries on EU policy-making. The article puts forward a three-pronged constructivist framework to understand better the main dynamics and factors underpinning the various forms of change, in particular why the emphasis has been on co-ordination and information-sharing rather than on supranational integration. Performance issues are then critically assessed, both in terms of whether the new measures, competences, instruments and resources are likely to be effective as well as with regard to the intended and unintended harmful effects for the civil and democratic rights of EU and third-country citizens."
"December 12, 2007","Within European law enforcement circles, counter-terrorism networks and privileged partnerships tend to be preferred to formal bureaucratic structures because of their flexibility and directness. The professional preference for informal, bilateral and privileged relationships may, however, undermine the potential of formally established agencies such as Europol and Eurojust, which work through national and centrally co-ordinated channels of information and intelligence. This article seeks to assess whether standards of democratic, legal and social legitimacy are under pressure as a consequence of this persistent preference for horizontal, direct and informal co-operation."
"December 12, 2007","The article argues that the relative absence of foreign policy from the EU's counter-terrorism efforts is surprising given the nature of the threat. The reasons for this range from the EU's role and approach to counter-terrorism, to the leading role of interior ministers and a focus on the internal threat. External factors and actors also come into play, such as the US global war on terror and Nato's role in counter-terrorism. The article explores three core aspects of the external dimension of counter-terrorism policy and argues that areas such as development assistance and democracy promotion have become securitized."
"December 12, 2007","While the US has revamped its intelligence community by creating the Department of Homeland Security, little seems to have happened at the European level. The article seeks to explain why some intelligence co-operation takes place within the EU and why the bulk does not. It uses a new model, the intelligence cube, to develop a discussion on co-operation in distinct areas. Following a functionalist approach, suggesting that collaboration is utility driven, it proposes that efficiency considerations offer the most convincing explanation why no new European Intelligence Agency has been created and why so little co-operation takes place within EU structures."
"December 12, 2007","Since 2001, the nature of the European Union's external action in the Mediterranean, particularly with respect to North Africa, has undergone significant change. The normative objectives of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership have become securitized in that co-operation to achieve economic and political development between South Mediterranean states has been effectively replaced by co-operation to combat a shared threat: transnational terrorism. The signifier of this process has been the way in which the approach to the issue of migration as a security concern has been modified but the consequence has been to downplay the role of norms of democratization and human rights in intra-Mediterranean political relationships."
"December 12, 2007","The appearance of the EU as a security actor has nowhere been more apparent than in the field of counter-terrorism measures after 11 September 2001. This article looks at the challenges which the EU is facing regarding its new role, taking as an example one of the corner stones of the counter-terrorism measures: the freezing of funds to persons and entities suspected of having links with terrorism. The relationship between the rights of individuals and the legal force necessitated at the EU level by heightened risk has recently been the subject of judicial and political scrutiny."
"December 11, 2007","A number of recent studies assumes that international threats issued by democratic states are more credible because their leaders face domestic punishment for failing to carry them out. Yet this argument is ultimately premised on an invariant willingness of the domestic audience to punish an incumbent for reneging on a threat. I relax this assumption and instead allow for the audience's preferences to vary according to its evaluation of the salience of the interests at stake. This theoretical modification generates several novel predictions that are strongly supported in the empirical tests. The analysis shows that democratic leaders engage in bluffs and even back down if their bluff is called. It also specifies the conditions under which democratic threats are considered credible or not, as well as the critical interplay between domestic costs and strategic interests that may lead to war."
"December 11, 2007","The events of 9/11 set in motion a massive reordering of U.S. policy. We propose that the American public's response to this redirection in policy derives, in part, from ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism - prejudice, broadly conceived - refers to the commonplace human tendency to partition the social world into virtuous in-groups and nefarious out-groups. Support for the war on terrorism, undertaken against a strange and shadowy enemy, should hold special appeal for Americans with an ethnocentric turn of mind. To see if this is so, we analyze the panel component of the 2000-2002 National Election Study. We find that ethnocentrism powerfully underwrites support for the war on terrorism, across a variety of tests and specifications, and the strength of the relationship between ethnocentrism and opinion is influenced in part by the extraordinary events of 9/11. Ethnocentrism is easily found among Americans, but its relevance and potency for politics depends, we suggest, upon circumstance."
"December 11, 2007","These two books focus not on terrorism as such, but on its psychological impact on society. Stuart Croft traces the formation of American public opinion on terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11. He argues that public opinion might have followed a different course, but stresses that attitudes to terrorism were formed not just by government or the media, but were linked to other forces such as fundamentalist religion and were even reflected in works of fiction. John Mueller asks which is the greater threat: terrorism or our reaction to it? He cites numerous cases in the past where Americans overreacted to perceived dangers' and points out that terrorism causes far fewer deaths than, for example, road accidents. He ends by suggesting that the best way to disarm terrorists is to persuade Americans to stop worrying about them while conceding that this advice is unlikely to be followed. Critics of this book may object that it implicitly underrates the terrorist threat. But this in no way invalidates the message of both these books namely that a genuine, or genuinely perceived, threat can sometimes lead to a disastrous response. Therefore, reports of alleged threats require more careful scrutiny by both politicians and the media."
"December 11, 2007","Is the moment auspicious, as William Walker has argued, for a rebirth of the world nuclear ordering project? An auspicious moment would be marked by three key factors. First, the United States would seek to assert significant leadership and moreover would be able to do so on a sustained, bipartisan basis. Second, other actors essential to the project would be ready to lend their thinking and power to this effort. Third, a few key ideas about the management of the emerging challenges of deterrence and abstinence would have emerged and garnered substantial international support. All three factors are lacking today. But the time will come. To accelerate the arrival of the necessary vision and will, the policy and analytical communities should set some priorities and focus on a few hard problems."
"December 11, 2007","We argue that certain provisions of alliance treaties can signal credible commitments to a peaceful relationship among members and establish institutional mechanisms that promote the settlement of disagreements through peaceful negotiation. Nonaggression, peaceful dispute settlement, military institutionalization, and permanent organization provisions should increase the duration of peace between alliance members; we test our hypotheses with a duration model. The analysis generally supports our expectations except that alliances that create permanent organizations, even those specifically established to arbitrate disagreements, are associated with shorter durations of peace. We conclude with some implications of our argument for the study of military alliances and international institutions more broadly."
"December 11, 2007","William Walker's article, Nuclear enlightenment and counter-enlightenment, raises fundamental questions about the history of efforts to construct order in international politics in relation to nuclear arms and weapons-related capabilities. However, Walker's enlightenment and counter-enlightenment tropes are clumsy and unsatisfactory tools for analyzing contemporary policies concerning nuclear deterrence, non-proliferation and disarmament. Walker holds that in the 1960s and 1970s most of the governments of the world came together in pursuit of a grand enlightenment project. This thesis cannot withstand empirical scrutiny with regard to its three main themes supposed US-Soviet consensus on doctrines of stabilizing nuclear deterrence through mutual vulnerability, a notion that the NPT derived from concerted efforts to construct an international nuclear order meriting that title, and the view that the NPT embodied a commitment to achieve nuclear disarmament. Walker's criticisms of US nuclear policies since the late 1990s are in several cases overstated or ill-founded. Walker also exaggerates the potential influence of the United States over the policies of other countries. It is partly for this reason that the challenges at hand both analytical and practical are more complicated and difficult than his article implies. His work nonetheless has the great merit of raising fundamental questions about international political order."
"December 11, 2007","After the 7 July and 21 July 2005 attacks on London the government-sponsored effort to 'prevent extremism together' has repeatedly acknowledged the central role of anger at UK foreign policy in the radicalization of some British Muslims. This acknowledgement has been incorporated into a 'comprehensive framework for action' centring upon the need for increased 'integration' and an effort, critically, to re-work British multiculturalism as a means to combat terrorism. Examining the history of multiculturalism in Britain and the tradition of living and acting 'together' that it suggests, however, raises a set of questions about the society into which integration is supposed to occur, what integration might involve and its real efficacy for combating terrorists. In addressing these issues, this article suggests that the debate over contemporary multiculturalism should be situated within a much wider social and political crisis over the meaning of 'community' in the UK, to which questions of global order and foreign policy are central. Comparing the 'ethical' basis of Al-Qaeda's attacks with Tony Blair's invocation of 'values' as the foundation for military intervention reveals that both seek to realize models of community through violence and a shared process of 'radicalization' which in both cases precedes 9/11 and which might be traced back to the Gulf War of 1991. The article concludes that debate over the future of multiculturalism in the UK is being conducted alongside and is implicated within a second, violent global conflict over community: one which is central to, but essentially unarticulated within the domestic context."
"December 11, 2007","The article is organized into two main parts. First, it presents the termination of the conflict in Sierra Leone as a case-study to examine the degree to which cosmopolitan values connecting peacekeeping and peace building are (or are not) evident. The case-study looks at the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) as a model of successful peacekeeping in the sense that everyday security was provided for the people of Sierra Leone through the deployment of a robust peacekeeping mission. This assessment needs to be qualified in relation to serious deficits still to be addressed in post-conflict peace building, yet the success of this mission does provide encouragement for those who see the construction of a cosmopolitan security architecture for Africa as both desirable and achievable. Second, it explores the degree to which an appropriate model of cosmopolitan peacekeeping might emerge at regional and continental levels in Africa through the development of the African Standby Force (ASF). What the case-study presented here and the survey of the African Union (AU)/ASF in the second part of the article have in common is that taken together, they provide some evidence to suggest that, however fragile, the AU is beginning to define an agenda that represents a continent wide and, in that sense at least, a cosmopolitan response to African security issues."
"December 11, 2007","When official representatives of more than 170 countries adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect (RP) at the September 2005 World Summit, Darfur was quickly identified as the test case for this new doctrine. The general verdict is that the international community has failed the test due to lack of political will. This article argues that the failure is real but that it is more fundamentally located within the doctrine of RP itself. Fulfilling the aspiration of RP demands an international protection capability that does not exist now and cannot be realistically expected. The critical weakness in RP is that the responsibility to react has been framed as coercive protection, which attempts to be a middle way between classic peacekeeping and outright military intervention that can be undertaken without the consent of the host government. Thus far, theoretical and practical attempts to create this intermediate space for coercive protection have failed to resolve basic strategic and operational issues. In addition, the very act of raising the prospect of external military intervention for human protection purposes changes and distorts the political process and can in fact make a resolution more difficult. Following an introductory section that provides background to the war in Darfur and international engagement, this article examines the debates over the RP that swirled around the Darfur crisis and operational concepts developed for the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and its hybrid successor, the UN African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), especially during the Abuja peace negotiations. Three operational concepts are examined: ceasefire, disarmament and civilian protection. Unfortunately, the international policy priority o bringing UN troops to Darfur had an adverse impact on the Darfur peace talks without grappling with the central question of what international forces would do to resolve the crisis. Advocacy for the RP set an unrealistic ideal which became the enemy of achievable goals."
"December 11, 2007","Applying the method of enlightenment correctly to the area of nuclear non-proliferation would require a major effort to critically evaluate ideologies. Liberal arms control despite its many successes and merits has devised over the years a whole set of ideological tenets and attitudes. Some of them have been transformed into beliefs that could be termed myths. The most prominent ideological myth of the liberal arms control school is the notion that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty of 1968 (NPT) was in essence a disarmament agreement, not a non-proliferation treaty. To depict the negotiations as a premeditated effort of enlightenment, where the governments of this world came together to solemnly decide that some of them would be allowed to have some nuclear weapons for an interim period while the others would renounce their possession immediately, is pure. It would be equally wrong to qualify the grand bargain as one between the nuclear haves and the nuclear have-nots. Another myth of the liberal arms control school is the notion that - in order to gain support for the NPT - the superpowers had altered their nuclear weapons strategy in the 1960s. Again, this contention is not borne out by the development of nuclear strategies and doctrines. The third myth is the contention that there was an abrupt shift in US non-proliferation policy as George W. Bush came into power. The major changes in US non-proliferation policy had already started during the Clinton administration and some of them can be traced back to the tenure of President George W. H. Bush senior. They all reflected the changed international environment and represented necessary adjustments of the non-proliferation strategy. The Clinton administration left some of the traditional paths of arms control and rightly undertook some changes that were necessary because traditional instruments of arms control were no longer adequate. The Bush administration continued that policy, but in a more radical way."
"December 11, 2007","The debate on nuclear proliferation has become increasingly polarized. While there is widespread agreement on the perilous state of the traditional non-proliferation regime, the analyzes of the causes differ widely. The liberal arms control community has sought to salvage the eroding non-proliferation regime both by overplaying its importance (nuclear enlightenments') as well as by blaming the policies of the nuclear weapons states, notably the United States. However, this view rests on several assumptions that have been increasingly revealed as myths: the myth of a universal non-proliferation norm generated largely by the Non-proliferation Treaty' the myth of a direct relationship between nuclear reductions and proliferation' and the myth of US policy being a cause of, rather than a reaction to, the non-proliferation crisis. Clinging to these myths is counterproductive, as it seeks to perpetuate old policies at the expense of new approaches. However, new approaches to non-proliferation are bound to gain in importance, even if they run counter to established arms control dogmas."
"December 11, 2007","Only since the end of the Cold War, and particularly since September 2001, have questions of anticipatory action arisen in alliance deliberations concerning the use of force. In initiating their Balkan operations, it should be recalled, the allies did not face direct threats, but intervened toterminate conflicts and human rights abuses and to shape their security environment. It has been difficult for the alliance to get to grips with the new security challenges presented by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction because of its history, its intrinsic character, and the nature of the new security challenges. Its history includes a strictly reactive posture during the Cold War and its interventions from a position of overwhelming superiority in the Balkan conflicts. The new security challenges place under stress the alliance's intrinsic character as a permanent coalition of sovereign independent states committed to collective defence because these challenges may endanger specific allies to differing degrees (in contrast with the overarching Soviet threat during the Cold War) and revealdiff erences in interests, capabilities and strategic cultures among the allies. The allies have not yet resolved questions concerning the legality and legitimacy of the antici patory use of force, nor have they fully explored the implications of concepts such as 'constructive abstention' and 'NATO in support' with regard to preemptive or preventive operations undertaken by a group of allies."
"December 11, 2007","Given the apocalyptic nature of nuclear weapons, how can states establish an international order that ensures survival while allowing the weapons to be used in controlled ways to discourage great wars, and while allowing nuclear technology to diffuse for civil purposes? How can the possession of nuclear weapons by a few states be reconciled with their renunciation by the majority of states? Which political strategies can best deliver an international nuclear order that is effective, legitimate and durable? These have been central questions in the nuclear age. This article suggests that the effort to construct such an order displayed the characteristics of an enlightenment project, with its emphasis on balance and rationality, the quest for justice and trust among states, the feasibility of instrumental regulation, and the attachment to hope and progress. With the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at its heart, it necessarily gave precedence to diplomacy and containment over preventive war. The reasons why this conception of nuclear order was discarded by its erstwhile champion, the United States, in favor of one bearing traits of counter-enlightenment, are explored. Its alternative strategy can now be declared a failure. Avoidance of a greater disorder depends on recognition that the problem of nuclear order is more than the problem of proliferation, or of non-compliance, and on recovery whatever the difficulties of the cooperative yet pragmatic sensibility that lay behind the prior approach to order."
"December 11, 2007","The Steps-to-War theory of international conflict argues that territorial issues are more salient than other issues domestically. However, the evidence for this conclusion almost always rests with international conflict outcomes, assuming away the domestic political processes leading to greater salience. In the tolerance literature, several studies note that political attitudes, particularly toward unpopular groups, vary systematically across different states but provide few explanations that account for these differences. We believe these two observations are linked and argue that territorial threats serve as one factor conditioning individual political attitudes that privilege national unity over freedom of expression. Using World Values Survey data collected from 33 countries, and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) techniques, our paper confirms this. We find evidence that the type of external threat facing a country matters in moderating individual attitudes, even after controlling for economic and institutional differences across the states sampled. Specifically, we demonstrate how the diffusion from territorial threats to domestic audiences results in a chilling effect on individual willingness to extend democratic freedoms. Thus, we show that territorial issues exhibit greater salience domestically than other types of international issues."
"December 11, 2007","The ceasefire agreement signed in 2002 between the LTTE/Tamil Tigers and the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) now lies in complete disarray. The civil war has restarted; at least 3,500 lives have been lost in 2006 as a result and 'disappearances' are also increasing. This is a particularly difficult time for the civilian population trapped between the two sides. It is not clear whether or not either side has taken clear-cut strategic decisions or know what they hope to achieve during this unfortunate chapter in the civil war. Does the LTTE regard this phase as a prelude to somethingbigger, seeking to demoralize and weaken the GoSL security forces prior to a major offensive? Or is this a frustrated reaction to a failed peace process and a major split in the LTTE ranks? What aims are the GoSL seeking to achieve by paying so little attention to the impact of their assaultson innocent civilians in the north and east? Moreover, where does the international community turnnext? If there is to be a signi. cant victory by either side, the major obstacle and challenge in the future will be legitimacy on the one hand and governance on the other."
"December 11, 2007","In the context of rising regional instability and conflict, along with increased incidents of global terrorism, in a dynamic, uncertain security environment, emerging nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction threats both state proliferation and terrorism are seen as growing dangers giving rise to increasing global insecurity. The international nuclear nonproliferation regime, the centerpiece of which is the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), is essential to current and future non-proliferation efforts and needs to be maintained and strengthened, not replaced. The normative and legal weight of the regime is important for counter terrorism as well as non-proliferation, but it will not likely directly affect the behavior of so-called rogue states and terrorists. Preventing them from achieving their objectives if they attempt to wield nuclear and radiological weapons may deter and dissuade them, as may a credible prospect of punishment. The interaction of non-proliferation and deterrence, so clear during the Cold War history of the NPT, remain crucial parts of an increasingly complex picture."
"December 11, 2007","This article attempts to clarify some of the central questions and distinctions that provide the necessary backdrop for thinking in a sophisticated way about security in Africa. Drawing on the developing Critical Security Studies literature it suggests that an understanding of security based on people, justice and change offers the surest route to a stable future. It then sketches preliminary answers to some fundamental questions, namely: whose security should be prioritized? How have security dynamics in Africa been influenced by the wider processes driving world politics? What clusters of threats are the most salient? Where do such threats have the most pernicious effects? Which actors are best placed to alleviate those threats? And what sort of institutions should be built to assist in that process? The role of outsiders concerned with promoting security on the continent should be to try to ensure that as many Africans as possible are able to voice their opinions on these crucial issues."
"December 11, 2007","Because most of the world's proliferators have used the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty's (NPT) call on nations to share the benefits of the applications of peaceful nuclear energy to help justify their nuclear activities, it is unclear just how much any proliferator ultimately has been restrained by these rules. This needs to change but is unlikely, unless the NPT's qualifications on the right to peaceful nuclear energy are read in a much more restrictive fashion to only authorize nuclear projects that are clearly beneficial economically and that truly can be safeguarded against diversion to make bombs. In this regard, our best hope is that, as nations consider how to prevent global warming, they might adopt clear economic guidelines that would compel all energy projects both nuclear and non-nuclear to compete economically against one another on a much more level playing field. This would make dangerous, uneconomical nuclear projects far less likely to be pursued, and a centering of the world's security on a proper reading of the NPT much more likely and sustainable. Indeed, unless economic discipline of this sort is attempted internationally, it is quite likely that the continued implementation of the current egregious view of the NPT will only serve to accelerate nuclear proliferation more rapidly than if there was no NPT at all."
"December 11, 2007","William Walker's article takes a strongly universalist view of the requirements of nuclear order. It finds recent American administrations deliberately unwilling to maintain international confidence in the necessary collective narrative of eventual universal nuclear disarmament, so causing a crisis of confidence in the Non Proliferation Treaty regime. This commentary examines how far realistically different recent US policies and declarations could have avoided such problems, given certain underlying realities and dynamics surrounding the management of nuclear weapons. It also questions how indispensable abstract universalism will be in containing future nuclear proliferation."
"December 11, 2007","Since 2006 there has been a significant reduction in the level of fighting in the Russian republic of Chechnya between federal troops and Chechen rebels, indicating a substantial weakening of the insurgency. However, violence in the region has not entirely subsided' indeed, it has been spreading to neighboring regions in the North Caucasus. Today, a loose network of formally autonomous violent groups, or Islamic jamaats, has developed throughout the North Caucasus, primarily in the Muslim republics of Ingushetia, Dagestan, Karachaevo-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria. Islamic ideals seem to guide and inspire much of the terrorist violence, although they are intermingled with deep nationalist sentiments, especially among rebel groups in Chechnya. However, the intricacies of the violence in the North Caucasus are much more complex, and are only partially related to the spread of radical Islam and separatist aspirations. Other underlying factors, such as the perpetuation of discredited and corrupt ruling elites, the persistence of severe economic hardship, youth unemployment and social alienation, and the absence of proper and effective channels of political expression are also driving the violence. Although hardly ever reported by the western media, events in the North Caucasus have significant implications for Europe and the wider world. The enlargement of the European Union and the inclusion of Ukraine and the three South Caucasian states into the EU neighborhood policy have brought these countries and the adjacent areas of the North Caucasus closer to the EU. As a result, events in the North Caucasus are no longer the sole remit of countries in the region. There is a risk that instability and violence in the North Caucasus may spread into areas that are of growing significance not only to Europe, but also to the United States and the Atlantic alliance."
"December 11, 2007","This article demonstrates how concepts and notions such as warlordism and terrorism, supposedly framed to enable an understanding of complex crises, can have exactly the opposite effect. It exposes their conceptual ambiguity, a factor contributing to their success, and comments on their practical application in the Somali context. The article seeks to analyze how these two categories have contributed to building a specific regime of truth vocabulary, assumptions of meaning, labels and narratives that function to select and interpret events, emphasizing some and disregarding many others. The article presents the argument that the recurrent mobilization of these particular expressions has resulted not in deepening analysis, but rather in sifting information and providing moral condemnation and political prescription that are highly debatable."
"December 11, 2007","This study explores logical and empirical implications of friendship and enmity in world politics by linking indirect international relations (e.g., ""the enemy of my enemy,"" ""the enemy of my friend"") to direct relations (""my friend,"" ""my enemy""). The realist paradigm suggests that states ally against common enemies and thus states sharing common enemies should not fight each other. Nor are states expected to ally with enemies of their allies or with allies of their enemies. Employing social network methodology to measure direct and indirect relations, we find that international interactions over the last 186 years exhibit significant relational imbalances: states that share the same enemies and allies are disproportionately likely to be both allies and enemies at the same time. Our explanation of the causes and consequences of relational imbalances for international conflict/cooperation combines ideas from the realist and the liberal paradigms. ""Realist"" factors such as the presence of strategic rivalry, opportunism and exploitative tendencies, capability parity, and contiguity increase the likelihood of relational imbalances. On the other hand, factors consistent with the liberal paradigm (e.g., joint democracy, economic interdependence, shared IGO membership) tend to reduce relational imbalances. Finally, we find that the likelihood of conflict increases with the presence of relational imbalances. We explore the theoretical and practical implications of these issues."
"December 11, 2007","William Walker is right to link the international nuclear order to the international political order, and to assert that the attempt to construct a rational nuclear international order around the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty is in a shambles. But he puts too much of the blame on the Bush administration (which he is right to criticize) and tends to neglect the flawed character of the project itself (and the recent changes in the political international order which have an inevitable bearing on the nuclear one)."
"December 05, 2007","This article asserts that a challenge exists in deflecting the prevailing view that a general gap of legal applicability exists in respect of legal regulation of the war on terror. This ""gap"" is articulated by a focus on a new phenomena¿namely the emergence of Al Qaeda as a nonnationally motivated, transnational terrorist organization whose actions and actors do not ""fit"" existing legal norms and sanctions. In addressing that challenge, this article will rebut the argument that suggests a legal lacuna exists, and that no appropriate legal tools are available to states and international organizations as they confront the post September 11th context. In particular, the argument asserts that existing legal norms provide sufficient coverage to respond to the conflicts experienced in the contemporary moment, as well as to the state and non-state entities participating in them. The article suggests that clarity about the boundaries between the legal regime of international human rights law and international humanitarian law would assist closing off perceived regulatory gaps. It contends that the usual rationale given in favor of parallel application, namely higher protection for the victims of conflict, substantially underestimates its other valuable policy and instrumental benefits. Specifically, the traditionally vaunted victim centered rationale does not sufficiently weigh the value of affirming consistent rule of law coverage to situations of conflict. The article asserts that while further regulatory measures may be possible and even desirable to confront the contemporary challenges of conflict forms (including terrorism), a combined or dynamic approach to the law of war and international human rights law provides sufficient traction and norm content to address and be relevant to present needs."
"November 28, 2007","Three models are presented in which two players agree to share power in a particular ratio, but either player may subsequently ""fire"" at the other, as in a duel, to try to eliminate it.  The players have positive probabilities of eliminating each other by firing.  If neither is successful, the agreement stays in place; if one is successful, that player obtains all the power; if each eliminates the other, both players get nothing.  In Model I, the game is played once, and in Model II it is repeated, with discounting of future payoffs.  Although there are conditions under which each player would prefer not to shoot, satisfying these conditions for one player precludes satisfying them for the other, so at least one player will always have an incentive to shoot.  In anticipation, its rival would prefer to shoot, too, so there will be a race to preempt.  In Model III, a damage factor caused by shooting, whether successful or not, is introduced into Model II.  This mitigates the incentive to shoot but does not eliminate it entirely.  The application of the models to conflicts, especially civil wars, is discussed."
"November 17, 2007","The aim of this paper is to examine the validity of the deterrence theory that bolsters the stability of MAD. This paper deals with the question on why some countries go to unfair and extreme war even though they are rational and well-informed about opponent's intentions. By combining the well-known prospect theory with statistical decision theoretical methods including mean-variance analysis, we argue the threshold of war initiation heavily depends on the evaluation of status quo. Our deductive results show the main arguments of power transition theory is still valid in the context of the nuclear era while nuclear proliferations based on balance of power can result in highly unstable world by increasing the possibility of ""intentional"" nuclear attacks by dissatisfied countries."
"November 16, 2007","The presentation of different nationalities and religious movements in the press varies given the source of the publication and the background of the reporter.  Walter Lippman (1914) produced the first comprehensive discussion of this problem nearly 100 years ago during another period of international crisis.  Edward Said (1981) addressed the current form of the problem in the general context of Islam and the Western press. In this essay, I briefly focus the analysis on the Western press and Turkey, with regard to the relation of religion and secularism comparing both to Turkey and nations in the West. The means of defining or measuring the degree of influence of religion is diffuse and by using some current standards the USA would be considered a fundamentalist nation. An examination of the Armenian Question is also included.  I also examine these problems and the related idea of the conflict of cultures that so profoundly undermines the means of securing a constructive international dialogue on the crisis of our times."
"November 14, 2007","Understanding suicide bombing entails studying the phenomenon on three different dimensions: the suicide bomber, the terrorist organization, and the community from which suicide bombings emerge. Political and social psychology allow us to establish the reciprocal relationships that underpin the exchanges between the three dimensions. This method increases our theoretical understanding of suicide bombing by moving away from the unidimensional models that have previously dominated the terrorism literature."
"November 14, 2007","Decentralising reforms in the period 1999-2001 were associated in some places with communal (religious and ethnic) warfare. The connection can be better understood with the techniques of resource mobilisation than with those looking for grievances. The former takes more interest in history and politics than in timeless hurts. A study of the conflict narratives shows that these episodes emerged as 'politics by other means' at a moment of opportunity following the collapse of the New Order in 1998. They were led by urban middle class elements in provincial towns outside Java that were particularly dependent on state subsidies. The history of these mainly administrative towns is entwined with that of state formation throughout the twentieth century. In the short term, a practical solution to these problems has been found in learning to make better local rules. In the longer term, they lie in building a substantive democracy in Indonesia, even at the risk of messy communitarian expressions of popular sovereignty."
"November 14, 2007","Power sharing is modeled as a duel over some prize.  Each of two players may either share the prize in some ratio or fire at the other player - either in sequence or simultaneously - and eliminate it with a specified probability.  If one player eliminates the other without being eliminated itself, it captures the entire prize, but the prize is damaged over time when there is shooting.  Simultaneous shooting, which is more damaging than sequential shooting, tends to induce the players to share the prize and expand their opportunities for sharing it.  It was effectively implemented by the superpowers with the doctrine of launch on warning during the Cold War, and it was strengthened by the development of second-strike capability.  Deterring terrorism has proved a different matter, because terrorists are difficult to detect and present few targets that can be damaged."
"November 12, 2007","This paper presents a model of conflict in an economy characterized by two sectors. In a first sector labelled as contested sector two agents struggle in order to appropriate the maximum possible fraction of a contestable output. In a second sector, the uncontested sector, each agent holds secure property rights over the production of some goods. Both agents maximize an income function which can be defined as a function of contributions of both sectors. Results show that the degree of returns in the uncontested sector is a powerful force which countervails the impact of destructive and unproductive interaction in the contested sector."
"November 12, 2007","This study aims to test the relationship between democratization, competitiveness of political participation and the likelihood of war. Many of studies focus on the direct effect of democratization on the likelihood of initiation a war. However, proponents of this argument posit that democratization leads to the emergence of different groups which compete with each other in political arena, and this competition results in dangerous wars. In this study, I test both effects of democratization and the number of political groups on the likelihood of initiation a war. Results suggest that democratization does not have any effect on war. However, the number of competing groups does matter and negatively affects the likelihood of war. The more competing groups in a state, the less likely that this state initiates a war. This result is contrary to the argument made before which was not empirically analyzed."
"November 11, 2007","We survey several of the theoretical models that have been applied to the analysis of the GATT/WTO dispute settlement process.  These include repeated game models, which emphasize the punishment aspect of dispute settlement, and incomplete contracting models, which emphasize the 'gap-filling' aspect.  Our analysis emphasizes the implications of these models for the strengthening of the dispute settlement process under the WTO and for its application to the TRIPS agreement.  We also discuss how models of settlement bargaining can be applied to obtain empirical predictions about which cases will actually proceed to an actual finding by the dispute panel."

"November 09, 2007","Japan's strategic thinking has been driven by three main factors: a fear of isolation, calculation of the geopolitical strength of China (and to a lesser extent, Korea), and accommodation to the prevailing international power structure. During the Cold War Japan aligned with Washington, but maintained sufficient distance to explore a mutually beneficial relationship with China based on Japan's dominant economic position. As Chinese power has grown and Japan's own economic tools for statecraft have slowed, Tokyo has moved closer to the United States to balance Chinese power. Japan has also had to seek new ways to shape the security environment in Asia, turning to multilateral diplomacy such as the Changmai Initiative. Where Japan's diplomacy in Asia in the 1980s and 1990s emphasized Japan's unique ability to champion ""Asian"" values with the West, increasingly Tokyo has emphasized its unique ability to champion universal values of democracy and rule of law in Asia. This theme has been used by conservative governments to improve Japan's brand over China, but also builds on a tradition of Japanese diplomatic efforts to take a lead in rule-making in the region. Prime Minister Koizumi's assertive foreign policy helped to reinvigorate Japan's international position, but he moved from the traditional three part formulation of Japan's orientation - the U.S. alliance, the UN system and Asia - to a simpler two part formulation of ""the U.S.-Japan alliance and international cooperation."" The lack of focus on Asia has contributed to growing tensions with South Korea and China over history issues, even as Japan's global and broader regional standing has increased according to most opinion polls. These regional challenges will continue to confront future Prime Ministers well past Koizumi."
"November 09, 2007","This Article examines the strengths and weaknesses of modern pacifist religious philosophy. The Article suggests that some intellectual arguments for pacifism are logically solid (once certain premises are granted), while others have serious flaws. The article discusses five influential philosophical advocates of non-violence Thomas Merton, Stanley Hauerwas, Leo Tolstoy, Tony Campolo, and John Howard Yoder. In addition, the Article examines three real-world cases where the practice of non-violence was put into action: the Danish rescue of the Jews during WW II, the American Civil Rights movement in the South in the 1960s, and the invasion of the Chatham Islands - the home of the pacifist Moriori tribes."
"November 01, 2007","The EU is approaching bordering countries offering them ""neighbourhood relations"", but it fails short of taking into consideration how this concept may be perceived by its partners. This paper will propose a reconsideration of the term ""neighbour"" in the conviction that this operation is of fundamental importance in order to solve any eventual misunderstanding on its meaning and to define, in the context of the ENP, what the nature of a relationship of neighbourhood may imply. In particular, it will look at the literature to show that this term, far from being uncontested, fundamentally implies an ""othering"" practice which transcends the Christian teaching to ""love one's neighbour as oneself"". Then, it will underline that this word may have different connotations in partner countries which may go beyond a neutral indication of geographical proximity and which may not correspond to the meaning consolidated in the Anglo Saxon tradition which basically refers to a neighbour as to a ""fellow"". Finally, the paper will underline that the same fundamental ambiguity which marks the term here considered lies at the very core of the ENP. As a matter of fact, this policy shows persisting uncertainties on how to substantiate the relationship with neighbouring countries, whether in terms of fellowship and integration or in terms."
"October 30, 2007","Can environmental law actually achieve environmental conservation or implement an environmental ethic in practice?  The environmental movement has been captured by a legal centralist perspective, which asserts that legal institutions and processes are integral to achieving environmental conservation and environmentally ethical behavior."
"October 23, 2007","This paper explores the strategic problems that arise when a state seeks to use military force to compel changes in another state's policies.  Although the costs associated with military action mean that there generally exist compromises that both sides prefer to conflict, bargaining may fail if such deals are not enforceable in the face of temptations to renege on policy concessions.  I develop a model which shows that inefficient conflict can occur when states bargain over policies that one of them can change unilaterally and covertly.  I then show that this theory is useful for understanding a common, but under-appreciated, source of international conflict: conflicts that arise when one state supports rebel groups engaged in a civil war with another state.  Indeed, episodes of rebel support are associated with a substantial increase in the risk of militarized conflict, comparable to the risk associated with territorial disputes.  I show that agreements to limit rebel support are most likely to reduce interstate violence if they are coupled with concessions by the target state and/or monitoring mechanisms, both of which are shown theoretically to mitigate the enforcement problem."
"October 21, 2007","Who do NGOs represent, and to whom should they be accountable?  In this brief essay, I argue that most NGOs represent only themselves, if the term is defined according to its ordinary meaning in democratic politics.  But that fact should not prevent NGOs from involvement in international security issues or world politics more broadly.  They play important roles both as service providers and as advocates.  Given this view, NGO accountability is less of a problem than often believed, and attempts to increase accountability should be implemented cautiously, particularly for advocacy NGOs."
"October 19, 2007","The events of Abu Ghraib exposed politicians, journalists, military and law enforcement personnel, NGOs, activists and ordinary citizens to the potential brutality of state repression. Many were left stunned that the agents of a liberal democracy would perpetrate such horrific acts against individuals in the state's control. Such shock makes sense if one believes that liberal democratic institutions constrain leaders from acting on the utilitarian incentive to employ torture during interrogations. While such a belief is apparently widespread, is it consistent with the recent historical record? Extant theories of repression and global evidence about torture suggest that it is not. We distinguish among three mechanisms that might constrain the use of torture in liberal democracies: voice, veto, and freedom of expression. We then argue that voice is unlikely to have a strong effect when the state is faced with violent dissent, and that the effect of veto and freedom of expression will be substantially reduced when the state is faced with a violent challenge. To test our hypotheses we use data from 146 countries covering the years 1980-1999 and investigate the extent to which voice, veto, or freedom of expression inhibit countries' use of torture both in times of quiescence and in times when dissidents challenge the state with violence. We find that rather than being aberrant, state-sponsored torture like that in Abu Ghraib is perfectly consistent with both theory and previous experience. More specifically, democratic institutions reduce the probability that a state uses torture in only limited circumstances."
"October 17, 2007","In 1997 Rwanda introduced a re-settlement policy for refugees displaced during previous conflicts. We exploit geographic variation in the speed of implementation of this policy to investigate the impact of conflict-induced displacement and the re-settlement policy on household agricultural output and on skill spill-over mechanisms between returnees and stayers. We find that returns to on-farm labour are higher for returnees relative to stayers, although the evidence suggests that the policy contributed little additional effect to this differential. More speculatively, these differentials suggest that, upon return from conflict-induced exile, returnees are more motivated to increase their economic performance."
"October 17, 2007","Closely examining the Darfur, Sudan, genocide, and making reference to other genocides, this Article argues that the genocide prevention strategies which are currently favored by the United Nations are ineffective. This Article details the failures of targeted sanctions, United Nations peacekeepers, and other antigenocide programs. Then, this Article analyzes the Genocide Convention and other sources of international human rights law. Because the very strong language of the Genocide Convention forbids any form of complicity in genocide, and because the Genocide Convention is jus cogens (meaning that it prevails over any conflicting national or international law), this Article  concludes that the Genocide Convention forbids any interference, including interference based on otherwise valid laws, against the procurement of defensive arms by groups which are being victimized by genocide."
"October 17, 2007","The UK's Treasury's ""Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change"" (Oct. 2006) reached dramatically different conclusions and policy recommendations than most earlier economic analyses of climate change. It found that the costs of climate change, as well as the potential net benefits of greenhouse gas reductions, were much higher that previously estimated, and consequently recommended more rapid and extensive cuts in emissions than other economist analysts. The Stern Review estimated that a 1% annual investment of global GDP in mitigation could prevent a 5% (or more) reduction in annual global GDP from climate change harm, forever. A number of prominent economists, including William Nordhaus, Partha Dasgupta, Richard S.J. Tol, Robert Mendelsohn, and Martin Weitzman, have criticized the Stern Review on various grounds, including its damage estimates and the selection of parameter values (the utility discount rate and the elasticity of marginal utility), which affect the interest rate at which future costs and benefits are discounted to present value. This paper summarizes the Stern Review and its critiques, and assesses them from a process-oriented perspective to determine what they can teach us, positively and negatively, about how benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) should (or should not) be done."
"October 17, 2007","At the beginning of the second millennium, there was no separation of church and state, and kings ruled the church. Tyrannicide was considered sinful. By the end of the thirteenth century, however, everything had changed. The Little Renaissance that began in the eleventh century led to a revolution in political and moral philosophy, so that using force to overthrow a tyrannical government became a positive moral duty. The intellectual revolution was an essential step in the evolution of Western political philosophy that eventually led to the American Revolution."
"October 17, 2007","This article examines the religious background of the American Revolution. The article details how the particular religious beliefs of the American colonists developed so that the American people eventually came to believe that overthrowing King George and Parliament was a sacred obligation. The religious attitudes which impelled the Americans to armed revolution are an essential component of the American ideology of the right to keep and bear arms."
"October 14, 2007","This paper explores when and why private communication works in crisis diplomacy.  Conventional audience-cost models suggest that state leaders must go public to reveal information in interstate crises because leaders cannot enhance their credibility by tying their hands if domestic audiences cannot observe their private signals.  I present a crisis bargaining game where both the sender and the receiver of signals have a domestic audience.  The equilibrium analysis demonstrates that a private threat, albeit of limited credibility, can be equally compelling as a fully credible public threat.  Secrecy works in crisis diplomacy despite its informational inefficacy because secrecy insulates leaders from domestic political consequences when they capitulate to a challenge to avoid risking unwarranted war.  The logic of efficient secrecy may shed light on the unaccounted history of private diplomacy in international crises.  The Alaska Boundary Dispute illustrates this logic."
"October 14, 2007","This study contrasts the rationalist and psychologist approaches to information failure as the cause of crisis escalation and war.  Building on the psychological insights on misperceptions, I study a simple game-theoretic model of crisis bargaining, where signals are subject to perceptional errors and thereby multiple interpretations.  The model allows us to analyze the interplay between the strategic problem of misrepresentation in sending signals and the problem of misperceptions in forming beliefs.  The analysis offers a rationalist logic of signaling and perception, which links Bayesian learning, incentive problems, misperpcetion, and war.  The analysis also shows that misperpcetion generates more than pathologies in crises-misperception, under the right condition, makes signals fully informative, reduces the risk of war, and attenuates the adverse impact of incomplete information on the risk of crisis escalation and war."
"October 04, 2007","After gaining overwhelming support in a March 2007 national referendum, long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak introduced new constitutional amendments that effectively give more power to the president and loosen controls on security forces. Mubarak's amendments constitute the latest move in a set of orchestrated plans not only to entrench the stronghold of his own National Democratic Party and pave the way for his son as his successor but also to curb the power and ambition of his greatest opposition - the Muslim Brotherhood. As he steps into his fifth consecutive six-year term in office, Mubarak and his regime are being met with harsh criticism as opposition groups, human rights advocates, and Western governments urge for meaningful democratic reform in the country. But promoting democracy is a complex issue in Egypt, and indeed in much of the Arab world. Mubarak and other leaders face the Islamist Dilemma, where any move toward a more democracy-friendly political system threatens to empower Islamic militants and open the floodgates for non-secular political parties."
"September 29, 2007","We test whether endogenous exchange rates have an impact on behavior in a linear public good experiment. Paying participants based on endogenous exchange rates (which basically means paying shares of a known quantity to participants according to how well they do relative to others) can simplify an experimenter's budgeting decisions but creates tournament incentives - participants do not need to do as well as possible, but just better than other participants."
"September 21, 2007","This paper develops a dynamic theory of war and peace. In our framework, an aggressive country can forcibly extract concessions from a non-aggressive country via war. Alternatively, it can avoid war and allow the non-aggressive country to make concessions on its own. Both countries suffer from limited commitment, and under peace, the non-aggressive country may receive a private shock which deems concessions too costly. We show that the realization of war sustains concessions along the equilibrium path. In the efficient sequential equilibrium, the aggressive country punishes failed concessions by requesting larger and larger concessions, and their failure eventually leads to a war which can be temporary. After a temporary war, the aggressive country forgives the non-aggressive country by re-engaging in peace because of the coarseness of public information. In the long run, temporary wars can be sustained only if countries are patient, if the cost of war is large, and if the cost of concessions is low. Otherwise, the aggressive country cannot continue to forgive the non-aggressive country, and countries converge to total war (permanent war)."
"September 21, 2007","This paper highlights the question of Muslim integration in Europe from the recent perspective of the social integration of non-nationals in the EU, put forward by the European Commission (2007). While there is a never-ending debate on Islamism, Islamist terrorism and the identity of Europe vis-à-vis growing Muslim communities in Europe, there are hardly any solid cross-national data being presented on the real extent of the Islamist threat facing Europe, and on the social conditions that lead to Islamist radicalism. Our rigorous quantitative results, based on the first systematic use of the Muslim community data contained in the European Social Survey (ESS), all support a socio-liberal view of migration and integration, and contradict the very extended current alarmist political discourse in Western Europe."
"September 20, 2007","The termination of war is mostly seen as a basis not just for recovery but for a fundamental transformation or change in development paths towards peace, stability and development. The Central American peace processes of the last decades were one of the first laboratories for the liberal peace-building paradigm which assumes that the threefold transformation to peace, democracy and market economy is a self-strengthening process leading to sustainable development. Although none of the three countries slipped back into war, serious deficits remain. This paper introduces an analytical framework that aims at interrelating the threefold transformation with the impact generated by four processes. These include the repercussions generated by the international system on a country's society, its historical, cultural and social foundations, the legacies of violence and the peacebuilding initiatives the country concerned has witnessed. The comparative analysis of changes in the public security sector, the political system, conflict resolution and the use of resources show why there is so much path dependency that can explain the deficits of transformation."
"September 19, 2007","The use of bribes to co-opt an enemy's forces can be a more effective way to wage war than the conventional use of force: Relative to bombs, bribes can save lives and resources, and preserve civic institutions. This essay evaluates the efficacy and normative desirability of selectively substituting bribes for bombs as a means of warfare. We show how inter-country disparities in wealth, differences in military strength, the organization of the bribing and recipient forces, uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, and communications technology can contribute to the efficacy of bribes. We discuss methods for enforcing bargains struck between opposing forces, a key problem in structuring bribes. We also examine the legal status of bribe agreements, under both international and U.S. law. While the former apparently views bribery as legitimate means of warfare, the latter poses a potentially significant obstacle by refusing on public policy grounds to enforce secret contracts made with foreign agents."
"September 14, 2007","This paper attempts to bridge the gap between revolution studies and democracy studies, and investigates the roles of party politics in individual revolutionary decision. In this study, the revolution to democracy is formulated as an asymmetric global game, and the coordination problem between a single democratic organization (party) and a continuum of ordinary citizens (masses) under incomplete information concerning the strength of autocracy is highlighted. Within appropriate fundamental parameters regarding the relative magnitude of revolutionary cost/return, as well as the size of this organization, the threshold strategies tuple consist the unique rationalizable equilibrium. The existence of a democratic organization, regardless of its action, is shown to increase the incentives for some citizens to join revolution, thus facilitate revolution. Moreover, as the incentives and the political resources in the hand of party change, the various forms of the revolution, ranging from masses revolution to one-side action, emerge. Finally, the policy implication is discussed, the connection with the real world example (students movement) gets special focus, and the efficient ways for democratisation promotion are proposed."
"September 14, 2007","This article engages in a thorough assessment of the Bush Administration's  main security strategy documents related to combating terrorism, namely the 2002 and 2006 National Security Strategy documents, the 2003 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, and the 2006 National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism. First, the article assesses the value and importance of strategy documents and the utility in analyzing them. Second, the strategies are analyzed based on the process by which they were authored, the structural elements of the strategy, and the strategy's content. Third, the article discusses the overall content of counter-terrorism strategy and makes some recommendations for change. The article concludes with suggestions as to how the NSS can be improved from a legal and structural standpoint. Congress should either begin to enforce the provisions of 50 U.S.C. § 404a, or amend it to reflect  realistic expectations for national security strategizing."
"September 12, 2007","This study investigates whether there is an association between a trajectory of political liberalization, democratization, and military interventions. In what is arguably the 'least likely-case' region in the world, this study analyzes the experience of 55 regimes in Africa between 1990 and 2004 and finds a striking regularity. Liberalizing, and in particular democratic, regimes have a significantly different track record of being subjected either successful or failed military interventions. The analysis suggests that democratic regimes are about 7.5 times less likely to be subjected to attempted military interventions than electoral authoritarian regimes and almost 18 times less likely to be victims of actual regime breakdown as a result. Through an additional case study analysis of the 'anomalous' cases of interventions in democratic polities, our results are largely strengthened as most of the stories behind the numbers suggests that it is only when democratic regimes perform dismally and/or do not pay soldiers their salaries that they are at great risk of being overthrown. Legitimacy accrued by political liberalization seems to 'inoculate' states against military intervention in the political realm."
"September 12, 2007","While the idea is controversial, it is quite possible that, at least under certain circumstances, the fighting effectiveness of a conscript army can equal that of a professional army. For any army, fighting effectiveness is not only influenced by the degree of psychological cohesion among soldiers and officers, but also by the organizational culture of each particular service unit towards the preparation for war and the waging of the conflict itself. The Malvinas (Falklands) War of 1982 demonstrates this very well."
"September 11, 2007","When do states stop receiving aid? Drawing on research on the end of cooperation, this paper hypothesizes that changes in a recipient's economy, regime type, and human rights record, as well as economic and security changes in the donor-recipient relationship are likely to explain the termination of aid. This is tested on all US aid recipients from 1951-2000. Results indicate that the economic need and growth rate of a recipient state as well as the presence of a militarized dispute strongly influence how long a state receives aid. Some support was found for the human rights behavior of recipient states."
"September 04, 2007","The world can be complex and dangerous - the loss of state stability of countries is of increasing concern. Although every case is unique, there are important common processes. We have developed a system dynamics model of state stability based on an extensive review of the literature and debriefings of subject matter experts. We represent the nature and dynamics of the 'loads' generated by insurgency activities, on the one hand, and the core features of state resilience and its 'capacity' to withstand these 'loads', on the other. The challenge is to determine when threats to stability override the resilience of the state and, more important, to anticipate conditions under which small additional changes in anti-regime activity can generate major disruptions. With these insights, we can identify appropriate and actionable mitigation factors to decrease the likelihood of radical shifts in behavior and enhance prospects for stability."
"August 31, 2007","Why are some countries more technologically innovative than others? National technological capability plays an important causal role in theories of war, alliance formation, and patterns of international trade and finance. However, explanations for national differences in technological capabilities have had little place in theories of international politics. This gap is the result of assumptions made by most IR theorists that the rate and direction of technological change are either random, scientifically determined, or structured solely by domestic institutions. This paper will bring together recent findings about the political economy of technological innovation in order to show that much of this conventional wisdom about technology is incorrect. Instead it will be theorized that, due to the distributive nature of technological change, each nation's balance of internal versus external threats to security determines its technological trajectory. That is, ceteris paribus, states concerned more with domestic security (the maintenance of civil order between domestic interest groups) should innovate relatively less; states concerned more with external security threats (to strategic economic inputs or military capability) should innovate relatively more. Put more simply, this paper will show how international relations are as important as domestic institutions, if not more so, in determining national innovation rates."
"August 26, 2007","This paper confronts and answers the difficult definitional questions raised by the threat of Al Qaeda and other transnational terrorist organizations. Are terrorists analogous to other kinds of organized, dangerous criminals who should be prosecuted and punished using the federal criminal law? Or are they equivalent to enemy soldiers engaged in warfare against the United States? There are problems with either analogy because the threat posed by Al Qaeda and other transnational terrorist organizations has substantial differences from both paradigmatic criminal activity and paradigmatic military conflict. Thus, it is far from clear whether alleged terrorists should be treated as criminal defendants or military enemies."
"August 24, 2007","For more than a decade, military thinkers have debated the impact of ""information operations"" (IO) on armed conflict.  Responding to the possibilities (and vulnerabilities) inherent in the interconnectivity of the Internet and other information networks, IO constitutes a new form of warfare.  IO uses methods such as computer network attacks or psychological operations to influence, disrupt, corrupt, usurp and defend information systems and the infrastructure they support.  As militaries work through what IO can do, however, they must also wrestle with when and how they can employ it - i.e., the question of law's application to IO.  Since computer networks and modern information systems constitute new tools (and new targets) for military activities, international law currently regulates them only by analogy, and even then, in a patchwork fashion.  Most states and scholars appear content with this situation, denying any need to develop IO-specific rules.  This short essay challenges that conventional wisdom.  Even as it applies to IO, the existing legal framework suffers from several, near-fatal conditions:  uncertainty (i.e., militaries lack a clear picture of how to translate existing rules into the IO environment); complexity (i.e., overlapping legal regimes threaten to overwhelm military commanders seeking to apply IO); and insufficiency (i.e., existing rules fail to address basic challenges of modern conflicts with non-state actors).  This situation creates disincentives for militaries to use IO, notwithstanding IO's potential to achieve military and political objectives with less harm than conventional bombs or missiles.  To redress these deficiencies, I propose states adopt an international law for information operations, or ""ILIO.""  By adopting an ILIO, states could alleviate the uncertainty and complexity of the status quo, reduce transaction costs for states fighting global terror, and lessen the collateral costs of armed conflict itself."
"August 20, 2007","When states are attempting to recover from periods of serious human rights abuse, they often must try to reconcile the competing demands of different stakeholders. These demands may range from claims that complete impunity is a necessary sacrifice to achieve peace, to the belief that without justice no meaningful peace can be reached. This paper will attempt to highlight the ways in which international courts and quasi-judicial bodies address the dilemma of peace versus justice, in relation to amnesty laws. The discussion will consider the main international standards on impunity, the international jurisprudence relating to amnesties and whether international courts should recognize amnesties that are accompanied by alternative forms of justice. This paper will argue that international courts should recognize amnesties that are introduced with democratic approval to promote peace and reconciliation, provided that they are accompanied by mechanisms to fulfil the victims' rights."
"August 20, 2007","This paper attempts to examine agreements between two high conflict states - India and Pakistan - in comparison with those between parties characterized by high degrees of conflict along ethnic and religious lines, from a theoretical perspective with a view to determining if legalization has any correlation between the commitments embodied in agreements between such states and the degree of compliance. For purposes of comparison, I examine the historic agreement between Israel and Egypt, and the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) as exemplars of similar conflicts where legalization has salience. I adopt the lens of legalization articulated by Abbott, et al, and bring recent advances from the intersection of international relations theory and international law to the design and structuring of agreements between states beset by persistent hostilities. I analyse agreements between India and Pakistan, Israel and Egypt, and the Darfur Peace Agreement, to demonstrate that agreements that are high on the precision-obligation-delegation matrix enjoy higher degrees of success than those that are low on this matrix when concluded between high conflict states. I conclude by arguing that India and Pakistan should aim for hard legalization to solve the Kashmir dispute, and that they must learn from the painful experience of the Darfur Peace Agreement and include non-state actors as signatories to any agreement."
"August 17, 2007","The period since the end of the Cold War has presided over a dramatic expansion in the number of multilateral peacekeeping operations (PKOs). Yet individual states have varied significantly in their enthusiasm for peacekeeping and, moreover, demonstrated a greater propensity to participate in operations located in certain countries than others. Our contribution in the present paper is to provide new insights into how geography underpins these spatial variations. Uniquely, we make use of a geographically disaggregated dataset of multilateral PKOs, which allows us to capture various dyadic linkages between sending and receiving countries. Our results confirm previous work indicating that more democratic countries are more likely to participate in PKOs, but extend these findings by showing that countries' commitment to human rights has a similar positive influence. We also show that aspects of spatial proximity (physical distance, same region) and relational proximity (colonial ties) between potential sending and receiving states raise the likelihood of participation. Yet we find that two relational variables widely discussed in the literature as possible correlates of peaceful interactions - bilateral trade and joint membership of intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) - have no statistically discernable influence on countries involvement in particular PKOs."
"August 16, 2007","In an autocracy, the ruling elite allocates resources to unproductive contest in order to protect its power. This paper establishes that a flatter income distribution, a slow-growing or shrinking capital stock, and a decrease in the relative size of the workforce increases the likelihood of a decision by the ruling elite to negotiate a transition to democracy. In a model of economic cooperation and political conflict, the losses from ceding control over the tax rate may be lower than the costs of defending minority privilege. The predictions are evaluated in the light of the South African and other recent transitions."
"August 16, 2007","This paper presents a two-player proactive response game: the targeted government first chooses its measures to weaken the terrorists, and the terrorists then choose the type of event - normal or spectacular - whose outcome is dependent on proactive responses and nature. Unlike previous analyses, proactive policy has a downside by increasing grievances and, consequently, terrorist recruitment. If the government responds too harshly, its actions can empower the terrorists by providing a larger constituency. Aggressive antiterrorist actions, encouraged by a"
"August 13, 2007","Most research on congressional consideration of foreign and defense policy concludes that ideology is the most important influence on roll call voting and that constituent economic interests are not very important.  This paper challenges this conclusion on two grounds.  First, most previous research conceives of constituent economic interests on these issues very narrowly, examining only the benefits constituents obtain from providing military goods and services rather than their economic stakes in the broader goals of national security policy.  Second, constituent economic interests can influence the ideology of their representative, something most research does not consider.  An examination of key votes on military resource allocation, intervention, and foreign aid from 1947 through 2000 supports these objections."
"August 13, 2007","This research note evaluates the effect of economic interests on public support for American global activism.  Those who were relatively well-positioned to benefit from the American-supported postwar international order should be more likely to support it.  An analysis of American National Election Study data on support for isolationism between 1956 and 2000 supports this line of argument.  Individual self-interest is probably the most important pathway through which the international economy has influenced public opinion.  However, the aggregate effects of exports and imports on respondents' home states have also made a difference.  The effects of economic interests are substantively large and fairly consistent over time."
"August 13, 2007","This paper evaluates the effect of economic interests and security concerns on American intervention in international conflict.  Generalizations about the relative importance of these considerations have played an important role in the historiography of American foreign relations.  Although statistical analysis is well suited for evaluating such generalizations, quantitative researchers have devoted relatively little attention to the issue.  Existing large-n research has generally found that security concerns matter more, but has not considered how the economic and security concerns thought to affect intervention might also influence each other.  These subsidiary relationships complicate efforts to assess the relative importance of these two influences on intervention.  Evidence concerning intervention in international crises and civil wars indicates that, while alliance commitments and rival behavior have a greater immediate impact on American intervention, exports have an important indirect effect by shaping alliance commitments in the long run."
"August 13, 2007","The domestic politics of American military spending during the Cold War confronts scholars with an important but often overlooked puzzle: the two major parties appear to have switched positions on the issue.  During the early Cold War era, Democrats were generally supportive of increased military spending while Republicans were critical.  After the mid-1960s, Democrats increasingly tended to oppose larger military budgets, while Republicans more often favored them.  This paper presents evidence about the process through which this change took place.  It identifies several developments in the domestic and international environment that may have contributed to this party switch, and evaluates preliminary evidence about each of them."
"August 13, 2007","Alliances are usually understood as a way for states to aggregate military capabilities in the face of a common threat.  From this perspective, the willingness of relatively powerful states to form alliances with much weaker partners is puzzling.  The weaker ally often adds little to the stronger state's security and may increase its chance of military entanglement.  This paper presents evidence that international trade helps explain these alliances.  Just as fear of losing a valuable trading relationship deters bilateral conflict between trading partners, so it also gives states that have the power to do so a motive to defend their trading partners from external threats that might disrupt commerce.  This argument contrasts with most other research on trade and alliances, which reverses the causal arrow and suggests instead that alliances increase trade.  Empirical analysis employing several different datasets on bilateral trade indicates that trade makes the formation of alliances more likely in major power-minor power dyads, and reduces the probability that these alliances will dissolve.  By contrast, there is no evidence that alliances increase trade between these pairs of states."
"August 13, 2007","Research in international relations commonly finds that major powers behave differently than do other states.  Indeed, the assumption that major powers are potentially active anywhere on the globe is the basis for treating dyads that include them as politically relevant in many studies.  In spite of their importance, relatively little attention has been paid to what makes a major power.  The possession of substantial material power is obviously an important part of the story, but becoming a major power also entails a policy choice.  This paper considers three explanations for this choice, two drawn from the realist tradition, and one from the liberal tradition.  Implications of these three explanations are tested against two policies characteristic of major powers: the development of military power and the construction of power projection capability.  The results tend to support the liberal argument that economic stakes in the world beyond their borders drives these policy choices, but there is some evidence for the offensive realist claim that potential power also plays an important role in these choices."
"August 06, 2007","Drawing upon the theory of hegemonic stability, this paper advances a theory of international economic structures. It places particular emphasis on analyzing the whole structure of the international economy, and not simply the absence or presence of hegemony. It finds that there is no axiomatic relationship between hegemony and free trade or declining hegemony and protection. By differentiating between non-hegemonic structures, moreover, the theory of international economic structures also calls into question the appropriateness of the 'British' or '1930' analogy for the future of the present international economy. Finally, the theory is briefly examined through the case of American trade policy in the inter-war period and the 1970s and 1980s. The conclusion argues against simplistic analogies between the two periods and maintains that a considerable potential does exist for collective leadership of the international economy in the 1980s."

"August 02, 2007","The current model of state-building implicitly rests on a formal-legal conception of legitimacy in which law or institutions confer authority on officials, who then employ that authority to create a social order. But a formal-legal approach, however well suited to established states governed by a rule of law, is inappropriate in the anarchy of a failed state. Key to successful state-building, I argue, is restoring the legitimacy of the state's monopoly of violence. I develop an alternative, relational conception of legitimacy drawn from social contract theories of the state in which authority derives from a mutually-beneficial contract in which the ruler provides a social order of benefit to the ruled, and the ruled in turn comply with the extractions (e.g., taxes) and constraints on their behavior (e.g., law) that are necessary to the production of that order. The contract becomes self-enforcing - or legitimate - when individuals and groups become ""vested"" in that social order by undertaking investments specific to the particular contract. This implies that providing security, protecting property rights, and adjudicating disputes within society should be the first step in any state-building process. International trustees can facilitate indigenous state-building efforts by helping establish a social order and creating expectations that the order will endure into the future. By creating expectations of stability, the trustee can encourage specific investments and the vesting of interests in the social order. This paper proceeds in five principal sections. The first examines the concepts of state failure and state-building, arguing for a new focus on rebuilding state legitimacy. Section II probes and criticizes the intellectual foundations of the current model and practice of state-building. I then develop an alternative analytic foundation and model that rests of a relational conception of authority in Section III. I develop the role of international trustees in the state-building process and examine further the tensions identified above in Section IV. The final section examines the case of Somalia."
"August 02, 2007","The state is central to the study of international relations and will remain so into the foreseeable future. State policy is the most common object of analysis. States decide to go to war. Correspondingly, states are a common unit of analysis in theories of international relations. This essay first reviews the rationales behind state-centric theories of international relations. The second section examines criticisms and probes the limits of state-centric theories. The third part identifies within state-centric theory three areas of promising research."
"July 29, 2007","This article examines homeland security preparedness and planning with the aim of generating some future research themes related to organizational, collaborative, and adaptive management elements of homeland security. It analyzes survey data from city managers in the US and their views on the current state of homeland security. The key results indicate that there is a high level of collaboration between and among city government and other levels of government in homeland security preparedness and planning, supporting an element of the adaptive management theory. However, with regard to using performance systems to gain accountability in homeland security this was not commonly occurring. The federal government's color-coded homeland security advisory system is viewed by 32% of city managers who responded to the survey as being ineffective. The largest administrative/management homeland security concerns were lack of money and personnel limitations."
"July 27, 2007","The dominant hypothesis in the literature that studies conflict is that poverty is the main cause of civil wars. We instead analyze the effect of institutions on civil war, controlling for income per capita. In our set up, institutions are endogenous and colonial origins affect civil wars through their legacy on institutions. Our results indicate that institutions, proxied by the protection of property rights, rule of law and the efficiency of the legal system, are a fundamental cause of civil war. In particular, an improvement in institutions from the median value in the sample to the 75th percentile is associated with a 38 percentage points' reduction in the incidence of civil wars. Moreover, once institutions are included as explaining civil wars, income does not have any effect on civil war, either directly or indirectly."
"July 25, 2007","Economists have recently turned their attention to the effects of terrorism. One much debated effect of terrorist attacks is its impact on the results of democratic elections. We use the electoral consequences of the terrorist attacks of the 11-M in Madrid to analyze this issue. We consider this particular experiment since the attack took place only three days before the 2004 Congressional Election, which allows the use of credible identification criteria. In particular, we use the advance voting by Spanish residents abroad, who cast their vote before the terrorist attack, to identify the effect of the bombing. We exploit this macabre natural experiment to run a difference-in-differences estimation using data on three consecutive Congressional elections. Our empirical results indicate that a terrorist attack can have a large impact on the outcome of democratic elections."
"July 23, 2007","This report suggests and justifies a simple approach to arms competitions, wherein arms competitions are viewed as disaggregated competition between pairs of weapons systems for executing mutually incompatible policy goals.  This approach is derived from a decision theoretic model of armament choice, in which military decision makers make trade-offs between alternative strategies of weapons deployment to achieve national foreign policy objectives.  Data representing a cross section of the U.S. and USSR military arsenals are employed in a quasi first-difference two-stage least squared analysis to provide evidence for the propositions of the model and this approach."
"July 19, 2007","This article argues the centrality of the Dred Scott case in the election of Abraham Lincoln and to the national crisis of 1860.  Taking the view that the struggle over the expansion of slavery into the territories was in essence a scramble for national political power, the economic,  political, legal and social roots of the sectional dispute are traced, and the causal connections between Dred Scott and the coming of the Civil War, among other causes, are clarified."
"July 03, 2007","Two collective action problems plague successful revolution. On the one hand, would-be revolutionaries confront a ""participation problem"" whereby no rationally self-interested individual has an incentive to participate in rebellion. On the other hand, individuals face a ""first-mover problem"" whereby no rationally self-interested individual has an incentive to lead rebellion. This paper argues that 18th-century merchant sailors devised an institutional solution to these problems to facilitate maritime revolution and overthrow abusive captains. This institution was called a ""Round Robin."" Round Robins solved both the ""participation problem"" and the ""first-mover problem"" by aligning the interests of individual sailors desiring mutiny and restructuring the payoffs of leading vs. following maritime rebellion."
"June 30, 2007","This article's analysis of the Oslo Accords and their failures reveals important lessons about what in a bilateral peace agreement's text can maximize, and what can diminish, the likelihood that the parties will comply with the agreement's terms.  Reviewing and building upon three key books, the article makes clear that the Oslo process and texts failed to take advantage of many of the most valuable contributions that international law can make to successful peace negotiations.  The failure to take advantage of these tools meant the Accords were, from the beginning, weaker than they could have been.  That congenital weakness was compounded by the parties' heavy reliance on two methodological pillars - open-ended gradualism and constructive ambiguity - that proved to be disastrously counterproductive."
"June 01, 2007","This article, part of an ongoing project by the author on law and hegemony in Eurasia, considers the strengths and weaknesses of the New Haven School's policy-oriented jurisprudence in light of the competition among multiple conceptions of world public order that exist today. Taking as its starting point the concept of the world being divided into diverse systems of public order, as defined by Harold Lasswell and Myres McDougal, this article assesses how this idea of diversity applies to post-Cold War geopolitics. As a test case, it focuses on Eurasia as a geographic space where multiple conceptions of public order, including those of the United States, the European Union, Russia, and Islamic fundamentalism, overlap, interact, and at times compete, especially in the unstable arc of states bordering Russia."
"May 23, 2007","Americans are a major target of international terrorism. Yet, terrorists from some countries are much more likely to attack American citizens than terrorists from other countries. Similarly, anti-American terrorism from a specific foreign country is much more prevalent during certain periods than others. This article develops a rational theory of international terror¿ism, which argues that attacking foreign nationals is of strategic value to terrorists even if they ultimately aim at gaining political influence in their home country. Attacking foreigners is the more attractive to do¿mestic terrorists the more the terrorists' home government depends on military support from the foreign country. Applied to the US case, our theory predicts that more anti-American terrorism emanates from countries, which receive more US mili¿tary aid and arms transfers and in which more American military personnel are stationed, all relative to the country's own military capacity. Estimations from a directed country dyad sample over the period 1978 to 2005 support the predictions of our the¿ory for both terrorist incidents involving Americans and terrorist killings of Americans as dependent variables. These results are robust to a wide range of changes to the empirical research design."

"May 04, 2007","In the post-9/11 era, a new focus on failing states and their ability to threaten global security has influenced US foreign policy and aid policy. This paper explores the links between failing states and transnational threats such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, organized crime, and global pandemics. It argues that analysts and policymakers must look more deeply at precisely how failing states pose a threat to global security. By offering a thorough survey of this issue, the author provides a framework for determining which states are associated with which dangers. He puts forth a roadmap for US policy that includes deeper intelligence collection and analysis, improved policy coherence, and more robust international engagement to tackle the threats posed by weak states in the new millennium. This paper is a part of CGD's ongoing work on security and development."
"April 18, 2007","Earlier studies have shown that United Nations peace operations make a positive contribution to peacebuilding efforts after civil wars. But do these effects carry over to the period after the peacekeepers leave? And how do the effects of UN peace operations interact with other determinants of peacebuilding in the long run? The author addresses these questions using a revised version of the Doyle and Sambanis dataset and applying different estimation methods to estimate the short-term and long-term effects of UN peace missions. He finds that UN missions have robust, positive effects on peacebuilding in the short term. UN missions can help parties implement peace agreements but the UN cannot fight wars, and UN operations contribute more to the quality of the peace where peace is based on participation, than to the longevity of the peace, where peace is simply the absence of war. The effects of UN missions are also felt in the long run, but they dissipate over time. What is missing in UN peacebuilding is a strategy to foster the self-sustaining economic growth that could connect increased participation with sustainable peace."
"April 12, 2007","Using an ""event-study"" methodology, this paper analyzes the aftermath of civil war in a cross-section of countries. It focuses on those experiences where the end of conflict marks the beginning of a relatively lasting peace. The paper considers 41 countries involved in internal wars in the period 1960-2003. In order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the aftermath of war, the paper considers a host of social areas represented by basic indicators of economic performance, health and education, political development, demographic trends, and conflict and security issues. For each of these indicators, the paper first compares the post- and pre-war situations and then examines their dynamic trends during the post-conflict period. It conducts this analysis both in absolute and relative terms, the latter in relation to control groups of otherwise similar countries. The paper concludes that, even though war has devastating effects and its aftermath can be immensely difficult, when the end of war marks the beginning of lasting peace, recovery and improvement are indeed achieved."
"April 09, 2007","Despite a significant expansion of the literature on conflicts and fragility of states, only a few systematic attempts have been made to link the theoretical literature on social conflicts to the available micro-level information about the people who are involved in these conflicts. We address this lacuna in the literature using a household-level data set from Kosovo. Our analysis suggests that it is individually rational for competing ethnic communities, Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs, to resist a quick agreement on a social contract to share the region's resources."
"April 03, 2007","The power of words is the power of persuasion. The exportation of the foundational legal principles that helped form the American republic can serve as instrumental ""soft power"" tools in the war on terror. Efforts promoting projects like the Arabic Book Program are important vehicles to cross-cultural and cross-lingual international relations. This Article argues that an arsenal of words can be as, or more, powerful than an arsenal of artillery. The West has much to offer, but the rest of the world needs to be able to read it without getting lost in translation.  Providing linguistic access to the documents that have spurred American progress economically and in governance can be a valuable tool for international peace and progress. For that effort, translations are key."

Countering some alarmist voices in the West, neither migration nor Muslim culture are to be blamed for the contemporary crisis, but the very nature of unequal capitalist accumulation and dependency that is at the core of the world capitalist system. For one, our analysis is based on current thinking on Kondratiev waves of world political development inherent in recent work by IIASA and the NATO Institute for Advanced Studies."
"March 27, 2007","In this study, I look at the consequences of variations in authoritarian elite coalitions for international conflict behavior, using Fearon's audience cost theory to frame my argument.  In dictatorships, the elite coalition is the group that has the power to oust the dictator.  Because of this, the coalition plays the role of the domestic audience.  Just as voters can make democratic leaders pay for failing to follow through with their commitments, so can the elite coalition in authoritarian regimes.  In personalist regimes the elite coalition is the personalist clique, in military regimes it is the military junta, and in single party regimes it is the party cadre."

"January 19, 2007","This paper explores the experience between 1939 and 1945 of two neutral states which on the face of it had in common only one notable achievement: the fact that they each managed to stay out of Britain's war despite sharing land borders with her or her possessions, and despite considerable diplomatic and economic pressure from more than one of the major belligerents - in Ireland's case Britain and the United States, in Afghanistan's Britain and (after June 1941) the Soviet Union."
"January 07, 2007","This essay asks what gives the executive the right - that is, either a genuine legal justification or, at the least, an accepted basis of extralegal legitimacy - to detain presumed terrorists for the purposes of interrogation. In search of an answer it lays bare the fact and consequences of an executive policy aimed in large part at extracting information against a person's will with little regard for harm that the policy might work upon the person or, for that matter, upon the state.  The essay first establishes that to invade the essence of the individual in service of an asserted interest of state departs radically from the humanist principles that underlie modern law. The essay then demonstrates that the overt invasion of the human, as individual and as collectivity, also deviates from realist theories that underlie modern politics. By way of example, the essay looks to an early source of such theories, Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince. In so doing, the essay exposes the inability of the U.S. executive to find in either humanist or realist theories of statecraft any cloak of legitimacy for its interrogation paradigm."
"December 24, 2006","The conventional wisdom in political science is that for a democracy to be consolidated, all groups must have a chance to attain power. If they do not then they will subvert democracy and choose to fight for power. In this paper we show that this wisdom is seriously incomplete because it considers absolute, not relative payoffs. Although the probability of winning an election increases with the size of a group, so does the probability of winning a fight. Thus in a situation where all groups have a high chance of winning an election, they may also have a high chance of winning a fight. Indeed, in a natural model, we show that democracy may never be consolidated in such a situation. Rather, democracy may only be stable when one group is dominant. We provide a test of a key aspect of our model using data from ""La Violencia"", a political conflict in Colombia during the years 1946-1950 between the Liberal and Conservative parties. Consistent with our results, and contrary to the conventional wisdom, we show that fighting between the parties was more intense in municipalities where the support of the parties was more evenly balanced."

"December 15, 2006","This article posits a theoretical framework within which to analyze various aspects of post-September 11 detention policy - including the widespread prisoner abuse that has been documented in the leaks and official releases that began with publication of photos made at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. Examined are the actions of civilian executive officials charged with setting policy, of judicial officers who evaluated it, and military personnel who implemented it.  Abuse has been attributed to failures of training or planning.  The article concentrates on a different failure, the failure of law to keep lawlessness in check.  On September 11, law's map was replete with national and international norms and doctrines, enforcement regimes, and compliance mechanisms concerning detention and interrogation.  For more than two years thereafter the United States nonetheless maintained spaces within which, it said, executive fiat controlled.  Initial judicial hesitancy to intervene was due in part to legal tradition:  on account of the prevailing construct of relevant legal disciplines such as conflicts of law and public international law, actors did not see - did not even see a need to see - the myriad laws that ought to have cabined their behavior.  The Supreme Court's 2004 detention trilogy signaled a willingness to interpose judicial supervision over policy and practice when appropriate.  But that message came too late for persons assigned to hold and interrogate persons labeled ""the enemy,"" under conditions that made abuse possible, even, perhaps, inevitable."
"December 15, 2006","This article addresses not only offshore detainees at Guantánamo and elsewhere, but also the two Americans and one Qatari held in the United States as enemy combatants.  It focuses on the critical issues in U.S. litigation - extraterritoriality and deference - yet also examines the scope of detention and the propriety of proposed special tribunals.  After demonstrating that in the wake of September 11, 2001, no U.S. constitutional precedent governed these issues, the article then looks to norms drawn from international humanitarian and human rights law to aid decision.  The Supreme Court increasingly consults such external norms as persuasive authority; most recently, it found support in a European human rights judgment for its conclusion in Lawrence v. Texas that the Constitution forbids criminal punishment of homosexual conduct.  This article likewise considers the constitutionality of governmental policy in light of external norms.  It thus concludes: first, that U.S. courts have jurisdiction to scrutinize extraterritorial detention; second, that the doctrine of executive deference must yield to judicial duty to protect individual rights; and finally, that alleged conditions of detention and interrogation, as well as the proposal for trial before special tribunals, may violate core guarantees of the U.S. Constitution."
"December 08, 2006","The Ottoman Empire's widespread persecution of Assyrian civilians during World War I constituted a form of genocide, the present-day term for an attempt to destroy a national, ethnic, or religious group, in whole or in part. Although there were no extermination camps on the scale of Auschwitz, the genocide of the Assyrians resembled the Holocaust of Jews, Slavs, Roma people, leftists, homosexuals, and other minorities under Nazi occupation during World War II because Ottoman soldiers and their Kurdish and Persian militia allies subjected hundreds of thousands of Assyrians to a deliberate and systematic campaign of massacre, torture, abduction, deportation, impoverishment, and cultural and ethnic destruction. According to the American ambassador to Constantinople from 1913 to 1916, Henry I. Morgenthau, widely regarded as a principal source of information on the Armenian genocide: ""The story which I have told about the Armenians I could also tell with certain modifications about the Greeks and the Syrians,"" as Assyrians were often known to the West. He added that the Ottoman Empire ""decided to apply the same methods [of ""wholesale massacre""] on a larger scale not only to the Greeks but to the Armenians, Syrians, Nestorians [i.e., Assyrians], and others of its subject peoples."" In 1918, according to the Los Angeles Times, Ambassador Morgenthau confirmed that the Ottoman Empire had ""massacred fully 2,000,000 men, women, and children¿Greeks, Assyrians, Armenians; fully 1,500,000 Armenians."""
"November 29, 2006","Antidumping laws have been the protectionist's tool of choice since the creation of the World Trade Organization led to the decline of tariffs and quotas and the liberalization of trade. Domestic producers have abused the antidumping laws to prevent foreign competition at the expense of the general public. It is a practical example of rent seeking. The aggressive use of the antidumping laws has led to problems in international relations as well, since target nations feel they are being treated unfairly. In some cases, they retaliate by imposing trade restrictions of their own on the countries that launched the antidumping investigations against them."

"November 08, 2006","The twentieth century witnessed some of the worst destruction of libraries and archives during armed conflicts.  Ad hoc tribunals created to try war crimes have made some progress in establishing individual criminal responsibility for crimes against cultural property.  However, crimes that involve the destruction of libraries and archives are not prosecuted as separate incidents due to the courts' failure to specifically list such crimes as separate counts of indictment.  The lack of the prosecution of the individuals responsible for crimes of library and archive destruction is one of the reasons why the assault on the documentary heritage of the world continues."
"October 30, 2006","This paper analyses two anti-terrorism policies when a targeted nation's people and property are in jeopardy at home and abroad. A country's deterrence decision involves both external benefits and costs as the terrorist threat is deflected, while its preemption decision typically gives external benefits when the threat is reduced for all potential targets. With damages limited to home interests, a country will overdeter, while, for globalized terror, a country will underdeter. Pre-emption is usually undersupplied. Leader-follower behaviour is apt to lessen inefficiency for deterrence, but worsen inefficiency for pre-emption, compared with simultaneous-choice equilibrium allocations. Targeted nations can never achieve the proper counterterrorism policy through leadership."
"October 18, 2006","We investigate whether temporary members of the UN Security Council receive favorable treatment from the IMF, using panel data for 191 countries over the period 1951 to 2004. Our results indicate a robust positive relationship between temporary UN Security Council membership and participation in IMF programs, even after accounting for economic and political factors, as well as regional and country effects, and duration dependence. There is also evidence that UNSC membership reduces the number of conditions included in IMF programs. The size of the loan, however, is not affected by UNSC membership."
"October 13, 2006","This article describes research on the challenges that suicide attacks and other mass casualty attacks have posed to policy-makers and first responders in Israel. The authors describe a model of response to attacks which focuses on defensive responses to terrorism: prevention, crisis management and reconstruction. The authors draw out the lessons for other countries and discuss the problems that still need to be addressed in order to cope effectively with current and future terrorist attacks."
"October 13, 2006","The spate of terrorist attacks in New York, London and Madrid has raised some significant issues for the public management of critical infrastructures. In many countries, privatizations in the 1980s and 1990s have transferred key elements of the critical infrastructure to private companies. Because these infrastructures are of major significance to our societies and economies, they must be protected against prolonged periods of breakdown. The new terrorism has the potential to do just that. The management of this new threat is a complex task, which invariably will be undertaken by both public and private actors. They must deal with the core challenges of the prevention of attacks, effective communication of information across organizational boundaries and the 'ownership' of crisis decision-making. This article considers these issues within the context of the broader research areas of public management and crisis management."
"October 09, 2006","There is a coordianted effort on part of academics, scholars, think-tankers, journalists and others to create a profle of Muslim militants as essentialist terrorists who commit heartless violence because they are spiritually addicted to violence. These authors argue that no concrete grievances or violations of rights cause Muslim militancy. Free to trash the core beliefs of Islam and free to make fun of Islamic creeds, the Highly influential Terrorist Literature (HITLit) has successfully equated puritan Islam with terrorism. Most HITLit authors, known as terrorism experts, are research associates with influential think tanks such as RAND and the American Enterprise Institute, and some teach at Harvard University. Some have worked for the National Security Council and the U.S. Defense Department. These authors include Bernard Lewis, Bruce Hoffman, Steven Simon, Jessica Stern, Daniel Benjamin, and Richard Perle. They appear on National Public Radio and major radio and television networks to comment on terrorist events and disseminate their views to the general public. The HITLit themes of the essentialist terrorist are further disseminated through the views of collaborating journalists such as Thomas Friedman, Charles Krauthammer, David Brooks, and William Kristol. This Article argues that the HITLit theories splash distortions that lead to lawlessness."
"October 02, 2006","This paper is another attempt to be a link between studies on political stability and growth and studies on military expenditures and growth. However, despite the other two studies in that concept, this paper takes military expenditures as a tool of a democratic government to achieve economic stability and growth. For that purpose, the paper takes political economics and defense literature arguments together and provides and empirical analyzes of the relations between political stability, economic growth and military expenditures. Based on the theoretical model developed by Blomberg (1996), the vector autoregression analyzes for Turkey, a democratic country open to all kinds of terrorism, indicates the positive impact of military expenditures on private sector investment decisions and so on economic growth."
"September 19, 2006","Based on governance-related criteria, this article provides the empirical jurimetric verification of the how, where, when and why alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms provide efficiency enhancing channels to redress grievances in less developed countries. Based on data collected in 16 developing jurisdictions through a representative sample of poor rural households, the analyses contained in this paper identifies criteria within which ADR enjoys a comparative advantage over court-based formal dispute resolution procedures. The piece further addresses comparative and competitive aspects of formal versus informal dispute resolution and provides policy recommendations in order for the state to ""assimilate"" lessons drawn from the functioning of informal mechanisms."
"September 17, 2006","When the longest-serving African dictator, Togo's Gnassingbé Eyadéma, died unexpectedly in February 2005 after 38 years of autocratic rule, Togo became a test case for indigenous democratisation efforts of African states. However, it soon became clear that a change of regime through the ballot box was impossible, in view of the consolidation of this dictatorship through decades of ill-applied foreign assistance. Political conflict flared up again. Eyadémas son, Faure Gnassingbé, sized power in a coup with the backing of the army and the Barons of the ruling party. Violent protest at home and diplomatic pressure of major donors and African peers forced Gnassingbé to hold presidential elections in April. But as the elections were rigged right from the beginning, it was no surprise that they confirmed the power of the incumbent as heir to the throne of his father. In the interest of political stability in the sub-region, neighbouring states, France and the ECOWAS condoned the election results and the brutal political persecution of opponents. About 700 people died and some 40,000 fled to neighbouring Benin and Ghana in fear of reprisals. Only if the international giver community is ready to take and learn from its errors responsibility for it, a democratic Transition can still succeed. This requires first of all a durable mandate of the EU or the United Nations, i.e. substantial security, organizational and financial intervention for the support of the democratic forces of Togo at the time of the execution of fair and free elections. Afterwards a long-term reconstruction assistance is indispensable."
"August 22, 2006","This article documents the arrest and detention of an immigrant caught up in a post-9/11 enforcement sweep by immigration enforcement authorities.  This article offers a critical discussion of the legal process to which this immigrant was subject and outlines two strategies to terminate proceedings on the basis of unlawful racial profiling and failure to charge the detained immigrant within a reasonable period of time.  Using the case as a microcosm of immigration enforcement policy in the post-9/11 era, it is argued that race-based immigration enforcement justified by the War on Terror is an extension of race-based criminal enforcement justified by the War on Drugs.  Consequently, political strategies to protect the rights of subordinated populations in the United States, both immigrant and native, against the authority of the state must be developed and supported by cross-racial alliances."
"August 16, 2006","We consider social contracts for resolving conflicts between two agents who are uncertain about each other's fighting potential. Applications include international conflict, litigation and elections. Even though only a peaceful agreement avoids a loss of resources, if this loss is small enough, then any contract must assign a positive probability of conflict. We show how the likelihood of conflict outbreak depends on the distribution of power between the agents and their information about each other."
"August 15, 2006","I analyse the emergence of property rights in a model of conflict and production in the absence of institutions of enforcement. The population of agents evolves dynamically through conflicts for possession of factor goods among pairs of randomly matched agents. Conflicts are incomplete information wars of attrition with an agent`s type consisting of his or her independently drawn valuation of the prize and cost of competing for it. I prove equilibrium existence and show that in the steady state of the game, the population sorts into two stable groups (resource ""haves"" and ""have-nots"") in accordance with a known function of their primitive types."
"August 03, 2006","This paper tracks the evolution of genocide from an accepted wartime practice in antiquity to an international crime today and the concommitant effort to hold sovereigns accountable for commission of genocide.  The trial of Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague is analyzed as the first prosecution of a head of state for genocide."
"August 03, 2006","This article analyzes the interpleay between emerging customary law norms with regard to the duty of prosecution/extradition (aut dedere aut judicare) and operation of the death penalty as a bar to extradition. As America's war on terror generates more detainees abroad, issues raised in this discussion are likely to become even more prevalent.  Given the current level of fluidity in these developing concepts, this study attempts to rationalize them into a coherent and useful analysis."
"August 03, 2006","The federal government's policy responses to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the ensuing conduct of President Bush's war on terror have thrown American civil liberty rights into disarray.  Attorney General Ashcroft and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld have trampled U.S. constitutional and international norms in their unlawful detention of hundreds of individuals and designation of enemy combatants, unlawful combatants, and material witnesses.  The federal judiciary is now responding to these executive abuses.  This article considers the early judicial responses to the policies effectuated by the Bush administration."
"August 03, 2006","The foreign policy of president George W. Bush's first term has been characterized by his black/white unilaterilist view of the world.  This has damaged America's image abroad immensely and hobbled the ability of the U.S. to achieve key foreign policy goals.  This paper examines that unfortunate phenomenon and considers the multilaterist approach advocated by Secretary of State Powell in dealing with Iraq to be a possible turning point for American foreign policy that would be missed if the U.S. unilaterally invades the country without U.N. or allied backing."
"August 03, 2006","The trial of Saddam Hussein on charges of genocide for gassing thousands of Iraqi Kurds in Halabja and elsewhere during the Anfal campaigns and against the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq will be difficult.  Prosecutors must prove before the Iraqi Special Tribunal Hussein's specific intent to commit genocide.  Saddam will be able to argue that his intent was other than genocide.  Among the arguments he may present, economic security, repelling Iranian forces and political cohesion may be the strongest.  This paper examines the strategies that both defense and prosecution attorneys will consider as Saddam's trial for genocide gets underway."
"August 03, 2006","Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. government implemented a number of inbound cargo security programs it described as ""pushing the border outward"" or ""expanding [the U.S.] perimeter of security.""  Are these statements rhetorical flourish, or do these programs materially affect international cargo trade?  This article argues that far from being mundane or rhetorical, these cargo security programs are transforming how U.S. borders operate from both a conceptual and practical perspective.  Specifically, by moving certain aspects of border functionality to locations well-removed from the physical U.S. border, these programs make U.S. regulation of inbound trade significantly more extraterritorial.  These changes affect not only U.S. national security, but also the very patterns and growth of international trade in goods."

"August 03, 2006","America's military response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks was an invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, toppling the Taliban government and pursuing al Qaeda remnants.  This action was covered by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter as self-defense and carried forth under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Charter as a NATO operation.  This paper analyzes the legality of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan."
"July 21, 2006","Power is widely acknowledged to affect negotiator performance.  Yet few efforts have been made to integrate the most prominent theories of power into a cohesive framework that can account for the results from a broad array of negotiation-relevant research.  We address this limitation by proposing a dynamic integrative model that decouples power into four components:  1) potential power, 2) perceived power, 3) power tactics, and 4) realized power.  Implications, propositions, and future directions are discussed."
"July 20, 2006","This article is divided in four parts. Firstly is described the Argentine's legal framework: icsid and BIT's estructure. Secondly, is described Argentine's situation facing the increasing number of claims iniciated under ICSID Convention. Then, the paper focus on some strategies to be taken by the government and juridical just to solve the problem with minimum risk. They are divided into political  and juridical strategies giving reasons to challenge the doctrine that affirmed the unconstitutional nature of icsid awards. Finally, the paper presents some preliminary conclusions."
"July 14, 2006","The belief in occult forces is still deeply rooted in many African societies, regardless of education, religion, and social class of the people concerned. According to many Africans its incidence is even increasing due to social stress and strain caused (among others) by the process of modernization. Most often magic and witchcraft accusations work to the disadvantage of the poor and deprived, but under particular circumstances they become a means of the poor in the struggle against oppression by establishing cults of counter-violence. Magic and witchcraft beliefs have increasingly been instrumentalized for political purposes. Apparently they lend itself to support any kind of political system, whether despotic or democratic. The belief in occult forces has serious implications for development co-operation, too. Firstly, because projects, constituting arenas of strategic groups in their struggle for power and control over project resources, are likely to add further social stress to an already endangered precarious balance of power, which makes witchcraft accusations flourish. And secondly, because witchcraft accusations may serve as indicators of hidden social conflicts, difficult to detect by other methods."
"July 14, 2006","The strange collusion between occult belief systems and different trans-national social networks, embedded in specific transformations of local and global modes of production, results in unique but reinforcing modifications of witchcraft belief, its underlying structures and its impact on the process of democratisation. The amazing range of possible results has been indicated by the analysis of two outstanding examples of witchcraft violence in South Africa in times of transition: in the former homelands of Venda and Lebowa, seemingly 'traditional' elements of witchcraft accusations, mediated by a misguided struggle for liberation, stimulated the sympathetic attention of stakeholders beyond the local setting. On the other hand, the occult base of violence in the Transkei became so blurred by involvement of 'modern' elements of globalised markets of violence that it was hardly visible any more, although undercover its repressive effects were still very much alive. These different roots of witchcraft violence had serious repercussions on conflict resolution and genuine reconciliation, the base for any sustainable democratisation and development."
"June 29, 2006","In this paper we present historical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the origins of political stability and instability in Colombia for the period 1850-1950, and their relationship to political, particularly electoral, institutions. We show that the driving force behind institutional change over this period, specifically the move to proportional representation (PR), was the desire of the Conservative and Liberal parties to come up with a way of credibly dividing power to avoid civil war and conflict, a force intensified by the brutal conflict of the War of a Thousand days between 1899 and 1902. The problem with majoritarian electoral institutions was that they did not allocate power in a way which matched the support of the parties in the population, thus encouraging conflict. The strategic advantage of PR was that it avoided such under-representation. The parties however could not initially move to PR because it was not 'fraud proof' so instead, in 1905, adopted the 'incomplete vote' which simply allocated 2/3 of the legislative seats to the winning party and 1/3 to the loser. This formula brought peace. The switch to PR arose when the Liberals became confident that they could solve problems of fraud. But it only happened because they were able to exploit a division within the Conservatives. The switch also possibly reflected a concern with the rising support for socialism and the desire to divide power more broadly. Our findings shed new light on the origins of electoral systems and the nature of political conflict and its resolution."
"June 14, 2006","This paper analyzes the public policies that lead to 'Katrina,' paying  particular attention to political decisions that created unusual risks in the New Orleans area. Most of the deaths from hurricane Katrina were concentrated in one place, New Orleans, and those losses arose in large part from its location in combination with its three century long effort to '`manage'' the risks associated with that location. Crisis management is inherently more error prone than ordinary policy making, because surprise implies the existence of significant information problems and urgency implies that time does not exist to completely address those problems (Congleton, 2005). In New Orleans the unavoidable mistakes of crisis management were compounded by policy choices made well before Katrina made landfall, as well as federalism, partisan politics, corruption, and incompetence."
"June 13, 2006","The premise of the ""hot topics"" panel at the 2005 AALS convention was that the Rehnquist Court had in 2004 retreated from its bolder conservatism, asserting itself on the side of individual liberty against a federal government that had grown increasingly cavalier toward civil liberties during three years of a war on terror and two decades of a renewed war on crime. Proof of the premise was said to be found in a pair of Sixth Amendment cases, Crawford v. Washington  and Blakely v. Washington,  and also in the trilogy of terrorism cases, Rumsfeld v. Padilla,  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, and Rasul v. Bush."
"June 08, 2006","Stunned by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration adopted a new National Security Strategy in September 2002. The UK government took a similar stance. This new strategy calls for anticipatory attacks against potential enemies with uncertain capacities and intentions, even before their threat is imminent. Rather than wait for evidence of weapons of mass destruction, it shifts the burden of proof, obliging ""rogue"" states to show that they do not harbor weapons of mass destruction or terrorist cells, or else face the possibility of attack. This new strategy amounts to the adoption of the Precautionary Principle against the risk of terrorism. We offer two main conclusions about precaution against terrorism. First, any action taken to reduce a target risk always poses the introduction of countervailing risks. Moreover, a precautionary approach to terrorism is likely to entail larger, more expensive interventions, so the expected opportunity costs are likely to be higher. While considering worst-case scenarios is important for the development of sound policy, taking action based only on worst-case thinking can introduce unforeseen dangers and costs. We argue that a better approach to managing risk involves an assessment of the full portfolio of risks - those reduced by the proposed intervention, as well as those increased. We argue that decision makers developing counterterrorism measures need mechanisms to ensure that sensible risk analysis precedes precautionary actions. Such a mechanism currently exists to review and improve or reject proposed precautionary measures against health and environmental risks, but not, so far, for counterterrorism and national security policies. We urge the creation of such a review mechanism."
"May 29, 2006","The article explores the Israeli Supreme Court main judgment regarding the legality of the use of special interrogation methods in order extract information concerning future acts of terror. The Judgment's main conclusion was that while there might be a justification for using exceptional interrogation measures in order to save lives, based on the concept of lesser evil as embedded in the criminal defense of necessity, the government is nevertheless not authorized to use such means in the absence of explicit legislation to that effect. The article presents and evaluates the Judgment, particularly the relation between the substantive moral questions involved and the aspect of authorization."
"May 24, 2006","This paper provides an original study into how democratization and globalization influence transnational terrorism - examining the motives of terrorists and how democratic institutions and international integration influence non-state economic actors. We employ a gravity model to investigate the relative importance of globalization and democratization on transnational terrorism and external conflict. We construct an original database of over 200,000 observations from 1968-2003 for 189 countries, to examine the extent to which economic, political and historical factors influence the likelihood of citizens from one country to engage in terrorist activities against another. We find that the advent of democratic institutions, high income and more openness in a source country significantly reduces conflict. However, the advent of these same positive developments in targeted countries actually increases conflict. Ceteris paribus, the impact of being a democracy or participating in the WTO/IMF for a source country decreases the number of terrorist strikes by about 2 to 3 per year, which is more than two standard deviations greater than the average number of strikes between any two countries in a given year."
"May 24, 2006","Serbia has two autonomous provinces, with nearly identical constitutional and political claims: heavily Albanian Kosovo and ethnically diverse but Serb-majority Vojvodina. One is headed towards some form of internationally recognized independence; the other almost certainly is not, even though calls for its autonomy have been mounting. What makes the difference?"
"May 19, 2006","Despite empirical evidence that relationship conflict hampers team performance, recent cultural psychology theories have posited that European Americans underestimate the negative influence of relationship conflict. Consistent with research on Protestant Relational Ideology, a crosscultural experiment showed that compared with Koreans, European Americans were less likely to believe that relationship conflict - but not task conflict - limits a team's ability to succeed. European Americans were also more likely to join a talented team despite its likelihood of experiencing relationship conflict. Furthermore, secondary analyses showed that the cultural effect observed in participants' decisions to join the potentially conflict-ridden team was related to participants' beliefs about whether relationship conflict is detrimental to team performance."
"May 18, 2006","The tragedy of East Timor in 2000 coming so soon after that of Kosovo focused attention on the weaknesses of previous United Nations missions that have been ad hoc, reactive, and narrowly focused on solving the international emergency of the moment. The United Nations and its Members need to focus on the need for timely intervention to save civilian populations from mass slaughter. It must adopt a new role as the assertive custodian of human rights because the use of its enforcement powers in the domestic affairs of rogue States may have a deterrent effect. Therefore, it should lead the way in defining its interventionist role in the emerging international norm of humanitarian intervention."
"May 09, 2006","This Article examines the decision by the ICTY Prosecutor not to investigate NATO's bombing campaign during the Kosovo war - and the Prosecutor's unusual decision to publish an Inquiry explaining its reasons. Many scholars have examined the Inquiry, but all have focused on its substantive legal analysis. This Article takes a different approach: It focuses on how the Prosecution reached the conclusion not to investigate. Using rhetorical analysis, it examines the Prosecution's decision-making mindset to see what that indicates about the shape of future international prosecutorial decision-making, including at the ICC."
"April 21, 2006","This article, published in a special post 9-11 issue of the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, offers a defense of the view that terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden should be tried, if captured, outside of regular US civilian courts and in some form of military commission."
"March 13, 2006","This paper provides an overview of the politics of crisis management using a minor, but significant extension of the core rational choice models of political decision making. The focus of analysis is crisis management within democratic polities, although much of it will also apply to crisis management within private organizations and indeed for personal crises. The analysis has several general implications for the politics of crisis management and for designing routine procedures for crisis management. As demonstrated below, an important and unavoidable property of crisis management is an unusually high propensity for making policy errors. Standing procedures for dealing with crises should be designed with such mistakes in mind."
"January 30, 2006","Who chooses suicide attacks? Though rebels typically target poor countries, suicide attacks are just as likely to target rich democracies. Though many groups have grievances, suicide attacks are favored by the radical religious. Though rebels often kill coreligionists, they seldom use suicide attacks to do so. We model the choice of tactics by rebels, bearing in mind that a successful suicide attack imposes the ultimate cost on the attacker and the organization. We first ask what a suicide attacker would have to believe to be deemed rational. We then embed the attacker and other operatives in a club good model which emphasizes the function of voluntary religious organizations as providers of benign local public goods. The sacrifices which these groups demand solve a free-rider problem in the cooperative production of public goods. These sacrifices make clubs well suited for organizing suicide attacks, a tactic in which defection by operatives (including the attacker) endangers the entire organization. The model also analyzes the choice of suicide attacks as a tactic, predicting that suicide will be used when targets are well protected and when damage is great. Those predictions are consistent with the patterns described above. The model has testable implications for tactic choice of terrorists and for damage achieved by different types of terrorists, which we find to be consistent with the data."
"January 26, 2006","This paper uses scoring matching techniques and event study analysis to elucidate the impact of terrorism across different economic sectors. Using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a case study, we differentiate between Israeli companies that belong to the defense, security or anti-terrorism related industries and other companies. The findings show that whereas terrorism has a significant negative impact on non defense-related companies, the overall effect of terrorism on defense and security-related companies is significantly positive. Similarly, using panel data on countries' defense expenditures and imports from Israel, we find that terror fatalities in Israel have a positive effect on Israeli exports of defense products. These results suggest that the expectation of future high levels of terrorism has important implications for resource allocation across industries."
"January 20, 2006","The potential loss of state stability in various parts of the world is a source of threat to U.S. national security. Every case is unique, but there are common processes. Accordingly, we develop a system dynamics model of state stability by representing the nature and dynamics of 'loads' generated by insurgency activities, on the one hand, and by articulating the core features of state resilience and its 'capacity' to withstand these 'loads', on the other. The problem is to determine and 'predict' when threats to stability override the resilience of the state and, more important, to anticipate propensities for 'tipping points', namely conditions under which small changes in anti-regime activity can generate major disruptions. On this basis, we then identify appropriate actionable mitigation factors to decrease the likelihood of 'tipping' and enhance prospects for stability."
"January 03, 2006","The appearance of suicide terrorism in the streets of Israel's cities in the early 1990s demonstrated the changes in the characteristics of terrorism, which Israel and many other countries have had to contend with. The shift in the nature of terrorism has had clear ramifications for the way democratic nations counter terrorism and shows that there is a need to focus not only on active offensive methods but, at the same time, to develop defensive methods of dealing with a terror attack."
"September 29, 2005","""Everything is very simple in war,"" said Carl von Clausewitz, ""but the simplest thing is difficult.""  This essay will suggest that the resort to the language of war, as ""natural"" and ""starkly simple"" as it is, nevertheless has a profound impact on how the law's intervention is shaped, or how the laws governing the transnational use of force are interpreted to accommodate a ""war"" on terrorism.  I argue that although ""war"" is absent from the principal international legal instruments by which states are guided (and obligated) in their relations with other states, the concepts suppressed by this elision have an evocative power that, when revealed or excavated by the promulgation of a war against terror, shapes both the legal justifications for action as between states and, as such, the legal norms and standards themselves.  Thus, war and its rhetoric may indeed create norms, but politics is as much within the service of language as language is of politics.  The meaning of law is always located at this intersection.  It is in order to see this relation, and to clarify the motives and consequences that entail in the alternative legal and discursive responses to terror following September 11, that this essay begins with a rhetorical analysis of the word and its relationship to law."
"July 28, 2005","This paper attempts to provide an alternative analysis of the unique features of social conflict in Korea in that it draws upon the cultural vocabulary of Korean society in depticting and explaining the characteristics of conflict. It touches upon the unusual frequency, duration, radicalness, violence, unlawfulness, selfishness, etc. in describing social conflict as a form of all-or-nothing ki-contest, and goes into the historical and cultural background to explain why such characteristics have emerged in this society. A few distinct cultural orientations including strong emotionalism, collective selfishness, power-status-seeking orientation, black-and-white mentality, egalitarian impulses, breach of the rules of the game, a lack of ability to manage and resolve conflict effectively, and the like, are brought in to interpret the unique features of social conflict in Korea."
"May 26, 2005","This paper analyzes the impact of terrorism on Israeli companies related to the defense, security or anti-terrorism industries, relative to its impact on the rest of the companies. The authors match every Israeli company to the American company with the closest expected return among all the companies that belong to the same industry and trade in the same market in order to isolate the effect of terrorism from other common industry shocks. The findings show that whereas terrorism had a significant negative impact of 5% on non defense-related companies, it had a significantly positive overall effect of 7% on defense-related companies."

"November 17, 2004","The onset of the American Civil War forced both the Confederate and Union governments to swiftly develop strategies to fund their military efforts. Focusing on the Confederacy's financial policies, I take up the following puzzle: Why did the Confederacy rely almost exclusively on inflation financing, waiting to enact any significant tax legislation until the Winter of 1863, while the Union embarked on a successful financial strategy effectively combining loans, notes, and taxes? From the confident vantage point of twenty-twenty hindsight, the south's choices may seem to have been irrational in a war against a more resourceful and asset rich state. I argue that southerners were not irrational, nor were northerners exceptionally shrewd. Rather the ideological predispositions developed over the antebellum period were carried over into Civil War politics. Generally, the northern Republicans' support of a national banking system, a large national debt, and taxes turned out to be vital to finance the war. While the southern Democrats' opposition to national financial institutions, a large public debt, as well as taxes to protect their most valued assets, slaves, led to financial policies that proved to be disastrous. Despite their predispositions, not all southerners were blindly committed to their policy choices. Once the war turned significantly against the Confederacy in the Summer and Fall of 1863, legislators updated their beliefs about the probability of success and began to reevaluate their preferences for financial policies. I find that legislators from states with large slave assets were more likely to oppose tax legislation throughout the war, while representatives from states that would face the largest political and social turmoil after emancipation were more likely to support tax policies after the Fall of 1863. To evaluate the relationship between preferences and policy choices, I analyze roll call data by estimating population-average models using generalized estimating equations (GEE)."
"April 04, 2004","This paper shows that international policy coordination is not counterproductive in a world where the incentive to run beggar-thy-neighbor policies internationally arises from the inefficiency that characterizes, within each country, the interaction between policymakers and private agents. The domestic inefficiency arises from the presence of nominal contracts that give central banks the power to affect real variables. In this setting we show that international cooperation belongs to central banks' dominant strategy. The paper is motivated by a common and misleading interpretation of a paper by Rogoff [1985], namely that international cooperation may be counterproductive in the presence of a domestic inefficiency."
"November 11, 2003","We explore cultural aspects of globalization and provide a model to illuminate some possible effects of globalization on the politics of redistribution within nations. The argument of the paper is as follows. Globalization is an extension of nationalism (not its antithesis) with regard to some aspects of culture and economic structure: it promotes cultural standardization and economic integration across national boundaries. But unlike nationalism, globalization does this without providing either the international cultural solidarity or governmental institutions capable of supporting egalitarian redistribution and insurance on a global scale, while weakening the nation-based institutions for the same. In this respect a globalized world may recreate the social structure of the archetypal agrarian empire: a dominant English-speaking class of cosmopolitans presiding over a heterogeneous and provincial underclass with little solidarity across the language groups and weak nationally-based instruments of social insurance and egalitarian redistribution."

This article studies the nation's reaction through a sociological lens. Following high-profile crimes, the public often panics, targeting marginal sub-communities with anger and new regulations. This phenomenon is often termed 'moral panic.' After technological catastrophes, however, public blame is typically more diffuse, taking the form of 'risk society panics' that focus not only on individuals and sub-communities, but also socially powerful institutions such as corporations and the government.  September 11 was a combination of crime and technological catastrophe - criminals killed thousands of people by subverting technology, taking advantage of the dangers inherent to air travel, high rise buildings, and the like. Public reaction reflected this ambiguity."

"July 25, 2000","The central claim of a rapidly growing literature in international relations is that members of pairs of democratic states are much less likely to engage each other in war or in serious disputes short of war than are members of other pairs of states. Our analysis does not support this claim.  Instead, we find that the dispute rate between democracies is lower than is that of other country pairs only after World War II.  Before 1914 and between the World Wars, there is no difference between the war rates of members of democratic pairs of states and those of members of other pairs of states.  We also find that there is a higher incidence of serious disputes short of war between democracies than between nondemocracies before 1914. We attribute this cross-temporal variation in dispute rates to changes in patterns of common and conflicting interests across time. We use alliances as an indicator of common interests to show that cross-temporal variation in dispute rates conforms to variations in interest patterns for two of the three time periods in our sample."
"February 10, 2000","This paper develops a theory of political violence that is based on the rationality of individual agents. Violence is shown to be negatively related to the availability of alternative means of acquiring political goods and to the availability of alternative economic opportunities. Under quite general assumptions, the theory also predicts that the level of political violence in a society will have an inverted U-shaped relationship to the level of state repression; violence will be low under low- and high- levels of repression and will peak at middling levels of repression. In a series of tests using pooled cross-sectional/time series data, the model is shown to outperform a number of existing relative deprivation and social disorganization theories of political violence."
